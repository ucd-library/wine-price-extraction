Not long ago, we were privileged to
attend the celebration of the 75th
birthday of Henri Gouges, and at
that occasion we drank the wines of
Nuits-St. Georges produced by his
grandfather, then his father, and
finally himself. The heritage of this
great man, the founder of ‘Appella-
tion Controlée’ in Burgundy, is now
carried on by his two dedicated sons,
Michel and Marcel. We are proud to
offer his wines, the best of Nuits, to
the Burgundy drinkers of the United
States.
In an area where a man’s wine prop-
erty is measured, row by row, the
Gouges Domaine is unique—it culti-
vates 23 acres of some of the choic-
est wine real estate. When you pull
the cork from either of these two
wines, you will detect the exception-
ally delicious gout de terroir (taste
of soil). Because of finesse, ‘les St.
Georges’ generally takes the honors
as the best wine produced in the
commune.

The ‘tastevin’ or ‘silver tasting
cup’ represents the warmth and
hospitality of Burgundy.

Jean Ponsot

Only last week, we took a bottle of
Ponsot’s Clos de la Roche 1966 from
our cellars and tasted it. In the com-
pany of objective wine authorities,
the universal verdict was “one of the
greatest red Burgundies we have
ever tasted, regardless of price.”
And M. Ponsot claims his 1969 is
even better! Our advice is to acquire
a few bottles of the 1966 while we
still have them—judge it——and if
you agree, reserve a case of his 1969.
Jean Ponsot, unlike most of his
neighbors, sticks to old-fashioned
methods and simply refuses to de-
stem when vinifying his wines—the
result is that they are big, deep
tannic, slow-maturing and excep-
tionally long-lived. This is not only
true for Clos de la Roche, but also
for his other vineyard holdings in
Chambolle-Musigny and Chamber-

 

tin.

Prince de Merode, of the royal
family of Belgium.

Prince de Merode

NOBLE indeed are the wines vini-
fied by Prince de Merode, the cousin
of King Baudouin of Belgium. His
love of the soil and its wines matches
despite his regal backgrou nd, the af-
fection of his farmer neighbors.

The Merode holdings are in the very
best ‘Téte de Cuvée’ vineyards of
Aloxe-Corton, crowned by the king
of them all—Corton, Clos du Roi—
which does not deign to bow its head
in deference to any other Cru of the
entire Cote d’Or. The Aloxe-Corton,
comes from ‘Premier Cru’ holdings,
and is superb. Here we are dealing
with the longest-lived wines of the
Cote de Beaune, exhibiting extraor-
dinary breed and texture, amazingly
silky and beautiful balance—the
best since 1961. Delivery — Spring
1971.

Henri Lamarche
Mr. Lamarche is to the wine world
of Burgundy what Alfred Knopf is
to the publishing world—an uncon-
tested symbol of uncompromising
excellence. His holdings in the great
vineyards are astonishing—his cel-
lars wind their way, cave after cave,
under half the town of Vosne-
Romanée. Just gaze at the names
shown below — they are emperors

among wines.

 

 

Tasting in the cellars of Henri
Lamarche.

And the crowning jewel of them all
is the tiny 3.3 acre corridor known
as ‘La Grande Rue’ which separates
La Tache and Romanée-Conti. All of
Mr. Lamarche’s wines are long on
finesse and style, as the good wines
of Vosne-Romanée should be, and
are destined to mature with elegant
grace. They can be considered among
the noblest wines being produced in
Burgundy today.
