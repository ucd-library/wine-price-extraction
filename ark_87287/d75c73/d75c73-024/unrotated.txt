Bachelet-Ramonet

Young Jean Bachelet is considered
something of a “boy wonder’, for
though he is not yet 36 he has im-
portant holdings in several vine-
yards where he produces red and
white Burgundy of distinction,
finesse and beauty.

 

In Burgundy, you will find al-
most as many women working
the vineyards as men.

The Ramonet family (there are sev-
eral branches) are probably the
most important single influence in
stepping up the quality and reputa-
tion of the wine commune of Chas-
sagne. Candidly, we do not see how
any white Burgundy can be much
better than the ‘Ruchottes.’ We
know of no better example of fruity,
red Burgundy anywhere near it in
price than ‘Boudriottes.’ Both will
h us during the Spring of 1971.

Much rivalry exists between the
sister towns of ‘Puligny’ and ‘Chas-
sagne,’ because they equally share
the 20 acre Montrachet vineyard,
and both have affixed this celebrated
name as a suffix to the village name.
As the villagers gather at the local
bistro, they are heard to exclaim,
“Etienne Sauzet’s children are full
in body, rich, of amazing flower, and
endowed with heady masculinity.”
And the fame of his wines has now
reached the outer world, as indicated
by the fact that M. Sauzet is now
one of the largest and most re-
spected proprietors of Puligny, and
proudly heads the ‘‘Syndicat d’
Initiative.”

 

 

 

Etienne Sauzet is a civilized man
and a natural leader. He proudly
heads the local ‘‘Syndicated’

Initiative.’’

Here are two of his best, wines fea-
tured by the best restaurants from
Paris to the Cote d’ Azur, and they
will arrive to be part of your cellar
by the Spring of 1971.

Marcel Niellon

The important wine-producing
township of Chassagne-Montrachet
has about 750 acres on the vine, with
about 800 (a high proportion) earn-
ing the exalted classification of ‘Pre-
mier Cru’ or ‘Grand Cru.’
In this Cartier-like atmosphere,
Marcel Niellon and his son own and
cultivate tiny parcels of vineyard
land on the choicest slopes, produc-
ing the jewels listed below. Should
their total production approach
1,000 cases, they are happy—and the
wine world will be grateful for re-
ceiving them.

Here they are in all their glory, and
they will be available to you for de-
livery during the Spring of 1971.

LOIRE VALLEY

The vignerons of the Loire Valley
bless nature for the excellence be-
stowed upon them during the 1969
vintage. Since it is man’s duty to
bring out the best that nature has to
provide, we offer only the best
estate-bottled growers of the three
most important growing areas.

The Muscadet is ‘sur-lie,’ which is
not only light, elegant, and dry, but
means that the barrel has never been
racked, thus enriching the flavor. It
is estate-bottled by Chateau les
Montys.

The Sancerre is from the Delaporte
family, the first who estate-bottled
Sancerre, and that was over 25 years

ago. It goes well with the goat-
cheese that is also produced locally
Here is a white wine that is truly
dry, elegant, possessing the most de-
lightful bouquet.

M. Gaudry, is deservedly proud of
his estate-bottled Pouilly-Blane
Fumé, particularly in 1969. Here is
the wine that is the rage of Paris,
now reaching a new height in har-
mony, fruit and freshness.

All three of these wines will be
available for delivery during Sep-
tember, immediately after return
from your summer activities. They
will fortify you when greeting the
Autumn season.

COTES-DU-RHONE
1969 in the Rhone Valley was 30%
short in quantity, and opened at 25%
higher than it did in 1968. Their red
wines represent outstanding value.
With Burgundy prices reaching such
high levels, it is surprising indeed
that the cost of Chateauneuf-du-
Pape has not gone up even further.
The Cotes-du-Rhone Rouge offered
here is pleasant, soft, wonderfully
inexpensive, and the kind of wine
you would be drinking today dining
at the country inns between Mar-
seilles and Lyon. Will arrive this
October.

The Chateauneuf-du-Pape is a pre-
cocious wonder, gathered during a
fine harvest, and grown at an impor-
tant estate that overlooks the pic-
turesque Papal town below. It has
ten good years ahead of it. However,
you can start drinking it pleasur-
ably soon after its arrival during the
Spring of 1971.
