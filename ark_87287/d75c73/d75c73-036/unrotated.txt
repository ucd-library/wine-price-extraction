THE ‘GRAND CRU’ VINEYARDS in the com-
mune of Gevrey-Chambertin represents to the
world of ‘Wine’ what Leonardo da Vinci, Cezanne
and Picasso represent to the world of ‘Art’. There
are only 22 ‘Grand Cru’ vineyards in the entire
Cote de Nuits—and nine of them can be found in
Gevrey-Chambertin alone—and all nine of them
bear the vineyard expression ‘Chambertin’ as part
of their name. Perhaps the greatest is Chambertin
itself, but in the same exalted league can be found
Mazoyeres-Chambertin, Charmes-Chambertin, and
Latricieres-Chambertin—‘Grand Cru’ vineyards
and all jewels in the glorious crown of Burgundy.
To understand how rare they are, the entire land
area of these four vineyards combined, is but 124.2
acres, producing hardly more than 10,000 cases a
year combined to satisfy the thirsty demand of
discriminating Burgundy lovers throughout the
world. No wonder they are hard to come by, costly,
and much appreciated, when finally the cork is
drawn.

Alexis Lichine, in his Encyclopedia, states,
“Chambertin is big and sturdy with a deep, strong
color and a pronounced lingering and glorious
aftertaste. The nose is so outspoken, that bouquet
—the usual term, fades into insignificance. The
wine improves with age, developing the wonderful,
austere masculinity which causes exverts to ex-
claim ‘Chambertin’—and novices enthusiastically
ery out ‘great wine’.

WHO IS CAMUS? He is the proud Burgundian
vineyard owner, who has been handed down

Each of these vineyards is one of the
nine ‘Grand Cru’ of the great Burgun-
dian Commune of Gevrey-Chamber-
tin. Each is estate-bottled by Camus.

1966— Outstanding. Great
fragrance, fruit and superb
balance. Shows remark-
able promise of longevity.

 

through the generations, important parcels of
land, occupying some of the best soil of these four
great Grand Cru vineyards. Mr. Camus does not
compromise—he cultivates soil and vine care care-
fully, he nurtures the young wine during its barrel
life, and then carefully bottles only what he grows
himself, on his own vineyard land, rejecting any
wine that does not meet his high standards of ap-

pellation and quality. Indeed, we are dealing with
jewels!

AND NOW A WORD ABOUT THE PRICES.
Many of you are aware that today, Chambertin
1966 easily commands over $12 the bottle and will
soon be $15. The other three ‘Grand Cru’, includ-
ing Mazoyeres-Chambertin, are offered at prices
that range from $7 to $9 the bottle—and these,
too, will soon be higher. We know of no better way
to persuade you to acquire these truly great Estate
bottlings now than to simvly ask you to look at the
vineyards and prices shown here—all are offered
dramatically below the current world market
prices. It is no exaggeration to state that the 1969
vintage of Chambertin, still in wood, is being
rationed in Burgundy at $100 the case—and at
that only doled out, barrel by barrel, to favored
clients.

We consider this offering one of the last oppor-
tunities to acquire the great ‘Grand Cru’, Estate-
bottled vineyards of the Chambertin area, all of
great vintage year, at a price that has not yet
pierced the sound barrier. Quantity limited and
subject to prior sale.

1964—rich in fruit, well bal-
anced, big and sturdy. Suf-
ficient depth and staying
power to indicate many
glorious years ahead.

1962—in Burgundy, is not
simply good, but can be
considered ‘great’. Red
Burgundies ideally suited
for present drinking—
scarce, hard to come by in
‘Grand Cru’ Estate bottlings.

The great ‘Grand Cru’ wines
of Chambertin from the ‘Do-
maine de Camus Pere & Fils’,
because of their scarcity and
magnificence, have long been
among the most sought-after
of all red Burgundies by the
Serious wine drinkers of the
world. We proudly offer their
great wine glories, of the out-
standing vintage years of ’66,
64 and ’62. The prices, as you
Can see, are dramatically low
for distinguished Estate bot-
tlings of such exalted heritage.
We suggest early acquisition
before they disappear from the
world market.
