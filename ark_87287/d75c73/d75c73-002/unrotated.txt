739 CHABLIS 1969 (Burgundy)........ 1.89 20.40
This is not Petit Chablis, but from superior vineyards, entitled to the
superior classification ‘Chablis.’ It was only the massive buying of
Nicolas, the largest wine merchant in the world, that made it possible for
us to offer a dry wine of such pedigree at such a price—particularly in
light of the fact that 1969 Chablis fetched 40% more than preceeding years.

of only $1.99 the bottle. It is at its fresh best now and will continue so for

It takes its name from the Rio Oja, a tributary of the River Ebro, not far

which give it sufficient acidity and freshness, thus not permitting the full
body to dominate.

color, light, fresh, without excessive acidity.
