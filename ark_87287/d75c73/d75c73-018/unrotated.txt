We at Sherry’s could not accept un-
equivocably the fantastic praise
showered upon the ‘1969 vintage”
by newspapers, television, and trav-

ellers r etur ning from European
vineyards. We resolved to get to the
bottom of it. As we go to press dur-
ing June of 1970, we have heard
from the owners of the great vine-
yards of Bordeaux, Burgundy, Ger-
many and the other important areas
of Europe. In addition, we have
visited the vineyards twice since the
harvest of 1969 and have tasted the
wines first hand—all this supple-
mented by expert testimony pro-
vided by the most highly regarded
vineyard owners of Europe. We do
consider this a most fair appraisal
as of this date (June 11), with the
ultimate decision left to the judg-
ment of the wine lovers of the next
decade.

BURGUNDY

All eyes were turned to the auction
of Burgundy wines, held each year
at the Hospice de Beaune—the high-
est bid at the time the candle goes
out claims the prize barrel of wine.
It took place on Sunday, November
16th, and history was made. The
combination of vintage optimism
and shortage of stocks led to run-
away prices. The ‘Corton’ reached
the enormous price of 13,000 francs
per cask of 24 dozen bottles. In 1967
the price for this same wine was
0,000 francs. To judge the smallness
of the crop, only 305 casks were
being offered at the auction, com-
pared to 574 two years ago. We must
understand that these are grower’s
prices, to which must be added the
cost of care, interest, bottling
charges, shipping costs, duty, and
trade profits. Based on raw costs,
and, if we assume normal profit, this
Corton’ should sell for about $200.00
the case two years from now!

However, all is not negative, and let
us add our voices to the chorus of

hurrahs’ and extoll the quality vir-
tues of the wines produced along the

amed “Cote d’ Or” during the his-
toric 1969 vintage. The eyes of the
Burgundy growers light up, when

they offered us their ’69s. And justi-
fiably so, because their cellars until
now could only offer the poverty-
stricken 1968 or a spotty, hesitant
bid towards excellence made by the
relatively unreliable vintage of 1967.
It was only due to the traditional
loyalty shown by conservative

growers that supply us that makes
it possible for Sherry’s to present
within these pages such an extensive
ollection of Burgundies at prices
hardly more expensive, relatively,
than those of the fine 1966’s that
were offered three years ago.

Undoubtedly, Burgundy was the
‘Star’ of France during the 1969
harvest. The red wines are already
beginning to show their fine color,
excellent bouquet (a typical charac-
teristic of the ’69 vintage), good
body, balance, style, and staying
power. While not quite as fat and
rich as the ’61’s, the best cuvées are
not far removed from the best that
that remarkable vintage—1961—
had to offer.

And, let us not overlook the ‘white
Burgundies’—they are excellently
balanced, fruity, fine, and are des-
tined to be greatly appreciated as
they develop with the passage of
time. These ‘whites’ are not quite as
fat as the ’62’s—nor do they have
the hardness and austerity of the
'61’s—rather, they represent a
happy compromise between the two
styles. Here are white Burgundies

Fall of 1971, and still be assured
that most of them will be good for at
least another five years, and the
‘great ones’ will thrive for another
decade.

 
  

RED BORDEAUX

The chateau owners of Bordeaux are
now recovering from their ‘“‘cliff-
hanger” adventures that fell to their
lot during the 1969 harvest. It all
started with a mild winter and
ended with glorious sunny days dur-
ing the October gathering. For
much of the year, the blood-pressure
of the vignerons zig-zagged up and
down the scale—from moments of
deep despair to the ultimate climax
of high elation. We know of no better
way to provide insight into the vin-
tage, and to help you become aware
of what chateau owners experienced,
than simply to summarize the diary
that was kept, day by day, by one of
the most erudite and capable vine-
yard proprietors of Bordeaux. His
diary, in capsule, is below:

MARCH—We are grateful for a
mild winter.

        

ing is a bit behind sched-
ule this year.

J UNE—The flowering of the vine is
a bit late this year. We are losing
some of the crop due to a certain
amount of ‘coulure,’ or the failure
of some blossoms to be properly pol-
lenated; the embryo grapes never
developing, and eventually falling
off. This does not bother the quality,
but unfortunately reduces the size
of the crop.

AUGUST—The month started off
fine, but the last ten days were dark-
ened by clouds; the temperature was
slightly above average—the rainfall
negligible. The vines are ‘suffering’
from lack of water, but this may
mean that we may have a rich con-
centrated, and possibly, ‘great wine.’
I have heard mutterings from my
neighbors of “another 1961.” There
does not seem much that can go
wrong since there are only six weeks
to go before the vintage will be
safely resting in our vats.

SEPTEMBER —It has been raining
23 days out of 30, achieving an al-
most record rainfall reaching 207
millimeters. Happily, the last days
of September are proving fine. If
October follows suit, we will come
out all right.

OCTOBER—The moment of ‘“‘truth”’
is now arriving. We are sustained
by the fine weather of July and the
satisfactory weather of August, to
assure that the essential elements
that make for outstanding wine are
all there. The danger was the exces-
sive rain in September—if we do not
get a weather break, it will cause
the grapes to rot. Everything con-
spired to help us—the work took
