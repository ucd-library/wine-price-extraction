COMMENTS APPEAR BELOW.

“Tt is not often that any follower of the wine trail comes
across a cellar secreting about 30,000 or so bottles of fine, old
Burgundy. The treasure trove in question belonged to the late
Dr. Albert Barolet, who died, aged 71, in 1969. He came from

thick were the cobwebs (or fungus) that I found outside of
some of the bins that I mistook them for a solid, black wall.
Descending into them, as I did in September, I felt as if I were
entering an Aladdin’s Cave. Here was truly a Rip Van Winkle

for collecting the best wines of Burgundy.

The possibility of acquiring wines from the Dr. Barolet col-
lection is surely a heaven-sent opportunity for the younger
generation to experience for themselves the kind of Burgundy
their fathers and grandfathers speak about and enjoyed.”
