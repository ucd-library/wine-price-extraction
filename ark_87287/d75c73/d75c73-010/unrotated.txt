Beaujolais Broutlly 1969

which won the Gold
Award at the Macon Fair, is the proud, estate-bottled wine
grown at Chateau de la Chaize, one of the noblest and most
highly regarded vineyards of all Beaujolais. Here is wine
bottled within four months of the harvest — the kind of
Beaujolais that they are drinking in Paris, Lyon, Biarritz
and Cote d’Azur. Throughout France they serve it slightly

burgers, chickens and steak that comes off the charcoal grill.

vineyard, in the famed
wine growing district of Brouilly, has been maintained, from
father to son, for over four centuries by the Marquis de
Roussy de Sales family. Tradition dictates that they never

rolling hills of Beaujolais cultivating the vine.

Here, we are not dealing with a nondescript Beaujolais, but
rather with an estate-bottled Brouilly produced on some of
the best soil of the district, and during the truly great 1969
vintage. Since every bottle comes from the estate, and it was
not blended, the total production falls much below the world
demand. As a consequence, we urge that you anticipate your
