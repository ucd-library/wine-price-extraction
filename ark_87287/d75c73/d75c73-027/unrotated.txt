than 1953. Magnificently balanced.

— Squeezed between the publicized ’47s and ’49s. The
true merit of this year were not recognized until re-

cently. These two “First Growths” are worth double
the price in terms of what they taste like after the cork

is drawn.

—Heads are bowed when ‘1947’ is mentioned.
Bordeaux experts consider ‘Cheval Blanc 1947’ the
greatest single claret extant, and it is amazing that any
escaped to America.

— A good, but not great year. Ideal selection for those
who want a ‘three-decade-old’ claret at relatively
modest cost.

— A glorious vintage from the pre-World War II days:

Haut Brion and Latour are great and classic — the
Desmirail has lost its vineyard identity and has be-

come part of Chateau Palmer.
