A Classic Work

 

The color photographs that you see
throughout these pages all appear
here through the courtesy of Time-
Life Books and represent only a small
portion of the many vivid photo-
graphs that enliven their newly issued
book ‘‘Wines and Spirits’. Each was
taken by Arie deZanger who went to
the major wine areas of the world,
and then spent a month in the test
kitchen taking pictures for this
volume.

The wine and spirit text was authored
by Alec Waugh, the prominent Brit-
ish writer. The editorial consultant on
this book was Sam Aaron, our asso-
ciate at Sherry-Lehmann, Inc. The
technical consultants were Alexis
Bespaloff, a wine writer and importer
and Andre Gros-Daillon who super-
vised the testing of all drink recipes.
‘Wines and Spirits’ is an indispens-
able guide, rich in illustrations and
factual material that covers the vast
range of hard spirits as well as wines.

The book is available as part of the
FOOD OF THE WORLD series at a
cost of $4.95. Should you want fur-
ther information, please write Time-
