THE BEST RED WINES OF BEAUJOLAIS

BEAUJOLAIS 1967—has just arrived by fast steamer—bottled within three
months of grape-picking—the kind of Beaujolais they are drinking in Paris
today—the kind of beaujolais that will delight your friends as a Christmas
gift and add much cheer to your holiday entertainment.

This represents an historic event—the first time that Americans have been able to drink
the Beaujolais of the current year prior to Christmas, just as they do in Paris. The reward
in young Beaujolais is great—rich in fruit; reminiscent of a grape arbor; and like a “pretty
young girl from the farm,” it must be enjoyed during its youth. We strongly advise order-
ing now to be safe—we suspect we will be out-of-stock long before Christmas Day. Reserve
the number of bottles and cases you will require for your Christmas gifts. Here is a true
delight that any wine-lover should not ignore.

BEAUJOLAIS 1966 —-The best for present drinking

The Rt. Hon. Ernest Marples has earned international acclaim as a member of
the British Cabinet and as its Minister of Transport. In addition to being a genius
in construction, he is one of Europe’s most skilled mountain climbers. He now
adds to his repertoire the proud ownership of several vineyards in the Beaujolais
area. Mr. Marples is not a man to comprontise. His wines are truly outstanding
and excellent and the best in their class. We particularly recommend the Fleurie,
which is grown by Ernest Marples and his wife, Ruth. We think you will find
the purple-red color, the fruit and the depth of flavor sufficiently outstanding to
make you value the Marples wines among the best Beaujolais you have ever

tasted.
