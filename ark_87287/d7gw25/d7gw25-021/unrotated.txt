SORE 2 OU RR MM TIE (2S een 1.09 1.59 17.95

A magnificent example of bone dry, pale, straw colored Sherry. This classic ‘Fino Palma’ has helped Wisdom &
Warter achieve its great international reputation, now over a century old. An ideal aperitif when served slightly

chilled.
IGHOT SG ROYAL BROWN OLOROSO. . ..... 2.6m... - 2.19 1.79 19.95

There are few wines produced in the world that quite achieve the rich, deep flavor, or dark color depth of a fine
Brown Sherry. Here is a typical, fully aged example.

Waieealis A VONTICLADO FINO ........... v0 J M.....- 2.49 1.99 22.65

As this name implies, a good Amontillado belongs to the Fino family, but they acquire certain different character-
istics as they mature; the color becomes more amber-like. As in the Finos, they are very dry, more nutty in flavor

and develop greater body.

FGONES COLDENIGREAM ..:.:.........6% es... - 7s. 2.99 2.49 27.95
Generally speaking, a top-flight Cream Sherry such as this is the oldest and most luxurious of the wines found in
the Bodegas of Jerez. Usually, a fine Cream Sherry of a reputable firm commands $5.00 or more the bottle. It is no
ordinary event to obtain this medium dry, dramatically rich, wine for only $2.49. We urge you to try it:
WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE’S DRY OLOROSO ...........----. 3.29 2.69 30.50
The word ‘dry’ appears on the label. However, this is only relatively true. It does not possess the excessive rich
sweetness of most Olorosos because it does have a dry finish.

BeiGGs 1915 AMONTILLADO SOLERA ...........:......-. 4.99 3.49 39.75
A perfect expression of the Amontillado type Sherry. Dry, yet with sufficient body to give it depth of flavor. Cask
laid down in 1915 and periodically refreshed with younger, aged wines.

OS SAC 2d Don) Ugh) PLD Us ee ee 4.99 58.50

Amazing value! — particularly when you consider the fact that Cream Sherries that lack this age and distinction
command a higher price than this in the open market. Quantity limited. Cask laid down in 1914 and periodically
refreshed with younger, aged wines. Consistent with the Spanish Solera system of aging sherries.
