An important wine event is taking place at
Sherry’s—the 1964 Burgundies, among the best
and most enjoyable of our time, are now arriv-
ing to bring their glory to you. Even the lesser
wines are excellent, and the best are fantas-
tically great. Rich in fruit, well balanced, ready
to drink early. On the whole, the 1964 red Bur-
gundies are firmer, and with more depth and
staying power than the '59s.
