ES of th 462 MUSCADET 1960 (Estate, Bidiere) 1.49 16.95
“yp ty The delicate dry white wines of the Loire Valley are becoming increasingly popular

throughout the world. One of the most delightful is “‘Muscadet” which is produced not
far from the town of Nantes. Here it is in all its fresh dry delicacy—sheer perfection for
summer drinking—at the unbelievably low price of only 1.49 the bottle. Certainly one
of the most popular white wines we have ever offered.

6.99 1 497 ANJOU, BLANCS DE BLANC 1.99 22.65

A charming white wine, somewhat reminiscent of the Champagne Natur which
used to reach our shores two decades ago. Dry, delicate, delightful.

107 QUINCY 1959 (Meunier-Lapha) 00.0.0. 2.49 27.95

In the last few years Quincy (which is pronounced ‘Can-see’, and never saw Massachu-
setts) has become a New York summer favorite. It comes from the Loire Valley north
of Bourges; fruity, very dry, comparable to Pouilly-Fume and made from the same
Sauvignon grape. It’s a real discovery.

Here is a 1959 to pay attention to; a fine estate wine from one of the best small growers
of Pouilly. Lay it away for a year or two—it will improve. Drink it now—it will delight
you.

433 SANCERRE 1959 (Estate bottled) 00... 2.49 27.95
1959 provided a magnificent quality in Sancerre. The kind of dry clean racy wine that
Parisians love. We sold out our shipment of a year ago, but it was only by a stroke of
good luck that we have just received another shipment.

470 POUILLY FUME 1959 (Chateau Nozet) 3.95 42.66

If one were looking for the greatest vineyard—the Montrachet of the Loire—he
would find it here at Chateau Nozet. Superb, and the last of the great 1959.
