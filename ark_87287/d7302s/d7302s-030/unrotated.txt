774 HIGH TOR RESERVE 1959 (New York) . 1.99 21.50

Everett Crosby, owns a vineyard only 28 miles from New York on the Hudson, and
each Labor Day weekend we bring our family to picnic lunch, and help him gather the
harvest. It may be coincidence or envy, but anyhow, Mr. Crosby believes his 1959 is a
great vintage year, the best white wine he has ever made, and the cream of his harvest
bears the label ‘Special Reserve” and he charges a little more for it. Here is a wine we
think you will like, it is native to New York and it is our own ‘vin du pays’.
