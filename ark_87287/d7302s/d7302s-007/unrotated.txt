A CLASSIC

sourson.. JOTEINNY REB

All of us here at Sherry’s were excited when we first tasted the Johnny
Reb 6 Year Old Bourbon. It was superb, rich in flavor, yet remarkably
delicate. Made at a small country distillery and kept in oak barrel for
six years until it achieved proper maturation—then bottled as an out-
standing example of sour mash whiskey at 90 proof.
“Johnny Reb” (a name that owes its origin to the practice of the Yankees
who called “Hello Johnny” or “Howdy, Reb” across the battle lines of
the Civil War). To those seeking out fine Kentucky
Bourbon at modest cost, we urge that you try it. § == a4)
For those who wish to acquire this outstanding oD Fitth
Kentucky Bourbon in the economical full quart § p pia
