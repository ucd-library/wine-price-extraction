THE GREAT CHAMPAGNES
OF THE 1952 VINTAGE

Wine experts acclaim the 1952 vintage in Champagne as probably the best
balanced year since the war, a beautiful harmony of fruit, freshness and
bouquet. The last bottles of this year have left the cellars of France. We
offer remarkable examples that should be acquired now by those who wish
to experience Champagne at its absolute best.
