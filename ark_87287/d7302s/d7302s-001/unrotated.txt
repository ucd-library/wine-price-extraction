 

For Those Who Love
the Good Food & Wine

of FRANCE

-An Important Book

The delightful photographs which you
see throughout our brochure are only
a small part of the photographic profile
of France which appears in the won-
derfully illustrated and recently pub-
lished cookbook, “The Flavor of
France,” prepared by the Chamberlain
family.

The photographs (and there are over
200 of them) provide a delightful tour
through French chateaux, cathedrals,
villages and country roads. The recipes
demonstrate the good sense and good
taste of the everyday French cook,
whose kitchen repertoire is less elabo-
rate—and even more delicious—than
many people suppose, and these re-
cipes are adapted gracefully to Ameri-
can methods and menus.

Here is a cookbook that is easy to han-
dle, for also included are the simple
rules for French menu planning, a
check-list of provincial specialties and
famous classic recipes; and a collec-
tion of sample menus.

And now a word about the authors:
many of you are familiar with Samuel
Chamberlain, artist, photographer and
gastronome, and his wife, Narcissa,
expert cook and kitchen tester. This
happy team has now been joined by a
new member, their daughter Narcisse,
who planned and edited the collection
of recipes that appears in the book.

The Chamberlains have learned to
love the tradition of French food dur-
ing their long residence there: A

French cook who once reigned in their
kitchen was the heroine of their first
cookbook ‘‘Clementine in the
Kitchen.” Since then, they have pub-
lished two epic works, “Bouquet de
France” and “Italian Bouquet,” as
well as the annual Chamberlain cal-
endars of French cooking.

We anticipate that many readers will
want to know where they can get a
copy of “The Flavor of France’—the
price is $5.95 and it is published by
Hastings House—, and we are advised
that you simply write FULFILL-
MENT SERVICES, INC., 239 Great
Neck Road, Great Neck, N. Y., and
this indispensable, beautifully illus-
trated cookbook will be sent to you
immediately.
