*271 CLOS DE TART 1959 ................ 4.19 46.25

Estate bottled, J. Mommessin

In the 7th Century a nunnery was founded in the town of Morey, not far from
Gevrey Chambertin, and the Nuns started a vineyard called Clos de Tart.
Today it is the distinguished property of J. Mommessin. Big, sturdy, long
lived, here is one of the crowning jewels of the Cote d’Or.

*280 BONNES MARES 1959 ............ 4.59 49.75

Estate bottled, Domaine Roumier

Many Burgundians believe that one of their best, and least known, of the great
wines of the Cote d’Or, is produced at the Bonnes Mares vineyard. This 1959,
made with knowledge and close care by the young Mayor of Chambolle
Musigny, is unsurpassed and can hold its own against any wine of the Cote d’Or.

Estate bottled, A. Noblet
The wines of Clos de Vougeot vary greatly from one grower’s cellar to another.
M. Noblet, one of Burgundy’s most knowledgeable cellar masters, is rightfully
proud of the wine he produces from this great vineyard. A splendid 1959.
