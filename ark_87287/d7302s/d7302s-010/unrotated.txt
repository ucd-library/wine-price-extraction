THE LOWER TOWN—DINAN Brittany

A Great 19359 Claret Arrives!

Chateau La Tour Carnet
1939

The wine lovers of America have been patiently waiting for the first shipment of
the much heralded 1959 Chateau Bottled Clarets. After two years in barrel, many
of them are now finding their way in bottle and are starting to reach our shores.
The demand for this vintage throughout the world has been overwhelming and the
Bordeaux quotations for the good ones have reached record-breaking heights.
One of the most remarkable examples which we discovered in Bordeaux is
CHATEAU LA TOUR CARNET, a classified Fourth Growth Medoc, enjoying
the same rank in the official classification as Beycheville. The Chateau dates back
to the 13th Century and the quality of its wine has always enjoyed high reputation.
This 1959 is entirely remarkable—full flavored, soft and velvety, and marked with
unusual breed and finesse.

The price at which we are offering this wine is astonishingly low because we do
believe that if we had purchased this wine today, and
not shortly after the harvest, it would command a price $199 BOTTLE
well above $3. We consider this a unique wine oppor-

tunity and strongly advise early acquisition for those

who wish to add a flawless 1959 red Bordeaux to their $7265 Sees
cellars at reasonable cost.

Also available in half bottles at $1.09 each, $24.65 the case, and Magnums

at $4.18 each, $23.65 the case.
