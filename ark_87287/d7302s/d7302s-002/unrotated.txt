THE RIVER DOUBS Franche-Comté

= An Autumn Greeting

WE INVITE our clientele to share some of our discoveries—
wines and spirits that have given us the joy of outstanding experi-
ences in tasting—those ultimately chosen here are worthy repre-
sentatives of their class—honest values—and, in many instances
—sensational bargains. We can think of no pleasanter way to
greet the advent of Autumn than to alert you, in these pages, to

some of our “favorites”—those bottles in our century-old cellars

that we consider particularly notable.
