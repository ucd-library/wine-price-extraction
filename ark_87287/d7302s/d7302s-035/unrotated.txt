The commune of Vosne Romanee produces more great wines than any other in
Burgundy, and yet its great vineyards total not more than 150 acres. The wines are
the most expensive, and wine lovers seek them out. The vineyard names of this small
town reads like a Who’s Who—Romanee Conti, La Tache, Richebourg, Romanee
St. Vivant and la Romanee. In a good year, hardly more than 300 cases are pro-
duced in total. We proudly offer below, in limited quantity, its noble product in all
