ALSATIAN WINES...
397 SYLVANER 1959 (Caves Hanhhart) 0.0.0.0... 1.29 14.50

Here is a typical Alsatian wine made from the Sylvaner grape—fresh, young, exceptionally
light and delightful.

409 RIESLING 1959 (Caves Hanhart) 1.69 18.50
The Riesling grape particularly thrives among the steep hills of Alsace and literally
flourished, both qualitatively and quantitatively in 1959. Dry, fresh, charming. Half

bottles at 94¢ each, 20.50 the case.

GEWURZTRAMINER 1959 (Caves Hanhart) ... 1.99 22.65
The most highly regarded grape of the district is the Gewurztraminer which yields a wine
not quite as dry as the Riesling, but with a bouquet that is more prominent and more
highly perfumed. This wine would be an exceptional value at 2.25.

RIESLING, RESERVE EXCEPTIONELLE.
ee 2.49 27.95
Estate bottled, by grower J. Willmann, a proud owner who owns some of the best
wine land in Alsace and bottles wine only from his own vineyards. This ‘“‘Reserve” js
the finest product of his best barrel of Riesling. It is head and shoulders above the
average Alsatian wine. Unlike his more land-locked neighbors, Mr. Willmann spends
a good portion of his time here in New England and therefore has a very personal reason
to make certain that his best wines reach the United States.

GEWURZTRAMINER, CLOSGEISPEL, 1959 2.99 34.75
It is not usual, or easy, to get an estate bottling from a single vineyard in Alsace.
However, Mr. Willmann does own one of the great vineyards of this area “‘Clos Seispel”
and every bit of this Grande Reserve Execptionnelle Gewurztraminer can trace its
noble origin to this choice bit of Alsatian soil. It is the best crop of Alsace, the greatest
year, and perhaps the best single piece of land. Alsatian wine at its most remarkable—
unusual depth, finesse and stature.

GEWURZTRAMINER 1959 (F. Hugel) 3.29 35.75

Mr. Hugel is considered the Dean of the Alsatian wine growers. His 1959 is one
of the best wines he has ever made. This Grand Cru Gewurztraminer is only now
arriving to bring its distinction to your fall and winter entertaining.

434 NEUCHATEL 1959 (Bouvier Freres) _ 1.49 16.95

Dry, delightful, delicate, sprightly, and one of the most popular of white wines for
summer drinking. Estate bottled by one of the best growers of Switzerland.

NEUCHATEL 1959 (City of Neuchatel) 1.79 19.95

We recently slept in the charming town of Neuchatel, met the mayor who showed us
the vineyards which are the property of the City itself. The vineyard is tendered with

loving care by the townspeople. If there is a better Neuchatel in Switzerland, we have
not yet found it.
