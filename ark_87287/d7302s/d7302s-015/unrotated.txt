AN AMAZING EVENT HAS TAKEN PLACE-—it is now possible to buy many famed
Chateau-bottled Clarets, in New York, on a consumer level, at lower prices than those
that prevail today on the Bordeaux market! Because of the scarcity of great wine in
Bordeaux, and the increase in demand throughout the world, the current quotations for
many Clarets have reached astronomical levels. Barring a change in world economy, we
Ho not anticipate that they will come down. Our prices below are based on our acquisition
cost and not on replacement, which is much higher. Our advice is to acquire those

Clarets now, while available at these low levels.
