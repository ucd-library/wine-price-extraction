Impeccable examples of
estate-bottled and Chateau-
bottled thoroughbreds from
the great vineyards of France
and Germany. Based on pres-
ent replacement, each would
have to sell at considerably
higher levels.

HERMITAGE, LES MOINES, 1953

After much comparative tasting, we are convinced that “Les
Moines”’ is the best single example of Rhone Valley red wine
we have yet run across.

CHATEAU VIEUX CERTAN 1953

Because of the great frost damage that took place in the Pomerol
district, these wines are particularly sought-after and have gone
up astronomically in cost. Here is an exceptional example.

CHATEAU LA GAFFELIERE NAUDES
1953

A truly great St. Emilion—like Chateau Petrus in Pomerol, this
wine is much sought-after by Bordeaux wine lovers.

STILL CHAMPAGNE,
BLANCS DE BLANC, 1955

This marks the first importation in over a decade of the still
wine grown in the Champagne district of France. Exceedingly
light, delicate, and particularly interesting to the wine con
noisseur. Very popular in France.

SANCERRE 1955 (Loire Valley )
Only 25 cases reached us and we offer them proudly. Here is
one of the best examples of Loire we have ever tasted.

NIERSTEINER HEILEGENBAUM
SPATLESE 1955 Estate Bottled, Reinhold Senfter
if you have not tried any 1955 Rhine wines, we know of no
better introduction than this outstanding Niersteiner produced
and bottled by Senfter, one of the best growers of the area.

Presenting two fine 1953
Estate-bottled Red Burgun-
dies, a glorious Meursault, and
two interesting white wines
from Alsace and the Loire.

VOLNAY, POUSSE D’OR, 1953
A fine Volnay—full of fruit, flavor and power—Estate-bottled
by Chavigne & Lavorielle.

BEAUNE, LES CRAS, 1953

One of our most popular red Burgundies. Estate bottled by
Duvault-Blochet.

CHATEAU FIGEAC 1953 (St. Emilion)

Knowing Claret experts consider Figeac one of the best wines
of the St. Emilion district—almost in a class with Ausone and
Cheval Blanc.

MEURSAULT GENEVRIERES 1953
Estate Bottled, Michelet

Our recent trip to Burgundy taught us one thing—a good Meur-
sault Genevrieres can compete with a top flight Montrachet.
This outstanding example proves it beyond question.

GEWURZTRAMINER, GRAND CRU, 1953,
F. Hugel

Here is a great example of Alsatian white wine that can compete
seriously with some of the best vineyards of the Rhine.

POUILLY BLANC FUME 1955, Marchand

We have never tasted a better example of Pouilly Blanc Fume,
nor do we think it exists anywhere in the Loire. An amazing
wine.

Three thoroughbreds from the
golden slopes of Burgundy —
the Chassagne Montrachet is
one of the best expressions of
white Burgundy we have en-
countered in years.

BEAUNE, CLOS DES MOUCHES, 1953
Estate Bottled, Duvault-Bochet

Clos des Mouches has become an absolute favorite among many
discriminating wine drinkers of New York. This is the best one
we have ever tasted and there are half bottles at $1.69 each

CHASSAGNE MONTRACHET,
RUCHOTTES, 1952

Estate Bottled, Claude Ramonet

The 1952 white Burgundies were fabulous rarely have we ex-

perienced quite the harmony of body, subtlety and bouquet
achieved by this one.

MEURSAULT CHARMES 1953

Estate Botiled, Joseph Matrot

Somewhat softer and a bit less powerful than the Montrachets
Matrot is admired throughout Burgundy for the top flight qual
ity of his Meursault.

The glories of Burgundy are
well represented here. These
are hard to come by and rep-
resent the best vinicultural ef-
forts of the owner-growers of
this district.

CLOS VOUGEOT 1952
Estate Bottled, Gouroux

A classic red Burgundy from the largest and most famous of all
of the Burgundian vineyards.

VOSNE ROMANEE, BEAUMONT, 1953
Estate Bottled, Noillet

A Burgundian treasure that will compete with the greatest giants
of all. Magnificent today, it also has a brilliant future.

BONNE MARES 1953
Estate Bottled, Clair-Dau

In England, this is the most sought-after of all the red wine of
Burgundy. A dramatic wine experience.

BEAUNE, LES CRAS, 1947

Estate Bottled, Duvault-Blochet

Some of the most glorious wine of our generation was produced
during the 1947 vintage on the Cotes du Beaune. We proudly

announce the acquisition of this extraordinary 1947. It will soon
be gone so we urge that you order quickly.

ALOXE CORTON 1937
Estate Bottled, Doudet-Naudin

Many of you are familiar with the treasures of Naudin’s pre-war
cellar which we told you about a year ago. Here is one of the
great 1937s that was a worthy occupant of the ‘forgotten cellar’
that was sealed back in 1942 and not opened until 1955.

CLOS BLANC DE VOUGEOT 1953
Estate Bottled, L’Heretier-Guyot

An extraordinary example of white Burgundy froin the famed
Clos Vougeot vineyard. Exceptional breed and class.
