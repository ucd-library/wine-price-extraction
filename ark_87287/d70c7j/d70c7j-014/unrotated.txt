No Bon Voyage gift can be more appre-
ciated, or be better timed, than iced
Champagne delivered in the gay,
spirited “Le Can-Can.” — delivered at
the moment when it is most needed —
when friends are gathered in the state-
room ready to lift their glasses in a fare-
well toast.

Not only is this gift imaginative, gay
and symbolic, but it need not even be
very costly. Simply pick your favorite
Champagne below (whether it be one,
three, or a dozen bottles ) and add only
$2.95 additional to the cost of “Le Can-

Can,

“Te Can-Can” has many after uses for the
boat traveler — as an extra carry-all; a
wine-cooler in the stateroom, etc.

And, should you be sailing yourself, do
not overlook ordering several bottles of
Champagne iced in ‘Le Can-Can” for
your own Bon Voyage party, — it is de-
livered to the stateroom before sailing
time: there is no anxious waiting for the
wine to get cold, and the farewell party
can begin the moment the first well-wisher
arrives.
