LOIRE VALLEY WINES... Bottle Case

566 MUSCADET 1957 (Claude Carrier) . . . 1.29 14.50

The delicate dry white wines of the Loire Valley are becoming increasingly
popular throughout the world. One of the most delightful is “Muscadet”
which is produced not far from the town of Nantes. Here it is in all its
fresh dry delicacy—sheer perfection for summer drinking—at the unbe-
lievably low price of only $1.29 the bottle.

393 ANJOU, BLANC DE BLANC, 1953 (M. Rouff).. 1.49 16.95

A most pleasing dry white wine—approximates in taste, color and brittle
dry delicacy, the still non-sparkling Champagnes that were so popular
before the war, but are no longer exported.

567 MUSCADET 1957 (Clos des Orfeuilles). . . . 1.89 20.95

A disasterous frost struck the Loire Valley in May 1957 and in many
areas no wine at all was harvested. However, though the crop was frac-
tional, the wine was outstanding. We acquired the entire remaining stock
of this remarkable Muscadet, from the best vineyard in the district. Dry,
light, delicate. Half bottles at $1.05 each, $22.95 the case of 24.

408 VOUVRAY 1955 (Estate of J. Bruly). . . . 1.98 22.00

Now that Spring is here, the cry of ‘““Ouvrez le Vouvray” fills the air more
frequently. Made from the Chenin Blanc grape around the village of
Vouvray just east of “Tours”, it has been a continuous favorite among
Americans.

490 QUINCY 1955 (Gaston Lapha) . . . . 219 24.795

Just north of Bourges, there is the little town of Quincy which has only
550 acres under wine cultivation. Because of low production, it is hard
to come by. The most pronounced features are its highly perfumed bouquet
and unusual finesse.

367 POUILLY BLANC FUME 1955 (J. Papiot). . . 2.19 24.75

The world demand for Pouilly Fumé now is in great excess of the supply
and authentic examples of this wine are now rationed and hard to come
by. Its popularity started a few years ago in the restaurants of Paris and
has now spread throughout the globe. Unusual lightness, delicacy and
bouquet. This wine generally sells for over $3.00 the bottle.

578 SANCERRE 1957 (Domaine Mellot) . . . . 2.20 25.75

Like Pouilly Fumé across the Loire River, the Sancerre district produces
extraordinary dry white wine of captivating delicacy and subtlety. Here is
a young, glorious 1957 that is truly one of the great white wines of the Loire.

        
 
   
       
       
       
               

SWISS WHITE WINES...

474 SWISS NEUCHATEL (Ville de Neuchatel) . 1.29 14.50
Here is a young, fresh Neuchatel, Estate bottled by the City of Neuchatel.
For warm weather drinking, it has consistently been one of the most delight-
ful, delicate, sprightly and popular of the white wines. Surpasses most
Neuchatel on the market that sells for over $2.00 the bottle.

462 FENDANT SPATLESE 1955 (Bishop de Sion) . . 1.69 13.50
A discovery! one of the most highly regarded dry white wines of Switzer-
land ‘from a vineyard in Valais owned for centuries by the Bishops of
Sion. Time stripped the Bishops of Valais of their temporal rights, but
their vineyard properties were respected. A wine of breed and charm.
