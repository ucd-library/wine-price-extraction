Oysters and White Wine:- Try a half dozen ora dozen
oysters freshly opened and serve with merely a little
lemon juice (please no cocktail sauce) and perhaps some
thin slices of dark bread and sweet butter. This seafood
delicacy rises to new heights when it is joined with Kriss
Alsatian Riesling 1945 ($1.79 the bottle). The Alsatian
wine growers must have had oysters in mind when they
planted the Riesling grapes which produced this wine.

Diner a deux:- Want an exciting dinner for two? First of
all, put one or two (dependent upon your wine drinking
capacity and whether it is to be a long chatty evening) of
1945 Meursault Perrieres on the ice (this favorite white
wine of mine sells for $2.79 the fifth). Start off with some
excellent Little Neck clams with lemon and some toasted
rye bread with butter (you will enjoy the Meursault with the
clams). Follow with a chicken sauteed with herbs and white
wine. Here is the recipe - cut up a two pound broiler. Melt
four tablespoons of butter in a skillet and brown chicken
nicely on all sides, salting it while it is cooking. When
brown - this should take about eight to ten minutes - add
two ounces of the white wine, Cover and turn the heat low.
Let it simmer for about eight to ten minutes. Remove the
cover and add two tablespoons each of chopped parsley,
chives, and either chervil or chopped watercress. Add an-
other two ounces of the wine. Turn the pieces of chicken _
so that they all get a coating of the herbs and let the chicken
cook for four or five minutes. Remove the chicken, add
another piece of butter to the sauce and let it cook for a

minute and pour it over the chicken. The rest of your dinner

can be some broccoli with browned butter, a green salad and
some peaches poached in syrup and served with a little Cog-
nac for the conversation piece that always follows a good

dinner. Need I repeat - Meursault Perrieres from the clams

to the salad?

All this talk of food and wine amidst Fall breezes and gentle
rustling of leaves reminds us that the game season is close
at hand. The dinner of game provides a perfect opportunity
to put your best wines to the test; for nothing calls for great
wine as much as beautifully prepared game. (My favorite
wines on this occasion are any of the great red wines

from the Domaine de la Romanee Conti, Clos de

Vougeot 1943, Chateau Haut Brion 1937, or a good
Chateauneuf du Pape).
