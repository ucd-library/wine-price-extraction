Do not deny yourself the pleasure of really great white wines simply
because the names they bear seem discouragingly long and complicated.
Once you learn the formula of reading Rhine and Moselle labels, -you
will find them the most informative of all. With few exceptions, all of
these wines are named after the town from which they come (a Hoch-

°

heimer is from Hochheim and a Niersteiner is from Nierstein). If a
particular town has a superior vineyard, the vineyard name will follow
the town name (as in 8M — Hochheimer Kirchenstuck). The wines carry-
ing a vineyard name are, of course, superior to those that do not.

Even among the good Rhines and Moselles that bear a vineyard name,
there are further variations. When the grapes are picked late you get a
better wine and this is called ‘Spatlese’ (as in 46M — Piesporter Laychen
Spatlese). When a wine is made from a carefully selected bunch of late
picked grapes, it is called ‘Auslese’ (as in 38M — Kaseler Hitzlay
Auslese). The term ‘Beerenauslese’ indicates the highest type of excellence
and possesses the most luxuriant bouquet and richness (as in 24M). All
these wine names are followed by a vintage. The years to look for here
are °37, ’42, 43, °45, 46 and soon there will be 47. A wine bearing the
description “Cabinet” indicates a superior and carefully selected “cuvee.

Most of the great Rhine and Moselle wines are estate bottled. The. most
common terms describing this superior type of bottling are: original—
abfullung or estate-bottled, and wachstum or growth. Unless one of these
terms appear, the wine is a regional or shipper’s wine, but nevertheless,
can be good if carefully selected.
