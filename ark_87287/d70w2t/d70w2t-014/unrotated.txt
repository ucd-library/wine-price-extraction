in time to bestow its delight. ‘Here is the disarming country white wine of France at its best—delightful

 

bouquet, charming freshness, easy drinkability—certainly one of the best Muscadets I have ever tasted,”
states our associate, James Beard, after tasting the Muscadet, Cuvee Beauregard, 1967. We urge that you

try it.

Sur-Lie simply means that the wine was not racked, but taken out of the barre] from the top by
ladle. This is a slower, more costly process, with more waste, but the result is a richer and fuller
Muscadet. We urge that you try this one.
