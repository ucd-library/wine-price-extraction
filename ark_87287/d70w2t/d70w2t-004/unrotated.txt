Great, great wines in the classic tradition—brilliant, very long future. Probably the best vintage since 1945.
Highly concentrated wines, rich in every element, yet in harmonious balance. The prices have soared astro-
nomically in Bordeaux for these great wines as they become scarcer and scarcer. Ultimately, they will
command a higher price than the 59s. Now is the time to buy them.

Astonishingly great example of Pomerol. Very similar in character to the greatest Pomerol of
them all, Chateau Petrus. Price superb for a deep, full 1961 of this calibre and heritage. Will grow
in stature for another decade.

gay CATH AUW PELAIR St ballion)c. 2 i es a ee 4.49 48.50
Owned by Chateau Ausone and matured in the Ausone cellars. Many claim that even the best
tasters cannot distinguish Belair and Ausone. Since Chateau Ausone commands well over $100
the case, this is obviously outstanding value.

1960 RED BORDEAUX

1960 was surely neglected because it was squeezed between the much acclaimed ’59s and ’61s. With the
passage of time, the basic, well above average merit of the ’60s have become recognized. They are not
designed for laying away, but for present joyous drinking. Relatively light and well balanced. Note the

pleasantly low prices.

A traditionally full bodied vineyard like Cos d’Estournel faired well in 1960, a relatively light
year. Good balance was achieved.

The happy harmony of elegance and lightness is astonishing here. Noble finesse at modest cost.
Available in half bottles at 3.14 each, 67.70 the case.

1959 RED BORDEAUX

Hailed the ‘Vintage of the Century.” Original high rating now being proven by true balance, fine bouquet
and exceptional character. Practically unprocurable in Bordeaux today, scarcity being reflected by tre-
mendous jumps in market prices during recent months. Now, not next Fall, is the time to acquire your 1959s.

the same kind of great character.
