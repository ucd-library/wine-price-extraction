They have delighted Parisians for dec-
ades... and now they are here to bring
their excellence and wonderfully low
cost to the wine drinkers of New York.

The range of their wines vary from a 1967 Beaujolais to an 1869 Lafite
Rothschild. Nicolas employs 30 wine buyers, whose sole job it is to travel
continuously to the various vineyards, sample, taste, and then decide. All
of the wines shown on these two pages have been carefully tasted by us
and we can recommend them as outstanding wines within their price class.
We urge that you try them.
