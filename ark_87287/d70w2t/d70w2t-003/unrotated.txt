1963 RED BORDEAUX

Not an outstanding year, but some good wines produced. We rejected most of them and list below three
survivors of our tasting panel.

258 CHATEAU DUCRU BEAUCAILLOU (St. Julien). Surprisingly good ............ 2.49 26.90
5035 CHATEAU LAFITE ROTHSCHILD (Pauillac). Very light, elegant .............. 4.49 48.50
634 CHATEAU LATOUR (Pauillac). Good body, well balanced ..................... 4.49 48.50

1962 RED BORDEAUX

The 1962 vintage has never enjoyed the drum beating and frenzied publicity of the ‘59s, ’61s or ‘64s. But,
like a Cinderella tale, they have something important to offer the wine drinker of today. Because of their
relatively early maturing, they are absolutely delightful for present drinking with at least five good years
ahead. Their cost has gone up substantially in Bordeaux during the recent months as the ‘59s and ’61s
become scarcer and more expensive.

521 CHATEAU BELLEVUE (Bordeaux Superieur). Excellent—great value ............ 1.69 18.25
529 CHATEAU COUTELIN MERVILLE (St. Estephe). Soft, distinguished bouquet ... 1.99 21.50
522 Fe AT ICUOG) os i a oe hb eae Vie stews be tales 1.99 21.50

In a blind tasting, the Air France panel selected this particular wine to be served on their Euro-
pean flights. Surprising character for such relatively modest cost.
598 i oo as awh a 8h sili Hae ERNE 2.99 32.30
Glowing, dark ruby color, typical of Pomerols. Velvety gras, coupling depth and finesse. Recom-
mended strongly. Available in half bottles at 1.64 each, 35.30 the case.

Commands higher price than the Medoc 1st Growths on the Bordeaux market today. Readier to
drink than Chateau Margaux, Mouton or Haut Brion.

A remarkable vineyard owned by the Dillon Family and lovingly cared for by Seymour Weller.
Has more depth and power than any of the other 1st Growths of 1962.

99.75 the case.
