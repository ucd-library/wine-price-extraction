This gay, light-bodied red wine makes no more pretension to greatness than a cheerful little vin du pays of France.
Like these, it is fresh, clean and satisfying. It is a wine such as may be found in many French country inns’ cellars;
usually without either a label or a date, but nonetheless, good. Our St. Michel Rouge comes from the hillsides which
provide some of the finest vineyard land in California. A pleasant all-purpose red table wine. Also available in half
bottles at 54c each, $12.95 the case.

ST. MICHEL MT. BLANC (California) . . . . . Continued 97

The dry white wine counterpart of the St. Michel Rouge. Also available in half bottles.

BOORDY VINEYARD ROSE (Maryland) . . . . . ania 1.45 15.95

We cannot refrain from including this charming Rosé among our offerings because we think it will make an interest-
ing contribution to your summer living. The vineyard is not in California, nor in France, but just outside of Balti-
more, and yet it produces a pink wine that can hold its head high with almost any ‘Vin Rose.’ It started as a hobby
by Philip Wagner, the editor of the Baltimore Sun, and his wife, Jocelyn, and pretty soon they were saying ‘its bigger
than both of us.’ Now it is a commercial enterprise, though a small one, and the wine is much more than a conver-
sation piece, but an honestly made wine that will delight the fancier of Vin Rosé. Incidentally, there is also an ex-
cellent dry white wine from Boordy vineyard at the same price.

Those who seek a ‘Richebourg’ within the borders of the United States must look to Martin Ray’s vineyard high in
the Santa Cruz mountains of California. The price, for an American product, is astonishingly high, but is worth
it for those who want to experience the great heights that can be achieved by California’s closest counterpart to a
great bottle of red Burgandy.
