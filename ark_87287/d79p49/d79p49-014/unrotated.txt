White Burgundies

PINOT CHARDONNAY "LAMARTINE" 1959

A delightful white Burgundy made of the noble Pinot Chardonnay grape.
Unique opportunity to drink wine of character at irresistibly low cost.

BEAUJOLAIS BLANC 1960

Estate bottled, Plumet

Green-gold in color, rivals its neighbor, Pouilly Fuisse - outstanding value.

POUILLY FUISSE 1960
Estate bottled, Plumet
Mr. Plumet owns some of the best vineyard land of the district. This 1960
is extremely pale in color, with remarkable bouquet and breed.

POUILLY FUISSE, CLOS REISSIER, 1961
Estate bottled, Mathias

Young, fresh, typical of a good estate bottled Pouilly.

CHABLIS VAULORENT 1960
Estate bottled, Domaine Maladiere

Here we are dealing with a superb example of Chablis = crisp, bone-dry
and typical.

MEURSAULT PERRIERES 1959
Estate bottled, Ampeau
A fabulous 1959 Meursault from one of the noblest vineyards of the town.
Exceptional.

PULIGNY MONTRACHET, LES COMBETTES, 1959
Estate bottled, Ampeau
The greatest dry white wines of France are produced in this township. Here
is an impeccable example from one of the better vineyards produced by the
master grower, M. Ampeau.

BEAU NE, CLOS DES MOUCHES, 1959
Estate bottled, Joseph Drouhin
Produced in limited quantities ~ much sought after by those who prefer
lightness, balanced by austerity. A thoroughbred.

BATARD MONTRACHET 1960
Estate bottled, J. Monnot ne
In our opinion, this great wine from the cellars of Monnot is quite the equal

of the best in Montrachet.

CORTON CHARLEMAGNE 1959

Estate bottled, Joseph Drouhin
Here jis a Sing that is in the same class as Montrachet itself. Produced on

the steep hillsides of Corton, this 1959 promises many years of greatness.
