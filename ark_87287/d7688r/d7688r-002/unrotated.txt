Estate Bottled, A. Establet (AS PURVEYED TO THE HOLY SEE)
It was in the town of Chateauneuf du Pape, amidst its vineyards, where the French Popes established their residences during
the middle ages. It is historically interesting to note that this particular wine which bears on its label “as purveyed to the Holy
See” is being shipped to the wine cellars of the Papacy, even today.

342 HERMITAGE ROUGE, SIZERANNE, 1937 (Estate Bottled, M. Chapoutier) 2.78 30.00
George Saintsbury called Hermitage the manliest of all red wines — taste this fully matured 1937 and you will see why Hermit-
age sometimes ranked as the greatest of the less known red wines of France. Here is a unique opportunity to acquire a 1937
Estate Bottled red wine of great depth and bouquet.

449 MUSCADET 1953 (Estate Bottled, Chateau de la Bidiere) . . . . . L49 16.95
The popularity of the dry, delicate white wines of the Loire Valley has grown tremendously in recent years. Many of us now know
the “Pouilly Fumé” and “Sancerre”. We strongly urge that you now try the “Muscadet”, particularly of the superb 1953 vintage.
Bottle Case
402 POUILLY BLANC FUME 1953 (Estate Bottled, Saget) . . . 2.49 27.95
Perhaps the most sought after dry white wine of France today is the “Pouilly Fumé”. The wine has now a devoted world follow-
ing who particularly proclaim the heights achieved during the 1953 vintage. The fresh, fruity virtues of youth are clearly demon-
strated here.
