RED WINES
253 BEAUJOLAIS 1955, Domaine du Ringuet

Our best-seller among our red wines and for good reason
—we quote the review this wine received in the New
York Times, January 29th, “‘then there is a Beaujolais that
is all a Beaujolais should be, but alas, seldom in this
country — purplish-red, with the fruity aroma and taste
of crushed grapes. In our opinion, a true discovery for
those who want true Beaujolais at a modest price.”

150 CHATEAU VERDIGNAN 1952

From the Haut Medoc of Bordeaux comes this distin-
guished Chateau bottled Claret. A real beauty.

One of the most popular of the delicate, dry white wincs
of the Loire Valley.

454 ALSATIAN RIESLING 1955, Hanhart

From the steep hills of Alsace comes this young, fresh,
dry white wine. Rich with charm and bouquet.

ness and softness with a trace of earthy taste.

there.

tle. We know of no more pleas-
ing examples available than the
red and white Bordeaux of Boyer
Freres.

RED WINES

depletion and frost damage.

colorful, wicker bottle at a cost of only 3¢ the fluid ounce.

WHITE WINE
