RED WINES

CHATEAU LASCOMBES 1953

In the town of Margaux there is the Chateau Lascombes
vineyard owned by a group of promiment Americans. At
a recent blind-tasting held in Bordeaux, this wine held
its own with the grand First Growths. Remarkable.

178 CHATEAU CALON SEGUR 1953

The reputation of this Chateau, located in St. Estephe, has
grown at a most dramatic rate since the war. An excellent
1953.

651 CHASSAGNE MONTRACHET,
BOUDRIOTTES, 1953
Estate Bottled, Claude Ramonet
Though Chassagne Montrachet is better known for its
white wine than its red, some extraordinary red Bur-

gundy is produced here. This one is an absolute beauty,
full of fruit and the most extraordinary bouquet.

271 CHATEAU BEYCHEVILLE 1953
Beycheville commands a higher price on the Bordeaux
market than any other Claret other than the grand First
Growths. It fared outstandingly well during the great
1953 vintage.

203 MOREY, CLOS DE LA ROCHE, 1952
Estate Botiled, J. H. Remy

Another prime example of great Cote de Nuits.
