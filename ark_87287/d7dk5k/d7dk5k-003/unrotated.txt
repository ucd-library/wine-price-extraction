SHERRY WINE & SPIRIT CO., INC. - 679 MADISON AVENUE, N.Y. -

Frost has hit Bordeaux for two consecutive years. The

results have been extremely high prices, and great
difficulty in persuading the owners to part with their OW
better Clarets. [t is therefore no ordinary wine event

to obtain distinguished Clarets such as these below $2
the bottle — a sale opportunity only made possible
by the fact that these wines were acquired by us
nearly two years ago. Consistent with our policy, the
savings are being passed on to you.
