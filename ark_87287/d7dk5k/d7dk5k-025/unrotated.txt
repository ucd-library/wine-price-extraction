RED WINES

266 BEAUNE, CUVEE DAMES
HOSPITALIERES, 1947

Hospices de Beaune

Acquired at the annual Hospices de Beaune auction dur-
ing November following the vintage. A rare 1947 that
is no lenger commercially available.

277 MAZIS CHAMBERTIN 1949
Estate Bottled, Jules Regnier

The tiny Mazis Chambertin vineyard is one of the best
of the Chambertin area. Here is a remarkable 1949 selected
proudly by the jury of the Confrerie des Chevaliers du
Tastevin. Authentic 1949s such as this, have almost dis-
appeared from the wine market.

WHITE WINE

264 GRAND MONTRACHET 1955
Estate Bottled, Thevenin

The ‘ne plus ultra’ of all French white wines is Le Mont-
rachet itself — an absolute maximum of 2000 cases a
year is produced by this single 18 acre plot owned by a
dozen proprietors. A glorious, much sought-after 1955.

MOSELLE WINES

569 BRAUNEBERGER JUFFER AUSLESE
1953, von Schorlemer

During the 19th Century, Brauneberg was the most cele-
brated of the Moselles. Now, not quite as popular, it still
ranks with the greatest of the vineyards.

970 LIESERER NIEDERBERG HELDEN
FEINE AUSLESE 1953, von Schorlemer

The name of von Schorlemer on the label automatically
results in a great Moselle. A ‘“‘Feine Auslese 1953” puts
it among the giants.

996 WEHLENER SONNENUHR AUSLESE
1953 Estate Bottled, Johann Josef Prum

A glorious Moselle from Prum with a bouquet and flavor
that is nothing short of astonishing.

Estate Bottled, Egon Muller

SPATLESE 1955,

Estate Bottled, Ehses-Decker
This wine represents one of the highlights of our Spring
tasting trip through the Moselle. If any doubt at all exists
as to the quality that can be achieved among the 1955
in the Moselle, tasting this thoroughbred would remove
it completely.

 

   

568 SCHARZHOFBERGER 1955

  
  

The Scharzhof is a fine old manor house owned for gen-
erations by the Muller family. Superb Saar wine
of the great dry white wines of.the world.

609 ZELTINGER HIMMELREICH

The glories of Burgundy, the
Rhine and Moselle are well rep-
resented here. Each of these is
an Estate bottled jewel, hard to
come by, and represent top flight
vinicultural efforts.

RED WINES

663 GEVREY-CHAMBERTIN VAROILLES
1953, Estate Bottled, Deschamps

From a small 15 acre vineyard rated as the ‘Premier
Cuvee’”’ of Gevrey.

664 CHARMES CHAMBERTIN 1953

Estate Bottled, Richard
The Charmes vineyard is rated only slightly below Cham-
bertin itself. Great depth, bouquet and balance.

234 VOSNE ROMANEE, SUCHOTS, 1953,
Estate Bottled, Noirot

Bounded on one side by Richebourg, this classic wine has
the same distinction as its illustrious neighbor.

169 VOLNAY, CLOS DE FREMIET 1953

Estate Bottled, Marquis d’Angerville
Marquis d’Angerville is the dean of this important wine
producing town.

282 POMMARD EPENOTS 1953
Estate Bottled, Parent

Pommard is the best known of all Burgundies and Epenots
is the best vineyard. Here is an Estate bottled thorough-
bred that represents Pommard at its best — a far-cry from
the dubious Pommards that flood the market.

207 NUITS ST. GEORGES ARGILLIERES
1953, Estate Bottled, General Gouachon

Monsieur Gouachon, a retired French Army General, is
the proud producer of this extraordinary fine 1953 Nuits
St. Georges.

WHITE WINES

665 BATARD MONTRACHET 1955

Estate Bottled, J. Bavard
Though quite in a class with Montrachet itself, the Batard
is not quite as fabulously expensive. A beautiful 1955.

322 CHABLIS, BOUGROS, 1953

Estate Bottled, Servin
Lovers of fine Chablis should not overlook this one —

one of the best examples of great Chablis we have ever
tasted.

RHINE WINES
643 STEINBERGER CABINET 1953

Estate Bottled, Staatsweingut
A collector’s item. One of the most glorious Rheingaus
produced during our generation.

961 MARCOBRUNNER SPATLESE 1953

Estate Bottled, Langwerth von Simmern
Che greatest treasure of the town of Erbach is the Marco-

brunn vineyard, regarded by many as the finest of Ger-
many. Glorious.

3043 SCHLOSS JOHANNISBERGER
CABINET 1953
Estate Bottled, Prince von Metternich
One of the great vineyards of all the world is Schloss

Johannisberg. Their better wines carry the added descrip-
tion of “Cabinet.” Here is a rare 1953.
