Domaine Clos Des Orfeuilles

In January, an important wine event tuok place at the Orfeuilles Vineyard—the
historic 1959 Vintage was being put into bottle—a scant four months after the
grapes were gathered. Six bottles were flown to New York to be appraised by
our Tasting Committee. We report that what we found lived up to the glowing
accounts that preceded the wine. Among those who tasted was our associate
James Beard who commented: *‘Here is the country white wine of France at its
best—delightful bouquet, charming freshness, pleasantly dry, easy drinkability
—the best Muscadet I have ever tasted.’’ Comfortably resting in our cellars is
the first shipment of the 1959s to reach the United States—ready to contribute
its delightful qualities to the wine lovers of New York-—and at pleasantly low
cost.

A RARE

YEAR
OLD

The notorious cry of “Howdy Reb” or “Hello
Johnny” across the Civil War battle lines backgrounds
the name of Johnny Reb. This outstanding Kentucky
Bourbon—a collector’s item—embodies all the rich
flavor, delicacy, bouquet and soft mellowness of the
great, almost forgotten pre-prohibition whiskies.
Available in small quantities to those seeking the
finest Bourbon on the market. Kentucky Bourbon
of this age and perfection generally sells for $9.00
