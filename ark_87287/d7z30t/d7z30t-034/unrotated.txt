1296 COL COURBE V.S.E.P. ‘Crooked Neck) . 5.99 5.19 59.95

Col Courbé, in its interesting crooked neck bottle, is a fine Brandy with the delicacy and aromatic bouquet that can
only be achieved by a well made Cognac. A unique Cognac value.

1225 FORTNUM & MASON’S FINE COGNAC. _ 7.50 6.99 80.00

This interesting example of dry, English Market Cognac is particularly relished by Cognac connoisseurs. Great

Britain is a nation that takes its Brandy very seriously. Aware of this, the 250 Year Old firm of Fortnum & Mason

— acquired some of the best and oldest stocks of Cognac to meet the uncompromising demands of knowing
ondoners.

1901: MARC DE: BOURCOGKE ==... we 8.99 102.00

From the grape pressings of Le Montrachet, the greatest white wine vineyard of all Burgundy, comes this full-bodied,
intriguing and remarkable Brandy. It is the proud product of Julien Monnot, a small but distinguished grower, who
owns some of the best land in the Montrachet vineyard. Brandy of this type is normally distilled only in the smallest
of quantities for private use and is hard to come by. However, we did manage to persuade M. Monnot to part with a
few of his precious bottles—a rare brandy that captures the essence of one of Burgundy’s greatest vineyards.

1297 SINGLE CASK UNBLENDED (1929 Vintage) 9.98 9.45 108.00

Here is an Estate-bottled Cognac that was produced during a great vintage year (1929) in the most celebrated
part of the Cognac country, “Grand Fine Champagne”. It has remained in its unblended state in barrels from 1929
until the present date. Cognac of this calibre is difficult to obtain because no more than a few small growers have
the patience and aptitude to put aside, year after year, a distillation of their outstanding vintages.

1301 HINE FAMILY RESERVE ........ 24745 282.00

Part of the old family reserve of Hine — never before commercially available — the heritage is stated on the back label
which is hand signed by a director of the firm. The most magnificent of Cognacs for holiday use or gift giving.
