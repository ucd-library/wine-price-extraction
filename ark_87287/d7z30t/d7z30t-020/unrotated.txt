basket’’ — “‘gay, festive when filled
with splits’? — ‘‘best $20 gift in

town’’ —comment our clientele.

Splits of French Champagne, century-
old symbols of festivity, have long been very
popular during the Christmas-New Year
holiday season. But the question remained
for us—in what gift container to put them. It
had to be amusing, practical and modest in

cost.

‘‘Perfect,”’ we shouted when we first saw the
waste-basket pictured here. It had every-
thing we wanted—the authentic reproduc-
tion of the first issue of the New York Daily
Times is amusing and interesting—made of
sturdy steel, it is practical and useful—and

it costs but one dollar, modest enough.

Pick any of the French Champagne splits

listed below — nine is about right for a
bounteous gift and you can send them,
°

beautifully packaged, free of delivery
charge, anywhere in the City, and through-
out the United Parcel Service delivery zone
in Long Island, Westchester, and Rockland

and Orange County.

There are few $20 gifts that you can pos-
sibly find that would be as charming and as
heart-warming under the Christmas tree as

“splits in basket.”

   

nestling comfortably in the
gay, delightful metal basket shown above, they are transformed into
one of the most amusing and cheerful of Christmas gifts.
