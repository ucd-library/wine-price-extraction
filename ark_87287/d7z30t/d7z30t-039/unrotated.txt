Romanée-Conti’’, because of their scarcity
and magnificence, have always been col-
lector’s items among serious W

ers. We proudly offer two fine vintage

years of 54 and 55, both eminently suc-
cessful at the Domaine, and suggest ac-

quisition before they disappear from the

market.

RED WINES

CHATEAU PETRUS 1955

In the January following this vintage, Petrus suffered
devastating damage from frost and will not recover for
several years. Luckily 1955 reached great heights at this
vineyard and is one of the true glories of Bordeaux. Hard
to come by and worth much more.

As a wine name, Chateau d’Yquem represents the ultimate
— as Rolls-Royce and Caviar do in their respective classes.
It is a rich, full, glorious and sweet wine from Sauternes.
Normally it commands well over $7 the bottle — at this
unbelievably low cost, we urge that you acquire some for
your special dinner parties.

CORTON CHARLEMAGNE 1955
Estate Bottled, Chapuis

The white wines from the Corton Charlemagne vineyard
are among the noblest of France, hard to come by, and
can be classed with the great Montrachets.

1955 Estate Bottled, C. Ramonet

Mr. Ramonet recently satisfied his life long ambition by
acquiring a small holding in the Batard Montrachet vine-

ship. In our opnion, it is quite in the league with the best
of the Montrachets.
