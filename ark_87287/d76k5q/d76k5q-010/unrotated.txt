VIN ROSE (Pink Wine)

1049. SPRING ROSE 197202 ee 2.99 32.30
The handwritten type of label intrigues us—the color and charm
of the contents delight us. In our opinion, it will take on or
surpass any Vin Rosé you have yet experienced from Europe.
A rosé with character is particularly appropriate duing this
warm weather period.

THE WINEMAKER—RODNEY STRONG 39 For four hundred years the
Strongs made wine in the Rhine valley. After a happy career as a
dancer in Paris; actor, dancer and choreographer on Broadway,
Rodney turned to wine-making, the tradition of his family. In 1960
he moved to California to make wine, which he also considers a
form of artistic expression. In search of vineyard land, Mr. Strong
has now acquired over 5,000 prime acres in the blessed Sonoma
Valley, an area that is destined to produce some of the greatest
wines of America.
