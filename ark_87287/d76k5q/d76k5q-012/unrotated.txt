M-41 CHATEAU PAVIE (St. Emilion) .......... 64.30 72.00

In 1955, 18 vineyards of St. Emilion were classified as ‘First
Great Growths.’ These include Ausone, Cheval Blanc, Figeac
and this vineyard—Pavie. A glory in 1970.
M-16 CHATEAU RAUSAN SEGLA (Margaux). .88.20 98.00
Thomas Jefferson once wrote, ‘“Razan-Margau, this is what I
import for myself.” (Note the archaic 18th Century spelling
—nevertheless Mr. Jefferson was referring to this specific
vineyard.)
M-29A CHATEAU FIGEAC (St. Emilion)...... 111.78 124.20
Figeac is directly adjacent to Cheval Blanc and shares its depth
and greatness. Based on our tasting notes, it is at least the
equal and may even surpass it with the passage of time.
M-21 CHATEAU PICHON LALANDE

(Pautllae) ..ciccciurs ES ea 117.00 130.00
Distinguished for balance and depth of flavor. Similar in char-
acteristics to the Chateau Latour vineyard, which it surrounds
on three sides.
M-12 CHATEAU GRAND PUY LACOSTE

(Pawitiagk 365605.) Sore re ee 923.75 137-50
Classified Medoc of exceptional excellence.
M-29 CHATEAU MOUTON BARON

PHILIPPE (Pauiilse) 07s 140.94 156.60
This vineyard was formerly part of Chateau Mouton Rothschild,
and then was separated in about 1800. The proprietor is the
same—Baron Philippe de Rothschild. An excellent ‘Grand Cru’
~a bit lighter than Mouton, but of the same noble heritage and
breed.
M-20 CHATEAU LEOVILLE LASCASES

(St: Judien) 0 ols, 94g. 138.60 154.00
Now a great rarity because practically entire 1970 production
has been spoken for and no longer available for resale.
M-30A CHATEAU LA MISSION HAUT

BRION (Gravee): 6.5 i vs es 179.82 199.80
Distinguishing characteristics are balance, finesse—the superb
flavor of Graves, and longevity. A classic claret.
M-37 CHATEAU HAUT BRION (Graves)...... 315.00 350.00
Very big, full; power, combined with elegance. Undoubtedly,
the best Graves produced in 1970—in the same exalted league
as Lafite, Mouton and Latour.
M-36 CHATEAU MOUTON ROTHSCHILD

(PatilaG) 96 2060S. Be A BA 378.00 420.00
Baron Philippe de Rothschild is proud of the bigness, power
and beautiful balance of his 1970 Mouton—certainly one of the
greatest of his post-war years.
M-32. CHATEAU LATOUR (Pauillac).......... 360.00 400.00
Full-bodied, firm, but with exceptional softness in 1970. Will
live for decades.
M-31 CHATEAU PETRUS (Pomerol).......... 396.00 440.00
Because of health of Merlot grapes, Chateau Petrus 1970 may
well be the best Petrus produced in the last two decades. Only
16 acres—hard to come by. Dramatic velvetiness.
M-35 CHATEAU LAFITE ROTHSCHILD

(Pauillec) 3256 366 eo a 396.00 440.00
We have watched the Lafite 1961 and 1959 climb to the $1100
per case mark and beyond. Given another decade, the same
astronomic climb will surely happen to Lafite 1970.

1969 CHATEAU BOTTLED

Because of half a normal production, the opening prices of the
1969 were record-breaking. Some exceptional examples have
reached our shores. Here are some outstanding values from ex-
cellent vineyards of Bordeaux.

No. Bottle Case
101: CHATEAU BELLEVUE ...+:..-.-++2:+>:* 2.49 26.90
Our 1967 ran out quickly because everyone loves this wine and
came back for more. The excellent 1969 is now here. Bottled by

Eschenauer.

170 CHATEAU VIEUX ROBIN ........---:-:: 2.79 : 30.15
A low-cost Chateau-bottled ‘sleeper’ from Medoc. Delicious.
248. CHATEAU COUTELIN ....- 2544+. <s55 3.49 37.70

St. Estephe — will thrive for several more years — bottled by
Eschenauer.

240 CHATEAU HANTEILLAN .......-------: 3.49 37.70
Fine Medoc, bottled in Bordeaux by Eschenauer. This is the
very wine that was chosen in a blind competitive tasting by
AIR FRANCE to serve on their European flights.

No. Bottle Case
168. GHATEAUD GANON DE BREM ~.......... 3.49 37.70
A chateau-bottled discovery from Canon-Fronsac—‘A best buy.’
122 CHATEAU MAISON BLANCHE ......... 3.79 40.95

A Montagne-St. Emilion that has been a best seller in our shop
—and our clients come back for more and more. Suggest early
acquisition before depletion.

119°: GHATEAT. DU PARG® 3.50 3..005 52 Ve 3.79 40.95
Frederick S. Wildman made this Chateau-bottled, truly excel-
lent Haut Medoc available to us. The price is relatively low
because it was contracted for immediately after the harvest and
does not yet reflect the higher replacement cost.

244. . CHATEAU GLOS FOURTED . 4s J.i5 555 5.65 61.05
Grand Cru St. Emilion—ranks among the best eight of the area.
Worth much more.

164 _ GHATEAU LAFON-ROCHBET .... 25.5555 5.99 64.70
One of the great ‘Grand Crus’ of St. Estephe. Long-lived, superb,
ideal for laying down.

1388. GHATEAU BOUSCAUT........2...2... 6.69 72.25
We are now dealing with the first vintage produced under the
dedicated supervision of the new Managing Director, Jean Del-
mas—the man who is also Managing Director of Chateau Haut
Brion. This vintage proves clearly the up-grading that can result
from care, loving devotion, selection, and superior vinifiation.

242° GHATEAU LASCUMBES .. . suena 4.5 7.25 78.30
No ordinary event to be able to get this great Margaux at this
price.

209 GHATEAY LANGULUS 4. 4. ee 7.49 80.90

A St. Emilion that has developed an enthusiastic following
among the wine lovers of Paris, London and New York.

1968 CHATEAU BOTTLED

Likely to be overlooked as a vintage, but certainly the ’68s are
much better than the '63s and ’65s. The great vineyards listed
below, through selection and reduction of total quantity, have
been able to provide truly excellent wines and are ideally suited
for present drinking. Here are some giants of Bordeaux that can
be consumed now at a price much below the value of the in-
trinsic excellence you will experience. The Latour and Petrus
are priced here below the present replacement cost in Bordeaux.

268 CHATEAU RAUSAN SEGLA ....,,...:. 4: 3.99 43.10
Classified in 1855 as one of the best of Margaux.
128... GHATEAU GOS @ESTOURNEL 2... ..<...<. 5.99 64.70

St. Estephe. Usually, this vineyard produces wines that take a
decade to mature. In a light year such as ’68 you have a happy
harmony. Ready now.

138 CHATEAU LATOUR... =) 3. 12.50 135.00
A Pauillac giant. Latour often reaches great heights in unfash-
ionable years. ‘A best buy’ for those who want to experience
the elegance of Latour at a non-staggering price.

155 CHATEAU PETRUS 2 oi ike cts ees 12.50 135.00
Chateau Petrus—the giant of Pomerol is hard to come by and
usually commands over $30 the bottle. It was excellent in 1968
and we have a few cases available at a livable cost.

1967 CHATEAU BOTTLED

Exceptionally fine, soft, fruity, quicker to mature than 1966. It
took a while, but the current quotations in Bordeaux for ’67
now approximate those that are being quoted for ’66. If you
want superb claret for drinking during the next two or three
years, we suggest the ’67 rather than the ’66s which are slower
to mature.

432... CHATEAU DU PARG 2 og ae Ge 3.79 40.95
Chateau-bottled Medoc of distinction. Astonishing price in light
of excellence and background.

110 CHATEAU GREYSAC .........-..:0005- 3.99 43.10
Georges Hereil created the Caravelle airplane; now he is Hon-
orary Chairman of Chrysler-Europe. The same kind of dedica-
tion to uncompromising excellence is exhibited in the wine that
Mr. Hereil has produced at this excellent Medoc vineyard.

251 CHATEAU DASSAULT .........-.--+--: 4.49 48.50
A ‘Grand Cru’ St. Emilion, the proud property of Marcel Das-
sault, the creator of the Mystere and Mirage.

288 CHATEAU BOUSCAUT ...........-----: 6.69 72.25
Classified ‘Grand Cru’ Graves. Owned by a group of prominent
Americans. Its 18th Century Chateau is considered one of the
most beautiful examples of architecture in southwest France.
The proprietors invite our clientele to visit the Chateau when
next in Bordeaux.
