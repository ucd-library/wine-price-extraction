 

1971 BEAUJOLAIS

STARTING JULY 1st, the leading, best-selling 1971 Beaujolais
will command between $45 and $55 the case. This unavoidable
higher price will not be the fault of the importer, but rather
the result of the franc going from 20¢ to 24¢, higher prices at
the vineyard, and the ultimate recognition of the intrinsic ex-

cellence and longevity of the 1972 vintage in the Beaujolais
area.

It is therefore no ordinary event to be able to offer you the
excellent Marples 1971 Beaujolais at $29.05 the case; the Beau-
jolais Villages at $31.30; and the Gold Award winning Brouilly,
Chateau de La Chaize 1971 at the astonishingly low sale cost
of $39.85. If we had to buy these wines today, we would prob-
ably have to charge 50% more. Why not select from those
listed below—enjoy a substantial savings—add a special excel-
lence to your summer entertaining—and simultaneously an-
ticipate your Fall-Winter requirements.

EAUX-DE-VIE

The beloved clear white brandies of France can bring a special
quality to climax the summer dinner party, particularly when
served icy cold. The very appearance of the frosted glass will
bring delight to the eyes of the beholder. The taste captures,
in flight, the fruit of the pear, cherry, plum and wild raspberry.
One bottle will go a long way—because 1 oz. in a frosty wine

glass will bring lingering pleasure as your guests joyously im-
bibe the bouquet.

Al PEAR GRANDY @hont) 6.2. 16.96
Manguin produces pears on his island in the middle of the
Rhone River that are shipped to the three-star restaurants in
France. Each year, he reserves a small quantity for distillation,
producing the best pear brandy of Europe. Remarkable.

ie Wee fAlenen) a 18.96
South of Strasbourg can be found the exceptional orchards of
Alfred Hess, the man who distills his yellow plums to provide
this delicious alcool blanc.

Ba Simeon (stone)... 18.96
A pure distillate of macerated cherries—because of intense
flavor, one bottle will go far. From Alfred Hess.

Ay (PRAMBOUE (Mey 19.76
When the orchard is idle Hess sends his men up the Vosges

Mountains above an altitude of 1,500 feet, to gather wild rasp-

berries. The process is slow, costly and laborious. It takes 15

quarts of wild raspberries to produce a single bottle of this

glorious Framboise—the best eau-de-vie we hav

e ever experi-
enced. Quantity limited.

 

LET THIS BARREL BRING YOU
JOY THIS SUMMER
Holds 4.9 Gallons—Equal to 26 Bottles

of Fine 1971 French Red Wine
Just Turn the Spigot — Out Comes the Wine

At our summer place, we keep a barrel on a stand next to
our terrace dining table. Presto! We have a glass of good
French red wine any time our guests or family are in the
mood. The cost is not excessive because you get the equiv-
alent of 26 bottles for $76.50—and when you buy the refills,
the cost of the 26 bottles is reduced to $56.50.

How does it work? Concealed in the barrel is a sturdy 4.9
gallon polyethylene bag, which, without effecting the flavor
of the wine adversely, shrinks as the wine diminishes, so
that no excessive air can ever enter. As for the wine itself,
it is the equivalent in deliciousness, fruit and balance of
any good young Beaujolais you have ever tasted. Why not
enhance your summer by having a barrel in your kitchen,
dining room, or on your terrace?
