 

ITALIAN RED WINES

Many wine drinkers are now turning to Italy to provide good
wine at modest cost. We have taken the challenge seriously,
and have searched out the best that Italy has to offer. We par-
ticularly commend the litres and double-litres as among the
best values in good red and white wine for the money—the
Barolo, for a glorious, big red—and the Soave, for your daily
warm weather wine.

No. Bottle Case

549 LAMBRUSCO AMABILE ............._ 1.89 20.95
Grapey, rich taste, a trace of sweetness—a truly carefree, highly
popular red wine grown not far from Bologna. Emilia Vini.

684 ALPINO ROSSO (Italian SFO. ca). 1.89 20.41
Easy going, light, dry and fragrant red wine. Ideal companion
to pasta and veal. Interesting red wine, particularly if served
cool, for summer dining.

627, ROSSO DI VERONA 1971

on Weer eel 1.99 21.50
Delightful, fruity Italian red wine discovered by FRANK
SCHOONMAKER in Valpolicella country near Verona. Holds
92 ozs. more than the average bottle, thus making it a ‘best
buy.’

See VAR OMCELLA 1970 5 oa 2.39 25.80
Pleasing, ever-popular, fruity light red wine grown near Verona.
Similar to a Beaujolais. Excellent example. V. Patternella.

523  CHIANTI MONTEPALDI 1971............ 2.39 25.80
Classico Chianti proudly grown by Marchesi Corsini—that re-
markable gentleman who enjoys so much prestige among the
wine growers of Tuscany—remarkable value for a wine of this
calibre.

ee ee te ee 2.99 32.30
Grown on the high slopes of the Piedmont. Dark red, deep
in flavor, long-lived, remarkable. Marchesi Fracassi di Torre
Rossano.

1038 CHIANTI SERRISTORI 1970

(In Handsome Gigantic 59 oz. Bottle)... 3.69 20.95
Attention should be paid here! Here is a gay, generous, gigantic
bottle, equal to about two and a half regular bottles, that comes
out about 6¢ per gunce! Hardly more than beer! The wine
is not just good, but comes from the cellars of Conti Serristori,
one of the most respected growers of Tuscany. The heritage is
impeccable—it was selected for us by Frank Schoonmaker and
the combination of his enthusiasm and what we tasted, per-
suaded us to bring it to you. Six in case.

5163 RUSTICANO RED in Double-Litre (68 0z.). 3.89 21.01
Grown in the Valpolicella area northwest of Verona. Like Val-
policella and Beaujolais, it is light, fruity, refreshing, and at
its best when served slightly cool. Those who would like to
serve good red wine freely this summer will do well with this
charming example of Italian red wine.

Here again, Frank Schoonmaker is proud of this discovery
which he found among the hills of Piedmont. We share his
opinion that Barolo is perhaps the best red wine of all Italy;
full-bodied, slow-maturing and comparable to a top flight Rhone
Valley red. Generally kept at least three years in wood and
then put in ‘Burgundy’ bottles. Powerful, definitely belongs in
the ranks of great red wines.

682 GRAPPELLO AMARONE 1965 .......... 5.55 59.95
‘Amarone’ means that the grapes are picked at the ultimate
point of ripeness—then stretched out on racks until the grapes
become almost raisins. It is this process, particularly when the
grape is ‘Grappello’ that produces the richest, most long-lived
red wine of Italy. This rare wine was produced along the shores
of Lake Garda by the outstanding firm of Frassine. If you have
never tasted great Italian red wine, here is your opportunity.

of a better bargain in good dry white wine? It is clean, dry,
honest and designed to cheer. Case of 6.
5164 RUSTICANO DRY WHITE

in Double Litre (68 Bere oe 3.89 21.01
Grown in the Soave area, just outside of Verona. Dry, light;
pleasing bouquet—ideally suited for your day-in-day-out warm
weather white wine. A case of six double-litres is the equal of
17 bottles—thus costing you only $1.24 the bottle if you buy
a case. Can you think of a better summer wine value?

 

FIESTA OF ITALIAN WINES

Italy is a gay, colorful, and civilized country. The wines that
are produced within its borders reflect this. Like the people
of Italy, Italian wines are charming, cheerful, carefree and
joyous — and in many instances, highly sophisticated, re-
flecting ancient civilization.

The money-saving aspect of Italian wines is not just good,
but exceptional — particularly in an era of ever increasing
wine prices. If you are budget-wise, you would pay particu-
lar heed to the Oversized bottles listed on this page — they
will not only save you money, but bring their own special
quality of Italian wine pleasure to your summer dining table.
