 

RED BURGUNDY

Among recent vintages, ‘1970’ was the ‘star’ in Bordeaux; the
‘1969’ took the center of the stage in Burgundy. As in Bordeaux,
the world demand for the great vineyards of Burgundy are out-
stripping the limited capacity of the vignerons to produce.
The result has been that wine prices at the leading vineyards
have been spiraling upwards, complicated by a low harvest
yield in 1971, devaluation, and an eagerness on the part of the
Burgundians to achieve the high prices commanded by the
great vineyards of Bordeaux.

Below, we are dealing with great vintage years from top flight
vineyards. The cellars of Burgundy are now denuded, but we
happily report that we have brought some of the gems to our
friends in America. Choose among them.

1969 VINTAGE

We know of no better way of testifying to the true excellence
of the 1969 red Burgundies than to simply quote Frank
Schoonmaker’s recently issued Vintage Report, “1969 is an
exceedingly great year in Burgundy, quite in the class with
fabulous 1961 ...deep-colored, rich, everything that fine Bur-
gundies should be...a few conceivably even 20/20, which is
as high as I can go.” We know of no more persuasive statement
to justify anticipating your future requirements than the objec-
tive evaluation by Mr. Schoonmaker—an opinion shared unani-
mously by the Burgundy wine growers’ community.

In our opinion, Drouhin is among the most reliable sources of
top flight Burgundies. Despite the low cost, his Soleil Noir is
a well balanced delight with finesse, depth, and balance.

252 PINOT NOIR DE MARSANNAY ......... 3.99 43.10
A ‘best buy.’ Estate-bottled by Clair Dau on superior Burgun-
dian soil. Noble Pinot Noir flavor emerges.

Estate-bottled, Bachelet-Ramonet.

$24; AUXEY-DURESSES ROUGE ............ 5.99 64.70
A ‘sleeper’ from the hills behind Pommard. There is a drinking
reward economically for acquiring a less well known great
red wine. Estate-bottled, Rene Roy.

RING eink bs oe - eden wr 6.79 73:45
Despite its small size, Vosne-Romanee is the most remarkable
and famed of the wine producing communes of all France. Hard
to come by, never inexpensive, worth seeking out for its breed
and elegance. Estate-bottled, Mongeard-Mugneret.

124 acres of vinous blessedness. Distinguished more for its
breed than for its power. An excellent example. Estate-bottled
by Marcel Rion.

A vineyard that enjoys the same exalted classification in Bur-
gundy that a ‘First Growth’ occupies in Bordeaux. But, alas,
there are only 37 acres of Bonnes Mares. Incomparable finesse.
Estate-bottled, Clair-Dau.

477. ECHEZEAUX (Romanee-Conti) .......... 18.90 204.00
None remains in France or in the cellars of the importers. We
own seven irreplaceable cases. Estate-bottled, Domaine de la
Romanee-Conti.

Time-Life Vintage Chart reports, “1966—outstanding year. Great
fragrance, fruit and superb balance. Shows remarkable promise
of longevity.” They rated it 19 out of a possible 20—only sur-
passed by 1961.

Frank Schoonmaker is inclined to think this is the best Nuits
