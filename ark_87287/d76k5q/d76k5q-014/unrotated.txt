guished, and one of France’s best contemporary composers—
as well as the proud proprietor of CHATEAU DE MIRAVAL,
where this wine is estate-bottled. You may have already heard
his improvisations of Bach on records which are popular
throughout the world. You may have even heard him in concert
with his group at the Philharmonic. Mr. Loussier loves the
wines of his beloved France so much that he bought a vineyard
in Provence. He only produces Vin Rosé and his wine reflects
his creativity, charm, and dedication. Try it—you will come back
for more.
