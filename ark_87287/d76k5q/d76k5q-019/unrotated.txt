ROUGE 197]

From ‘La Vielle Ferme’

Here is the very red wine that Craig
Claiborne praises enthusiastically in
his newsletter—the kind of red wine
that will go well with the hamburgers
and steaks as they come off your grill,
especially if served slightly cool—as
they do in France. We know of no
better red wine value. Do you?
