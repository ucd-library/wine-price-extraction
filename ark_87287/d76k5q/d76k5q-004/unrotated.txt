WHITE BURGUNDY

We share the opinion of JAMES BEARD that during the Spring-
Summer period, to experience the great wines of the world,
there is a natural transition from the classic red Bordeaux to
the classic white wines of Burgundy. Even the menus become
a bit simpler—more emphasis on fish, interesting salads, etc.
As a corollary, perhaps the wine should not be as complex.

Undoubtedly the greatest dry white wines of the world are
produced in those provinces of France that bear the names of
‘Cote d’Or’ and ‘Maconnais.’ It is still astonishing to us to find
that supreme examples can still be found at below $5.00 the
bottle—and only the glorious and limited production rarities
have moved up to $10 or more. If your intent during July and
August is not to abandon adherence to excellence, we enthusi-
astically recommend that you pay heed to those listed below.

1971 VINTAGE

We summarize Frank Schoonmaker’s vintage chart, “In Chablis,
a scant half-crop was produced at best—-many wines destined
to rank among the best of their decade. As for the whites of
Cote d’Or, they appear to be of wholly remarkable quality, full-
bodied, rather high in alcohol, yet well-balanced and capable
of improving if laid away ... unlike any year we have had since
the 1961s.”

pensive, a great rarity and an experience.

1970 VINTAGE

The 1970 white Burgundies proved elegant, graceful, fruity, of
