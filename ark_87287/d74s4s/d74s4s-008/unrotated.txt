great Madeiras. Here is a remarkable collection of authentic old

vintage Madeiras that cannot be matched, either in continental
Europe or the United States.

Some of these wines are made exclusively from wine grapes that
pre-dates the Phylloxera scourge that devasted the island in
1873. The front label, individually numbered, states the total
number of bottles in existence, while the back label gives the
personal history of the wine. Most of these wines are hand signed
by a Director of the firm, certifying that the bottle contains a
genuine Madeira of the vintage stated.

When these are gone, the opportunity to taste authentic old vintage Madeiras of this calibre
will be lost forever
