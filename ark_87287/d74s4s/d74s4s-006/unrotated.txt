one of America's noblest
products. 8 years old and 101
proof.

 

Scotland has sent
us their Scotch liqueur and
now Canada sends us their
Canadian liqueur which uses
fine Canadian whiskey as a
base. It bears the name of
the man who is reputed to

have created it-GEORGE M.
TIDDY.

The mysterious attraction and
goodness of CHARTREUSE,
both the yellow and the green,
has made it the most sought-
after Christmas gift through-
out all of the civilized coun-
tries of the world.

 

DOM PERIGNON 1962 CHAM-
PAGNE represents the heights
that champagne can achieve.
Since it is in short supply, we
suggest early acquisition.

 

A new and enthusiastic vogue
is BOMBAY DRY GIN through-
out America. Will add distinc-

tion to your martinis.

TEACHERâ€™S HIGHLAND
CREAM is not a favorite at
Oxford simply because of the
educational implications ot
its name. Rather, it's because
its flavor is unmistakable, dis-
tinctively Scottish, and ex-
cellent even by the haughty
standards of a Don.
