A wonderful 1945, velvety, soft and full. Authentic wines of this vintage are now hard to come by and this Volnay is the
equal of many Burgundies that bring twice the price.

from one of Pommard’s greatest vineyards, Epenots, and the product of a great year, 1949, this is a real collector’s item.

Estate Bottled, Kesselstatt Cellars

The Moselle wine district includes, in addition to the vineyards of the Moselle proper, the valleys of two little tributaries —
the Saar and Ruwer. The wines of the Ruwer, of which this Kaseler is a superb example, are particularly noteworthy for their
bouquet and lightness and their charm. An Auslese of one of the greatest of all years.

Estate Bottled, Langwerth Von Simmern

Coming as it did between 1947 and 1949, the year 1948 was somewhat overshadowed. It ranks none the less as an excellent
vintage. This Spatlese is one of the most remarkable bottles at under $2.00 now available in this country.

Owned and operated by the German State, the Steinberg vineyard is traditionally ranked as one of the Rheingau’s four or five

a great vintage.

Vouvray is a perennial American favorite, and has been ever since the First World War, when American Army Headquarters
were established at Tours, a few miles from the village of Vouvray. Gay and fresh and charming, this dry 1950 is a delightful

luncheon wine.

Shipped by Marc Bredif

Next to Champagne, Sparkling Vouvray is perhaps the best and most popular sparkling wine of France. Fruity and light and
gay, it has additional advantage of being considerably less expensive than Champagne today, and is an extraordinary value at
this price.

Estate Bottled, Caves de Pouilly
There are two Pouillys in France — one is in southern Burgundy, and is more often called Pouilly Fuissé; the other is on
the Loire River, not far from the old city of Nevers, and produces a white wine generally called Pouilly Fumé. Fumé,
incidentally, is the local name of the Sauvignon Blanc grape, from which the best wines of this area are made. Here is a
delightful, refreshing Loire wine which will please everyone.
