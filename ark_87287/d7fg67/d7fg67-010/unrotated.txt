have an easy-going charm and they w el-

come the visitor with a dignified courtesy.
People continually put themselves out
to see that we enjoyed this fascinating,
gilded city. A perfect cocktail hour with
Jim Thompson, who has done such a re-
markable job with Thai silks. His house
is a museum of all that is good in Thai
and Chinese art, one of the truly great
houses of my experience. He 1s also an
enthusiastic eater and knows whereot he
speaks.
Another memorable day was spent with
Terb Koomsoi, who does fantastic food
shows on TV in Bangkok. She prepared
a luncheon in her home and allowed us
to watch its intricate preparation. I’ve
seldom seen such a perfect buffet table.
Most of the food is Chinese but some of
the local cuisine is augmented by hot
chili peppers. The kind of food to look
for is barbecued prawn, fish in sweet and
sour sauce and local fruits, which include
magnificent pineapple, papaya, grape-
fruit and an intriguing fruit known as
mangosteen.

TEHRAN, IRAN, JUNE 27TH
The caviar capital of the world. At the
airport, one can buy the finest caviar
for about eighteen dollars a pound. In
restaurants, it is unbelievably reasonable.
We tried it at the Coq d’Or with three
extremely generous helpings, a glorious
kebab of fresh sturgeon and salad and
local Vodka made by a friend. All this
plus fruit and coffee for under twenty
dollars for the three of us.
At Leon’s, three of us ate large portions
of caviar with vodka and a fabulous
shaslik and fruit and salad, which came to
only thirteen dollars. Both of these res-
taurants are in lovely gardens which
enhances the feeling and dramatic pre-
sentation of the food and lends an air of
well-being that more than makes up for
many of the pressures of travel.
At La Residence we drank a bottle of
Persian wine (cabernet, we were told—
which we found out to be an unbeliev-
ably well-balanced red) and it was com-
plemented by charcoaled filets of beet;

followed by the perennial caviat and

     

vodka. Here is anothet well-appointed
restaurant located in a sheltered garden
with lovely old, hurricane lamps on each
table: and if you close your eyes and
dream a little, you might be in a great
Western restaurant. complete with the
unobtrusive service and a diversified se
lection of wines and spirits. To com-
plete the romantic background, a yellow
Persian moon was rising and the first
evening star was as soft as the fabled one
of Islam. The next day we trekked to the
magic city of Isfahan, were the summer
pavilion of the old shahs stands at the
edge of a pool where the twenty columns
are reflected so perfectly, it is called the

Palace of the Forty Columns.

Another restaurant not to be overlooked

in Iran is l'Auberge, basically a Russian
restaurant which serves a traditional Cut-
let Kievsky. With this, the local diners
drink vodka rather than wine or beer;
and believe it or not, a typically Persian
restaurant boasted the rather Anglo-
Saxon name of Palace Hotel Grill; it
featured a wonderful specialty dish of
kebob. And it was fun to have the rice
mixed with a huge quantity of butter, a
raw egg, and a piquant sauce, all tossed
together as a do-it-yourself project at
your own table, and eaten with excellent
broiled marinated lamb.

And in this country, you will find superb
fruit in all of the restaurants, cherries,
apricots, snow white peaches, tiny apples
of excellent flavor—and the drinks that

are abundant everywhere are Scotch,

   
  

 

Vodka. Anise. Bloody Marys, all served

with roasted almonds and pistachio nuts

a welcome change from our potato chips

and peanuts
PARIS, FRANCE, JULY 5TH
Perhaps I am a sentimentalist, or maybe

because at my age I cannot fathom the
enigma of Japanese food, strangeness of
life in Hong Kong and Thailand — but
whatever the reason, there were almost

tears ot joy in my eyes as | landed in

 

Paris and practically kissed the Eiftel
Tower. Paris is in full swing, the glorious
chestnut trees that line the boulevards
are rich in foliage. Happy tourists are be-
ginning to fill the town; flowers are in
abundance; and shops are showing their
finest wares.

The historic sights and museums have a
multitude of visitors but the talk is mostly
about special discoveries at a favorite
restaurant. One gets more tips on where
to dine than one gets in New York on
the races, or on baseball games. Basic-
ally, I suppose, I have developed aftec-
tion for the small restaurants—those that
appear on private or secret lists—the

little bistros.
