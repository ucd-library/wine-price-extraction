almost the first thing I read was an ar-
ticle that appears in the current issue of
REALITIES, which talks about the “Ten
Best Restaurants in Paris.” This article
was stimulating, provocative but I don't
particularly go along all the way. How-
ever, I will try and be objective and re-
port the findings without prejudice. The
gastronomical jury’s selection was com-
posed by six connoisseurs, including
Pierre Mouquet, the President of the gas-
tronomically famed “Club de Cent’, a
celebrated author, a leading lawyer, a
wife of a diplomat au courant at elegant
dining, the high Chamberlain of the
Burgundy Tastevin Society, and a maga-

zine editor

These authorities agreed to limit theit
selections to ten and not to consider big
hotels, specialized restaurants that might
feature a province or a particular kind
of food and to eliminate the little bistros.
Their ultimate findings after ten days of

jury sessions were as follows:

TWO THAT CAN BE CONSIDERED
NATIONAL MONUMENTS RATHER
THAN RESTAURANTS
TOUR D’ARGENT features a glori

ous view of the Seine, Notre Dame

refinement, a superb cellar of old wines
and creative cuisine. MAXIM’S of
ters the halo of famous people, amusing
anecdotes, the atmosphere of 1900, the
same ancient waiters, elegance, people
to be recognized, the spirit of old Paris

food be autifully prepared and served in

j
the grand manner

   

THREE CLASSIC RESTAURANTS
LASSERRE...has just received the
crown of honor from Michelin—three
stars; the best rognons sautés of Paris;

solid, exc ellent cuisine

LUCAS CARTON: in the classic: tra
dition; 150 years old; the 1918 Armistice

was planned here; quiet and luxury are

emphasized; eating is serious and very
French; try woodcock flambé.

GRAND VEFOUR...restored to old-

fashioned elegance by my old friend,

Raymond Oliver back in 1948; inimitable
old-world atmosphere; a jewel box of

yesteryear. Try the quail pie.

 

FIVE RESTAURANTS
THAT ARE PEERS
ESCARGOT MONTORGUEIL...some

gourmets consider this the

best of Paris:
perhaps the ancestor of all the bistros;
the cradle of great cooking in the heart
ot Les Halles: all energy 1S dedicated CO
what is on the plate.
LAPEROUSE... actors, financiers, ballet
dancers, epicures, writers gather here;
the private rooms are famed; high al-
legiance to the traditional; overlooks the
Seine; a historic shrine that survives an
earlier era
FOUQUET'S ... frequented by business
men, mostly trom the film industry; the
cuisine is excellent; particularly if you
walk up one flight; the Champs Elysees
is below you; try the Tournedos Stras-
bourgeois
LAURENT ...you will be glassed in
among the flowers in the winter and eat
in gardens during the warmer weather:
its classic severity is limited by a summer
resort atmosphere; try the prime rib of
beef with bone marrow

THE BERKELEY

rant that has adapted to the modern world

an elegant restau

by speeding the service and constantly
changing the menu; very popular among
knowing eaters; try the venison with
croutons

And here they are—the ten great restau

rants in Paris selected by a knowing jury

 

of Parisien connoisseurs. I do not apres
with them whole-heartedly but I will re
serve my judgment until I have an oppor-
tunity to express my Opinion away from
the “heat of battle contemplating Cau-
tiously LL Ey beloved Victorian arm
chair. I will report in these columns of
Sherry s this Fall.

I know many of you may concur with this
jury, some of you will have exceptions in
a few areas, and some of you will disagree
violently. If any of you want to give vent
to your feelings and attitudes, please
write me care of Serry’s—I promise to
read your letters carefully, answer
promptly and will give full weight to
your evidence. Anyhow, it might be fun
for you to write and for me to answer

THE CURRENT WINE PICTURE
The flowering of the vine ended in Bor
deaux about June 27th, and there is much
talk among the Paris wine merchants and
wine lovers during these early days of
July about the 1962 vintage. They are
praying that this year prove plentiful and
of good quality to counteract the frustra
tion created by the fantastically high
prices they must pay for a barrel of any
good 1961 wine. The evidence is in
the 1901's are truly great — everyone
wants at least a barrique but they are
shocked at the number of francs they
must pay tO, Seu I

It was Sichel, a highly regarded wine mer
chant of London, who recently stated
“If 1811 was a comet year, perhaps, 150
years later, we can call 1961 a rocket year
Bordeaux, British and American wine
merchants alike, have watched prices of
red wine soar with the same helpless teel
ing of incredulous amazement that they
watched rockets bearing dauntless hu
mans into their respective orbits

The flowering is about 20 days behind the
average year, which will really delay the
harvest gathering until the early part of
October, unlike 1959 and 1961. which
started early in September. The cold wave
that hit Europe earlier this Spring was of
no help. Because of this, there is not much
Optimism on the part of the growers fot

either a great year in quality or in quan
