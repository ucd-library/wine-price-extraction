953 BEAUJOLAIS 1955, Domaine du Ringuet

Our best-seller among our red wines and for good reason
—we quote the review this wine received in the New
York Times, January 29th, “‘then there is a Beaujolais that
is all a Beaujolais should be, but alas, seldom in this

of crushed grapes. In our opinion, a true discovery for
those who want true Beaujolais at a modest price.”
