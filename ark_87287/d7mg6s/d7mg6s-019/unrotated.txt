1225 FORTNUM & MASON’S FINE
CHAMPAGNE COGNAC .. . 6.99 80.00

This interesting example of dry, English Market Cognac is particularly relished by Cognac connoisseurs. Great
Britain is a nation that takes its Brandy very seriously. Aware of this, the 250 Year Old firm of Fortnum & Mason
have acquired some of the best and oldest stocks of Cognac to meet the uncompromising demands of knowing
Londoners.

1297 SINGLE CASK UNBLENDED
COGNAC (1929 Vintage) oO. 9.45 108.00

Here is an Estate-bottled Cognac that was produced during a great vintage year (1929) in the most celebrated
part of the Cognac country, “Grand Fine Champagne”. It has remained in its unblended state in barrels from 1929
until the present date. Cognac of this calibre is difficult to obtain because no more than a few small growers have
the patience and aptitude to put aside, year after year, a distillation of their outstanding vintages.

the best Cognac produced during a particularly outstanding year for their own
future use—ultimately this old precious reserve is served to honored guests on spe-
cial occasions, For the first time, Francois Hine, managing director of this venerable
firm, has consented to part with a few of these treasured bottles—each is numbered
and bears a back label relating the unique history of the contents, hand-signed by a
