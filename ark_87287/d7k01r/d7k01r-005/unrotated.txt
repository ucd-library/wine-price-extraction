(St. Julien)

A good St. Julien is always a reason for
rejoicing, and at only $5.49 the bottle,
everyone can enjoy the celebration.

CHATEAU LEOVILLE BARTON (St. Julien)
Superb value for this distinguished wine from the
heart of the Médoc.

VIEUX CHATEAU CERTAN (Pomerol)
Sturdy and luscious, showing the benefit of its bottle
age. Outstanding value.

CHATEAU PICHON-LALANDE (Pauillac)
Lighter and suppler than neighboring Baron. Classic
red Bordeaux.

CHATEAU PALMER (Margaux)
An almost insignificant price for so imposing a wine.

CHATEAU MOUTON-ROTHSCHILD (Pauillac)
Who can pass up the power of Mouton at so extra-
ordinary a price?

CHATEAU HAUT BRION (Graves)

The relatively small patch of vines at Ch@teau Haut
Brion has been making venerable wines for more than
three centuries. Here is an amazingly affordable
way to partake of this noble heritage.

CHATEAU LATOUR (Pauillac)
Lordly. Radiant. Some claim Latour produced the
best Médoc in 1967.

CHATEAU MARGAUX (Margaux)

Traditional velvetiness and a bouquet unsurpassed
by any red wine in the world.
