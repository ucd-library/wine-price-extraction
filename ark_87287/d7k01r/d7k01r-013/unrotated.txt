RHINES & MOSELLES 1973

The late Frank Schoonmaker stated in his Vintage Chart, "Some complain that the '73s
were not as good as the incomparable '71s, which is indeed the case, but this is

asking too much of God.

In truth, the 1973s are excellent everywhere,"

We are dealing with elegant, light wines with fine fruit that will bring joy to summer
dining. All wines listed below are of the great 1973 vintage, all estate-bottled by
leading growers. Choose among them - the savings are substantial.
