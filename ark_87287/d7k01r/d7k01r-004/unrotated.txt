VILLE BARTON

RED BORDEAUX 1970

CHATEAU ROUSSET (Céte de Bourg)

A find from a fine vineyard across the Gironde from

the Haut-Médoc,

CHATEAU PITRAY (Bordeaux Superior)
Good wine at an even better value,

CHATEAU LAROQUE (St. Emilion)

A fine St. Emilion with this much bottle-age at such

a low price? Yes!

CHATEAU HAUT-CORBIN (St. Emilion)
Full quota of fruit and flavor apparent here. Good

value,

CHATEAU SIMARD (St. Emilion)

Very popular - and rightly so.
1970 vintage.

CHATEAU BOUSCAUT (Graves)

Bouscaut fared extremely well in the celebrated 1970
vintage. Superb for present drinking.

From the renowned

248 CHATEAU LEOVILLE BARTON
(St. Julien)

We agree with the director, Ronald Barton -
this is one of the best Médocs of 1970.

Among the most consistently popular red wines of
Bordeaux. Much fruit and depth.

CHATEAU BEAUSEJOUR (St. Emilion)
Among the best bottles of St. Emilion we have re-
cently tasted. Complex, richly bouqueted.

CHATEAU FIGEAC (St. Emilion) ,
Now recognized as the second best wine of St. Emilion,

Only Cheval Blanc is Figeac's master.

CHATEAU HAUT BRION (Graves)
Jean Delmas, Haut Brion's réegisseur, is particularly

proud of this noble wine.

CHATEAU MARGAUX (Margaux)
For those with the requisite patience, this Margaux
will more than reward the wait of another decade.
