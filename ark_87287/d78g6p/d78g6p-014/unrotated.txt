 

THE NOBLEST OF AMERICAN WINES

We quote from the just released book THE JOYS OF WINE written by Clifton Fadiman
and Sam Aaron, â„¢When future observers survey the history and development of wine
in the United States, I believe they will label the latter half of the twentieth century

the dawn of the golden age of American wine."

Based on this belief, we have searched out diligently the best that America has to
offer and we report our findings below. This list is not all-inclusive since there
are many wines worthy of being included but we did want to offer our clientele an
outstanding cross-section. If you have never experienced the best of America,
this list should provide you with a unique opportunity.
