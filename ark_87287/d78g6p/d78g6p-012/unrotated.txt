TAVEL ROSE 1972, Bellicard
This delightful ptnk wine of Tavel is acclaimed everywhere
as the best vin rose produced on the globe, Dramatic best
buy.

 
 

CROZES HERMITAGE ROUGE 1972, Chapoutier
Nearly as good as Hermitage itself and a fraction of the
price, Just coming into its own,

  

  
   
   
   
 

CROZES HERMITAGE BLANC 1972, Chapoutier
The hot sun and rocky terrain give white wines from the
Rhone an intriguing deep character, You will love this
elegant example from M, Chapoutier as we do.

 
 
   
 
    
   
 
 
 

CHATEAU NEUF=DU-PAPE 1973, Domaine de Nalys
Alexis Lichine discovered the Chateauneuf of Dr. Nalys on
one of his wine tasting trips through the Rhone Valley. We
share his unbounded enthusiasm for this rich and robust

Rhone red.

 
 
   
   
     
   
   
 
 

CHATEAU NEUF-DU-PAPE 1966, Domaine des Pontifes
Good Chateauneuf-du-Pape is always hard to come by -
good mature Chateauneuf even more so. This fine wine,
from a vineyard that was once a favored source for wines
of the popes in Avignon, already benefits from seven years
in bottle. The price is remarkably low for a wine of this

quality.

 
 
       
   
 
 

981 HERMITAGE ROUGE 1971, Chapoutier
Considered the best single red wine produced in the Rhone
Valley. Still young, the wine is already rich and pleasing
but it will improve immensely in the yeats ahead,

  
   
   
     
   
   
 
  

500 CHATEAU GRILLET 1969, Neyret-Gachet
The rarest white wine in all France. Most of the scant
production is reserved for the pleasure of the patrons of
the famous La Pyramide restaurant in Vienne close by.
But we have secured a few cases of this treasure for the

pleasure of _our patrons.
