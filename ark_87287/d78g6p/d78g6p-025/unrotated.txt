We can only urge you, when next in Burgundy, that you visit Drouhin's remarkable
cellars next to the palace of the Dukes of Burgundy. Their origins can be traced
to the Middle Ages. The cellars have been classified as an historic monument by
France,

This offering is no minor event for the wine lovers of New York, Drouhin wines
are produced in small quantity, are hard to come by, and generally among the
most costly Burgundies available so it can only be with much pride that we

offer this excellent selection, surely one of the finest available outside Burgundy.

BERNKASTELER GRABEN 1973 - FROM DR, H. THANISCH

WILL GLADDEN THE HEART OF ANY LOVER OF MOSELLE

There are two vineyards in the Moselle town
of Bernkastel that are classified GREAT -
they are Bernkasteler Doktor and Bernkasteler
Graben - the standard by which all other
Moselles are judged.

Until recently Dr. Thanisch's label read
'Bernkasteler Doktor and Graben.â€™ The
wine then came from both vineyards, thus
both names. Under recent German regula-
tions they had to separate, stating their
individual identity on the label.

The vineyards are adjacent, both achieving
the noblest heights in delicacy, bouquet,
finesse and longevity. Although rated on a
par, the 'Doktor' commands well over $10
the bottle while the 'Graben' is on sale at
No. 871 only $5,99 the bottle, $71,88 the case.
$5.99 the bottle - $71.88 the case Quantity limited. Only 3 cases to a customer.
