1978 RED BURGUNDY

Burgundians are calling this the greatest vintage since 1961. After tasting
a number of advance bottlings, we're happy to say that we agree. The wines
share an intense raspberry bouquet, dark color, with healthy acidity and
tannin. Will be long-lived, just as were the great Burgundies of yesteryear.
