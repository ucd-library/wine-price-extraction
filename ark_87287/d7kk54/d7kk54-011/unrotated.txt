CHATEAU MOUTON eee ve

A Marriage of
Greatness and Drinkability

 

 

Here is a happy combination! - 90% of Mouton- |
Rothschild is made from the Cabernet Sauvignon

grape, which gives the wine its inky depth, great |
power and longevity. And yet 1967 was a 'gentle'
year so the Cabernet did not overwhelm. The

result is a soft wine for Mouton -- lush, complex
and perfect for present drinking. |

None remains in Bordeaux -- here is a last chance
to enjoy the magnificence of Mouton at its peak.
