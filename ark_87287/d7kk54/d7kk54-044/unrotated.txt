 

DESCHAMPS BLANC
DE BEANGCS (N.Y.
New York's best value in sparkling
wine is bottled especially for us. Fresh,
dry, fruity, beautifully bubbly. A wine
good enough to serve at small, intimate
dinners -- and inexpensive enough to

enjoy at big and festive parties.

The Most Remarkable Eaux-de-Vie, Armagnacs and Cognacs

= of France from the cellars of JEAN DANFLOU

When in Paris, art lovers are advised to go to the Louvre-~
and brandy lovers to Jean Danflou on Rue Thabor. We heeded
this sage advice, and found the most remarkable treasure
trove of Eaux-de-Vie, Armagnacs and Cognacs we have ever
tasted. There are few Parisian gourmets who have not a
the famed -- and glorious -- 'prandy boutique’ of Jean Dantfiou.

We happily offer the best of his treasury to you ~~ each a

magnificent example of the best France has to offer.
