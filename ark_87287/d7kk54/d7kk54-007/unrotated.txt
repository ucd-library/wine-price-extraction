CHATEAU ROUSSET 1973 (Cotes de Bourg) 3./9 43.95
Our best-selling Bordeaux gets better and better with

bottle age. Possesses an amazing depth and flavor for

a wine so reasonably priced. Stocks are getting low, so

we urge the many enthusiastic fans of Chateau Rousset to act quickly.

 
 
 
     
 

570 CHATEAU DE LARMARQUE 1976 3. 0d 46.75
(Lamarque/Haut-Medoc)
The appellation may be simple -- "Cru Bourgeois

euperieur’ -—- but the wine is exceptionally good.
Surely one of the best Bordeaux bargains we've come across in years.

 
 
   
    
   
 

893 CHATEAU DES TROIS CANONS 1973 (St. Julien) 4,99 98.50
Chateau-bottled St. Julien at less than $5 the bottle!

"More than deserving" of its Second Growth
Status, says Alexis Lichine. This dramatic
'74 confirms the judgment.
