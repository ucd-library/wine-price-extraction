SEND US THREE OF HIS GLORIES

 
 
   
 

  

CHATEAU PEYMARTIN (St. Julien) 79.50
Incredible value here. This wine has the fullness of fruit
and delicacy of style of a Bordeaux costing significantly more.

      
  

  

CHATEAU HAUT BEYCHEVELLE 7
GLORIA (St. Julien) 89.00 |
Henri Martin's second label is better |
than most other winemakers! first!
Remember the incredible 1975 Haut
Beychevelle Gloria? This '78 is even
better. Produced and bottled at Chateau
Gloria itself. Highly recommended.
