GRAND BRUT

Many Champagne connoisseurs in France
are of the opinion that a 'sans annee'
can often exceed a vintage Champagne y
in balance and excellence since the wine- ie EPERTLIAU-FRATICE
maker enjoys the freedom of matching the V7
dryness of one year against the richness
of another, achieving balanced harmony. __ 7

Jouet is living testimony to that wisdom. On Sale - was $14.95.
