Atlantic coast, through to Sancerre and Pouilly, some 500 kilometers to

. the west, you will find an extraordinary range of white wines (plus a
Lo / few delightful reds) to please the palate and linger in the memory.

Suspect that Cler'Blanc may well be the
best white wine value in America.

  

GROS PLANT SUR LIE 1979. Sauvion 21 Fis Sue baccha
The bone-dry flavor and healthy acidity of Gros

Plant makes it a favorite accompaniment to sea-

food. This one, from the wonderful Sauvion family of

wine-makers, is best of class.

COTEAUX: DU LAYON 1976, Sauvien ct Puls 5.40 46.75
From the valley of the Layon, a tributary of the

Loire. Light, golden in color, this wine has a

shght sweetness that is so well balanced with acidity

that it never cloys. Wonderful for sipping alone, or to ee
omelets, lobster, and many other foods.

MUSCADET, LA NOBLERAIE 4.49 aL,
1979, Sauvion et Fils

In numerous blind tastings, this Muscadet
from Sauvion has surpassed other Muscadets
costing up to $6 the bottle. Here you'll find
an admirable balance of fruit, acidity and
texture. Just about as good as Muscadet
can be -- a remarkable wine value, too.

VOUVRAY 1979, Sauvion et Fils 4.59 52.99
The Chenin Blanc grape flourishes at Vouvray.

Here's a clean, dry, Tee wine that captures

the essence of what a good Vouvray should be

CHINON ROUGE 1979, Sauvion et Fils | 4.99 98.950
Historic Chinon produces a fresh, violet-scented
red, slightly reminiscent of Beaujolais. Memorable.

QUING YY. 19872, feyons Fipet 9.99 68.7
As the prices of Sancerre and Pouilly Fume rise, why

not try the wine of their near near neighbor, Quincy? Fresh

fruity white from the Sauvignon Blanc grape.

SANCERRE 1979, Raymond Pipet
oancerre is best drunk young, when its charming
flavor and beautiful balance is most intriguing and appealing,
