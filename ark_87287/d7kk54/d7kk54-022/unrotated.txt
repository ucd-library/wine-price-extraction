1976 RED BURGUNDY

A great year -- one of the best of our generation. The finest of the ‘76s

-- the

sort of Burgundies you will find listed here -- are full-bodied, with

substantial tannin for long life. The best since 1969.

THE 1976 WINES OF CHAMBERTIN

FROM THE CELLARS OF JEAN TRAPET

Here are three superb '76s from one of the best sources in all of Burgundy --
the famous cellars of Domaine Trapet. Alexis Lichine, in his authoritative

Guide to the Wines and Vineyards of France (1979) calls Jean Trapet "one of

the best growers on the slope."

Mr. Lichine quotes M. Trapet on the differences among the various wines of
Chambertin. " Chapelle is very similar to Clos de Beze, especially with its
perfumed nose...The Latricieres vineyard is one the same level on the slope

as Chambertin and distinguishes itself from its illustrious neighbor by giving

a wine of greater finesse and bouquet but a shade less power. " -- and
Chambertin itself is, of course, incomparable -- rich, intense, memorable.
