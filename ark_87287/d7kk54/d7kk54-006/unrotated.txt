CHATEAU LANESSAN (Cussac/Haut-Medoc) 1125 137.90

This estate, just across the border from St. Junen,
bears the title "Cru Bourgeoise," but is universally
considered worthy of a much higher rank. Magnificent in ‘70.

CHATEAU PHELAN SEGUR (St. Estephe) 12,45 144.00
Depth and fullness characterize this impressive St.
Estephe which will continue to develop for many years.

CHATEAU GHUAUD LAROoL (et. Jalen) 24 95 25200
Derk color, intense blackcurrent bouquet —— the wine

is Vien, fruity, and destined for a long life. Should reach

its prime in 1990 and beyond.

CHATEAU BEYCHEVELLE (St. Julien) 21.49 247.00
In the 1855 Classification, Beychevelle was granted only

Fourth Growth status. In the 1970s, it was universally recognized

as ranking just below the First Growths. This '75 justifies Beychevelle's

new reputation.

CHATEAU MONTROSE (St. Estephe) 27.49 13.00
One of the biggest, most concentrated and long-lived

of Bordeaux. A "best bet" for any serious wine cellar.

CHATEAU LAFITE-ROTHSCHILD (Pauillac) 69.95 790.00
Some consider this the finest Lafite since 1959.

Its incredible perfume is already evident, but the

fullness of flavor and maturity will come in 10 years

time. A cellar without Lafite 1975 is like a meadow without

flowers, a day without sunshine.

 

CeATOAL LATOUR -(Pauillac) 69.95 795.00
Depth, concentration, long life, and a subtle cedary-
nose -- these are the qualities for which this

magnificent wine is famous.
