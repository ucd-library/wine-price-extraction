THE GRAPE

You cannot make fine biscuits from poor flour, and you

cannot expect fine wine from mediocre grape varieties. It is

not always easy to tell the kind of grapes that make up a
particular wine, since many American labels bear such un-
informative names as Burgundy, Chablis, and Rhine. Some-
times these European names hide an excellent bottle of wine,
but its goodness can only be revealed after the cork is drawn
and never through label information. However, many
American wines are now appearing with the grape variety
clearly indicated on the label. We list below grape names
that are worth looking for.

I’hese grapes are arranged approximately in descending order of merit.
