LAKE ERIE ISLANDS, OHIO

When this area was an unsettled wilderness way back in 1840,
German immigrants planted grape vines on the pleasant
shores of Sandusky Bay. Today, one cannot boast of the
greatness of these wines, but nevertheless several exceedingly
pleasant white wines come from these picturesque islands.
The Catawba and Delaware grape dominate the area.

Engels & Rewwie* 2 s  e
[he Catawba grape was once praised in a poem by
Longfellow. It is distinctly American in flavor, bearing

no resemblance to any European wine. Light and
pleasant.

Island Delaware 1934,
Engels & Krudwig’
Planted in Ohio, the Delaware grape produces the

softest and the mildest of the Eastern wines. It is an

excellent understudy for a Rhine wine or a Pouilly.

This wine fared particularly well at the annual

tasting of the Wine & Food Society held last year. It

possesses more body and depth than most of its Euro-
pean counterparts.
