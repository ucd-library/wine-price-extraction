WINE FROM THIS NATIVE SOIL

The present war has taught us many things. It has
taught us to seek within our own borders for prod-
ucts that formerly flowed freely from Europe.
Americans have recently discovered that cheese
made in Wisconsin can be flavorsome and delight-
ful, dresses designed in New York can be exciting
and beautiful, and wine grown in the Napa Valley
of California or on the shores of Lake Canandaigua
can be surprisingly good.

We do not wish to exaggerate. Nowhere in our
vineyards can you find a Chateau Latour 1929, a
Chateau d’Yquem 1921, or a Krug 1928—but you
can find many bottles of wholly sound and entirely

pleasurable wine.

We are telling this little story of one of our native
arts, wine-making, because we believe in that story.
We are now convinced that this nation is produc-
ing good wine, and ultimately it will produce great
wine.

The wines contained in these pages were not se
lected in hit-or-miss fashion. Only after much care
ful search and many comparative tastings was the
list born. We present these wines with the sincere
belief that they represent the best efforts of Ameri
can Vintners.
