FOUNTAINGROVE VINEYARD, SONOMA

Like buckwheat, and pumpkins,
and Indian corn,

like apples, and maple syrup,

and the tart cranberries of the New England Autumn,

wine comes from the land—the farm.

MADISON AVENUE REcrentr 4-5100

And today our American farms,

our American vineyards,

are coming back.

Once again there are full cellars in the
around Lake Keuka

and Lake Canandaigua;

once again the smell of crushed grapes
fills the air

in Napa Valley,

in Sonoma Valley.
