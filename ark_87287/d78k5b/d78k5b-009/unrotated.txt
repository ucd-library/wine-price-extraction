One of the great vineyards of the Montrachet area is called

Authentic 1949s have almost disappeared completely.
Here is an extraordinarily fine survivor.

670 CHATEAU HAUT BRION BLANC 1955

We are all familiar with the red wine produced at Haut
Brion. A small portion of the vineyard is devoted to mak-
ing the best dry white wine of Bordeaux and one of the
great dry white wines of the world. Shipped to the United
States only in the smallest quantities. A true thoroughbred.

CHATEAU LYNCH BAGES 1945

A rare survivor from a vintage year that is now but a
fond memory in Bordeaux. A Claret of great stature, un-
usual depth and sheer perfection for present drinking.
Alas, there are but 18 cases.

MAZIS CHAMBERTIN 1955
Estate Bottled, Pierre Gelin

One of the most remarkable Burgundian treasures that
we ran across in the Cote de Nuits. From a tiny vineyard
that is the northern prolongation of Chambertin, Clos de
Beze. A very great 1955.

SAVIGNY LES BEAUNE 1937

Estate Bottled, Doudet-Naudin

Many of you are familiar with the treasures of Naudin’s
pre-war “Forgotten Cellar” that was sealed back in 1942
and not opened again until 1955. Here is one of the great
undisturbed and venerable bottles that survived the oc-
cupation. Remarkable.

As a wine name, Chateau d’Yquem represents the ultimate

as Rolls-Royce and Caviar do in their respective classes.
It is a rich, full, glorious and sweet wine from Sauternes.
Normally it commands well over $7 the bottle — at this
unbelievably low cost, we urge that you acquire some for
your special dinner parties.

CLOS, BLANC DE VOUGEOT, 1953

For centuries, the good Cistercian Monks who labored in
the vineyards of Clos de Vougeot have made it a practice
to dedicate a small portion of the vineyard to the produc-
tion of white wine. You will be delighted with the deli-
cate dryness, exquisite finesse and unique bouquet of this
collector’s item.

wine. Commands fabulous prices at the annual German

GRAND MONTRACHET 1955

Estate Bottled, Thevenin

The ‘ne plus ultra’ of all French white wines is Le Mont-
rachet itself —an absolute maximum of 2000 cases a
year is produced by this single 18 acre plot owned by a
dozen proprietors. A glorious, much sought-after 1955.

BRAUNEBERGER JUFFER AUSLESE

During the 19th Century, Brauneberg was the most cele-

ranks with the greatest of the vineyards.

LIESERER NIEDERBERG HELDEN
FEINE AUSLESE 1953, von Schorlemer
The name of von Schorlemer on the label automatically
results in a great Moselle. A “Feine Auslese 1953” puts
it among the giants.

WEHLENER SONNENUHR AUSLESE

An astonishingly fine Moselle from that portion of Scharz-
hofberg owned by the Cathedral of Trier. Few white wines
in the world can compete with it.

1953 Estate Bottled, Johann Josef Prum

A glorious Moselle from Prum with a bouquet and flavor
that is nothing short of astonishing.

In Chambolle, there are two really great vineyards
Musigny and Bonnes Mares. Like Musigny, this has a
glorious perfume and a lingering bouquet.
