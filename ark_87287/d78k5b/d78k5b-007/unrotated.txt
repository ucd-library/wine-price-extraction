Just north of Bourges, there is the little town of Quincy
(no relation to the Massachusetts family ) which has only
550 acres under wine cultivation. Because of low produc-

are its highly perfumed bouquet and unusual finesse.

PINK WINES
BEAUJOLAIS ROSE 1953

At the Domaine des Tours, they follow the practice of
bottling a small amount of Rose for their personal use.
