The best of the 1976 red Bordeaux are fruity, soft and charming wines, and will be gia
ready to drink before the great 1975s. The 1975 and 1976 vintages--like 1961 and
1962--actually complement each other beautifully. The claret-lover is fortunate
indeed that the rich, concentrated, long-lived 75's have been followed to market

by a vintage as copious, excellent and attractive as that of 1976.

Should you wish to reserve any of the 1976 Bordeaux listed here, please send your
check in the full amount. These prices include free delivery within our delivery
area, sometime in the Fall 1979.

For the quality-wise, price-conscious wine lover, these are days of challenge and
reward. Press, radio and television advise us that Pouilly-Fuisse and Pouilly-Fume will
soon be over $15 the bottle; a simple 1978 Pommard will command $20; French Cham-
pagne (like its bubbles) will rise dramatically; and even California wine prices are
escalating faster than the inflation rate.
