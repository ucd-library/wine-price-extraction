253 — BEAUJOLAIS RINGUET 1955

We quote from the New York Times, Jan.
20th, ‘‘then there is a Beaujolais that is all
a Beaujolais should be, but alas, seldom in
this country — purplish-red, with the fruity
aroma and taste of crushed grapes. In our
opinion, a true discovery for those who
want true Beaujolais at a modest price.’
Half bottles at 84¢, case $18.95.

none — the entire vineyard is only 34 acres

proprietors. A dramatic wine experience for
those who like great red Burgundy.

218 — A SURPRISING WINE

From. the Chassagne - Montrachet vine-
yards, more noted for their white wines
than for red, comes this astonishing red
Burgundy. Sturdy, full bodied, and rich in
fruit and breed. An outstanding estate
bottled 1952 from Ramonet. A red Bur-
gundy of true distinction.

282 — POMMARD EPENOTS 1953

Pommard is the best known of all Bur-
gundies — Epenots is the best vineyard.
Here is an estate bottled thoroughbred that
represents Pommard at its best — a far cry
from the dubious Pommard that floods the
market.

206 — LE CORTON 1937
Here is an interesting survivor trom
Doudet-Naudin’'s pre-war cellar — a cellar

walled up back in 1942 and only opened in
1955 in the presence of the French tax
authorities. The wine has been away from
all light and vibration for 13 years. This
Corton 1937 is the jewel of his collection.

Remarkable.
