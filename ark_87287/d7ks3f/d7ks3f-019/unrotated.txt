#5088—A FABULOUS 1955

In a recent blind tasting, this wine from the
soil of Chateau Lafite outpointed Chateau
Lafite itself for present drinking. The reason
—it has matured a bit more quickly. A true
great—only a few cases.

A good Pomerol is noted for its fleshy, fruity

This quite unusual vineyard encloses one of
France’s leading psychiatric hospitals, in
Auxerre. The vignerons are the patients.
The vintage is 1966. The wine is a vin rose
