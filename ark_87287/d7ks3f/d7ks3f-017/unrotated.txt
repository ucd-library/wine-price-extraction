The quotations we are receiving from the Bordeaux market
today startle us by their astronomic levels. We are ignoring
them and are offering wines to you BASED ON OUR COST
AND NOT ON REPLACEMENT VALUE.

It hardly requires an oracle to predict that the great Clarets
listed below will command a substantially higher price a year
hence. The reasons are obvious — fixed vineyard soil facing
ever-increasing demand, world prosperity, continuous growth
of interest in wine, the educational effects of jet travel, etc.
NOW — not a year from now—IS THE RIGHT TIME
10 BUY.

No need to buy a whole case to enjoy the advantage of the case price.
You can buy in units of 14 case (6 bottles) or 14 case (3 bottles)
and still enjoy the case price savings. The only condition is that your
order must comprise a minimum of 12 bottles to take advantage of
the 10% case price savings.

Should you want to buy an individual bottle, you need simply divide
the case price listed below by eleven (11), to arrive at the bottle price.
For maximum savings, please buy in units of 12 or more bottles.

1964

“Rich in fruitiness and charm —a
year eminently worthy of laying down.
Wines from the lesser vineyards are
showing attractiveness for present
drinking but more time will be re-
quired to bring out the ultimate vir-
tues of the ‘first growths’.”’

1963
‘Generally poor, but expectations of
extraordinary value specifically, the
vineyards that generally produce
heavy bodied wines such as Latour,
Haut Brion and La Mission Haut
Brion.”’

1962
‘The neglected 1962 clarets have
finally won deserved recognition —
excellent, early maturing, soft, fruity,
of fine bouquet and for present
drinking... rich in every quality.”

1961
‘One of the best years of this cen-
tury — the equal of 1945 — most
long-lived wines of our generation.’

1959
‘‘Beautiful wines, rich in many ele-
ments — can be enjoyed today; the
great vineyards still possess a life
expectation of at least 20 years.’’
