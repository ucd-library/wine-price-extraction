1818—ST. EDMUND HALL GIN

A distinguished gin with a flavor that has
been approved by generations of members of
St. Edmund’s Hall. A noble spirit to honor
any Martini.

: BI—BROUILLY 1967
The family of the Marquis de Roussy de

0 Sales have cultivated their superb Beaujolais
vineyard, Chateau de la Chaize, for over four

5 centuries. It is estate-bottled, and captures
the fruity full flavor and body of the soil of

L117—“*WIT SHARPENS ON WIT”

This descriptive phrase epitomizes C.P. Snow
and the Oxford Senior Common Room. The
mood is reflected in this bone-dry, well-aged,
distinctively bouqueté Sherry.

1392—-THE APERITIF RAGE
OF PARIS

NICOLAS Sells 650,000 bottles a day to the
wine-lovers of Paris. Some of these bottles
proudly bear the name KINA ROK, the
aperitif that dominates the homes of knowl-
edgeable Parisians.

349—MOUTON CADET 1962

The great wine tradition of Chateau Mouton-
Rothschild is reflected in this carefully
chosen regional red wine developed by Baron
Philippe de Rothschild. As far as we can
learn, there is no longer any 1962 remaining
in Bordeaux or America — only a few irre-
placeable cases.

151—FRENCH BRUT CHAMPAGNE

Unique Champagne opportunity. From a
highly-regarded winemaker in the Cham-
pagne district — completely dry, outstand-
ingly good, and sensationally priced.

 
       

The “MINIATURE WINE CELLAR” pictured here
will make a welcome addition to your own home, or
you can send it as an imaginative container to hold a
dozen bottles of wine that you can send to an apprecia-
tive wine-drinking friend. The cost, whether it be for
your home or as a gift, can be modest or luxurious, as
you wish — simply pick a mixed assortment of any
twelve bottles (or a case of a single wine, if you prefer

-add only $4.95 for the JAMES BEARD WINE
RACK (retails regularly at $12.50).
