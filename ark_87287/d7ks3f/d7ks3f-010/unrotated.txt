CHATEAU LEOVILLE LASCASES Ch Sen
66 promises to achieve the high level of Leoville’s remarkable 1959.

’67— soft, fruity.

CHATEAU LYNCH BAGES (Pauillac) ... 5
Rich, full; almost has the weight of Mouton Rothschild.

CHATEAU PICHON LONGUEVILLE LALANDE (Paullac).. |...
Good colg@and bouquet. Fine balance. Similar to its neighbor Chateau

Latour, i-*weight, depth and longevity. ’°67— outstanding success.
CHATEAU BEYCHEVELLE (St. Julien).........__
Finesse is the distinguishing characteristic in both years.
CHATEAU COS D’ESTOURNEL (St. Estephe)........
66 has deep color; big strong wine.

CHATEAU LASCOMBES (Margaux)

Outstanding color and finesse. Shows the typical subtlety of Margaux’s bouquet.

CHATEAU CLOS FOURTET (St. Emilion)........

Grand Premier Cru St. Emilion. Almost up to Cheval Blanc itself in depth. ee

CHATEAU PALMER (Mareaus) -- 232 2

Good fruit and finish, extraordinary breed. The ’66 will compete with a

First Growths.

CHATEAU LATOUR-A-POMEROL (Pomerol)...............
Big, soft, can be enjoyed almost immediately after bottling.

CHATEAU LATOUR HAUT DRION (Graves). =
Similar characteristics to La Mission Haut Brion listed below. Same proprietor.

CHATEAU LA MISSION HAUT BRION (Graves)...
Splendid color, big, round, fine bouquet and finesse.

CHATEAU MARGAUX (Margaux)...............

Bouquet, color, fruit, in balance, showing well when tasted from cask.

CHATEAU PETRUS (Pomerol)..

Only 16 acres. Hard to come by. Well-rounded and fruity, outstandingly velvety.

CHATEAU LATOUR (Pauillac)

Full-bodied; firm, exceptional breed; both 66 and 67 will obviously live

for many more decades.
CHATEAU HAUT BRION (Graves)......

Very big, full; power combined with elegance. Possibly the greatest single red wine
red wine produced in Bordeaux during the 1966 vintage—’67 not as big

but ready much sooner.

CHATEAU AUSONE (St. Emilion) a re a
Less robust than Cheval Blanc; supreme finesse. Only 17 acres
compared to Cheval Blanc’s 87; therefore harder to come by.
CHATEAU CHEVAL BLANC (St. Emilion)... | Se
Competes with Haut Brion and Latour in strength. Deep color,
relatively soft, good fruit.

CHATEAU MOUTON ROTHSCHILD (Pauillac)

Big, powerful, robust, slow to mature, long-lived. Frank Schoonmakeysstates

‘Mouton is best of the ’67s.”
CHATEAU LAFITE ROTHSCHILD (Pauillac)

Price astonish you? Cost almost this ‘while still in barrel’ in Bordeaux today. s
