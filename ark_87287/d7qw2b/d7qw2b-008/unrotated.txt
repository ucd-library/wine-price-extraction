BRANDY OF RAPOLE

REB SS Be

Delicate Baccarat Decanter holding the Anniversaire Cognac
of the fine brandy house of Croizet. Cognac was laid down by
firm in 1905 to commemorate their 100th anniversary.

One of the most beautiful Baccarat Decanters we have ever
seen. Holds the world-famous Courvoisier Cognac. A gift of
exceptional taste. Please order this one early.

Not only is this Martell Cordon Argent Cognac a treasure in
itself, but becomes doubly precious when delivered as a gift in
a magnificent Baccarat Decanter.

We consider this the greatest single bottle gift since Repeal.
Superb 33 year old Ballantine Scotch in a glorious example of
fine English Cut Crystal. This one in particular should be ordered
early, for not many were shipped to America.

The four decanters illustrated on this page are
top-flight examples of the glassware artistry of
Europe. Since each is done by hand, the supply is
limited and irreplaceable. We therefore respect-
fully suggest you order these early.
