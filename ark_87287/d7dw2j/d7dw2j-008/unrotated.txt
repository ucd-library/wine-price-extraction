one of the most determined men we have ever
met. It is his uncompromising tenacity that
has produced these two glories—particularly
the Cabernet Sauvignon 1974 in Magnum.

—This Greek Mon-
astic winery is situated atop a lofty knoll
which can only be reached by foot or by tram-
way. Unlike most California vineyards, the
wines are made entirely from winery-owned
vineyards. All are excellent but the most in-
teresting is the white Cabernet Sauvignon 1975
—a wine destined to resemble red Bordeaux
but approximates a white Burgundy with a
salmon-hue as the dominant color. The Merlot
1973 won a Gold Award.

We are all accustomed to drinking the wines
of Bordeaux, the Rhone, Burgundy, the Rhine
and Moselle, and California. Our investigation
indicates that many of these will be going up
for fairly obvious economic reasons, the pri-
mary one being inflation that ranges from
country to country anywhere from 6% to 12%.
However, there are more ominous signs —
drought in northern California; March-April
frosts in Bordeaux; demand exceeding limited
supply in Beaujolais, Burgundy, and the Rhone
Valley. It does not take a crystal ball to pre-
dict that our Pouilly-Fuisses and California
Chardonnays will cost more within a few
months. It is also happening in Germany.

Where should one turn to get good wine at
liveable cost? One answer is Italy. Two good
things are happening—the quality of wine is
getting better with each passing year because
of strict regulation by the Italian government
—and also (for reasons that we do not under-
stand too well since we are not economists),
the cost of the good Italian wine at the vine-
yard simply did not go up (we do not know
how long this will last but it is certainly good
news for this Spring and Summer).

We are taking the wines of Italy seriously.
Recently, we comparatively tasted 380 ex-
amples in order to compile this list of wines
we consider the best. Some of them will amaze
you by their excellence; particularly the
Spanna, better Chiantis, Barolo, Carema, Gat-
tinara, and Brunello. For simple everyday
drinking, we are content with fruity young
Valpolicella for the red and the dry, crisp
Soave for the white. This summer, join us in a
Fiesta of Italian wines.

Bottle Case

LAMBRUSGO:(7128)n.5). ea; Ge ee 1.88 21.95
Made principally of the Lambrusco grape, just
west of Bologna. It is always extremely fruity
and sweet with a special intense bouquet. It is
not really a wine-lover’s wine—we don’t like it
—but many of our clientele do. Here is a fine
example at low sale price. Conti.

BARBERA D’ASTI 1975 (#779) .. 1.99 22.95
Barbera is a red wine grape grown in the Pied-
mont region. Deep-colored—full-bodied—excel-
lent with Italian food. Amazingly low-price
here. Bruzzone.

BARDOLINO 1975 (#337)....... 1.99 22.95
Light red, Summer-style wine grown to the
east of Lake Garda. Burati.

VALPOLICELLA 1974 (#669).... 1.99 22.95
Velvety, fragrant, fruity, light in alcohol and
body—hence excellent when served chilled in
warm weather. Burati.

VALPOLICELLA IN 33 OZ.

LITER ("195 2 1.99 22.95
Rougher, lighter, and younger than the Valpoli-
cella above. However, it is in full liter which
makes it economical. Serve chilled on boat or
terrace. Folinari.

SPANNA 1071 (7728)... 0.5 Sc 2.49 28.40
Wow! Spanna is the kind of wine they charge
$12.00 for in a good Italian restaurant. Made of
great Nebbiolo grape in the Gattinara area nol
far from Lake Maggiore. Full-bodied, slow-
maturing; with much depth of flavor. Similar
to a French Rhone. Worth double. Berteletti.

This handsome wicker bottle hold a full 32 oz.

CHIANTI CLASSICO RISERVA

RO7B AP 202).) Gos 0p veacnns x 7eh 2.79 31.85
Won't reach us until June 1st but worth waiting
for. Here is perhaps the best Chianti we have
ever tasted. Hand-made at a jewel-like tiny
estate occupied by the famed Ricasoli family.
INFERNO 4971 (770l sw x Gc 3.25 36.99
Name inspired by Dante. Actually, it is the
most famous of the red wines of Valtellina,
produced along the northern edge of Lom-
bardy, just south of the Swiss border. Rainoldi.
VALPOLICELLA 1973 (#483).... 3.59 38.78
This wine, the best of Valpolicella, is appropri-
ately praised on the back cover (see). Bolla.
BAROLO:1974 (£717)35 ¢sisi@ ° 3.99 45.50
Barolo makes a bid to being the best red wine
of all Italy. Generally kept at least three years
in wood and then put in ‘Burgundy’ bottles.
Powerful. Bruzzone.
GAREMA: 1970 (#844)... ae 3.99 45.50
The wine lovers of Italy are so fond of Carema
that rarely is it ever exported. Made from the
Nebbiolo grape north of Turin. Ferrando.
GRUPELLO AMARONE 1965

(F682) oes eee ae eee 4.84 55.95
Normally commands about $10.00. Basically,
we are dealing with a Valpolicella subjected
to slow, careful vinification resulting in a con-
centrated essence of wine. Frassine.
BAROLO 1967 (#1112). .. 2453 4.99 56.90
1967 is a great year for Barolo. Marchesi Spin-
ola is possibly the best single grower of the
area. The result is a wine that can compete
with an aged Hermitage or Cote Rotie.
GATTINARA 1969 (#833)....... 4.99 56.90
This, and Brunello, are produced in small quan-
tity and are the hardest wines of all Italy to
come by. It is the kind of wine that the Presi-
dent of Italy would serve. Berteletti.
SPANNA: 1961. (47919)\s.32.4 2 es: 5.44 61.99
Note this is a 1961—a great year in northern
Italy as well as in Bordeaux. It has been resting
in bottle well over ten years. It is a rare glory.
Quantity limited. Campi Raudi Vallana.
BRUNELLO DI MONTALCINO

1970) (F780) oc 341.20 ere 8.99 102.50
Brunello is a grape that reaches its apex when
grown on the hillsides near Montalcino, 25
miles south of Siena. We have seen Brunellos
in Italy selling for as high as $50.00. Nardi.

SOAVE IN 33 OZ. LITER (#122). 1.99 22.95
Consumer-oriented wine experts claim this 33
oz. liter of the delicious, sprightly, dry white
wine grown northwest of Venice is possibly
the best value in Summer white wine extant.
Ideal for carefree, Summer entertaining.
Folinari.

SOAVE 1974 (7665) 05 oc 1.99 22.95
Whenever we travel in Italy, somehow we
favor Soave when ordering white wine in
restaurants. Perhaps because it is an innocent
wine—clean, refreshing, dry, and easy-to-drink.
Here is a fine example at low cost. Burati.
PINOT GRIGIO (#808)......... 3.49 37.70
Made of the Pinot Blanc grape along the south-
ern slopes of the Italian Alps. It is Gregory
Thomas’ favorite among Italian white wines.
Dry, delicious. Santa Margherita.

GOAVE 1074 (7S46). 202s. 6. 3.59 38.75
Turn to the back cover where this wine is de-
scribed in greater detail. It captures the spirit
of Italy. Bolla.

CORVO BIANCO 1974 (#857)... 3.95 45.05
The Corvo vineyards are just east of Palermo
and grown on the estate of the Dukes of Sala-
paruta. Travellers to Sicily recognize it as the
best dry white wine of that island.
