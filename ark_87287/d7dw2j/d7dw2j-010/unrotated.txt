 

1966 RED BORDEAUX
In the same great league as 1970—except that it
enjoys four more years of bottle-ageing. These
are hard to come by~gather ye bargains while

CHATEAU HAUT-BEYCHEVELLE

eee 4.49 49.95
At Lafite-Rothschild, wines from younger vines
are called ‘Carruades de Chateau Lafite-Roths-
child.’ At Latour they are called ‘Les Forts de
Latour.’ At Gloria they are called ‘Haut-
Beychevelle Gloria.’ Because younger vines are
used, the price is always a bit lower, but the
excellence and finesse of the vineyard is al-
ways apparent. For drinking immediately, they
are often more satisfactory since they mature
more quickly.
CHATEAU GLOREA «2 oe. F275. 4.99 56.95
Here is the parent—or older vines—of the Haut-
Beychevelle Gloria listed above. It is also the
very wine whose praises were so highly sung

We Proudly Offer The Most Complete Selection
Of Giant Double Magnums

(the equal of four regular bottles)
Of Great Red Bordeaux Available Anywhere On The Globe!

Our associates at Sherry-Lehmann believe in DOUBLE-MAGNUMS in the same way that an
art lover might respect his Van Goghs; the music lover admires Leonard Bernstein's N.Y.
Philharmonic concerts; and the rare book collector looks on an original Shakespearean folio.
This love of the Big-Bottle prompted us to seek out these wonderfully dramatic large bottles
that can add their touch of glamour to any dinner party, even the most prestigious of wine

cellars.

The search was not an easy one—it meant persuading vineyard owners as well as wine-
collectors to part with their secret caches. All are available only in limited quantities, so please
act quickly. We offer them on a first-come, first-served basis.

FRENCH CHAMPAGNE

The Michel Guerard Brut is the perfect, light,
bone-dry, refreshing Summer Champagne and
the Fleur de France 1971 (it appears on the
the cover) is the most glamorous Champagne
of all France presented in the exquisite painted
flower bottle.

Bottle Gase

MARGE BRO of 5.99 71.88
Astonishing! Unbelievable! Incredible! But
true! Yes!—one of the best dry Brut French
Champagnes you have ever tasted at only $5.99
the bottle! Is the kind of Champagne that
would be good value at $9.50 the bottle. We
own only 130 cases so we suggest you order
quickly. What a festive way to launch the
Summer season! (#120)
PERRIER JOUET BRUT........ 8.95 96.66
Perrier Jouet is one of the most prestigious of
the great Champagne houses. Wine of this
calibre normally commands over $12 the bottle.
Sensational opportunity to serve a great dry
Brut Champagne at low sale cost. (#94)
POMMERY & GRENO BRUT.... 8.99 97.09
This is the very Champagne that was served at
the historic wedding of Grace Kelly and Prince
Rainier. They made no mistake when they
chose this world-famous regal Champagne
which is considered the best non-vintage pro-
duced in France, in competition with only
Bollinger and Krug. Also available in Magnums
at $17.99 Magnum, $97.09 case of 6. (#25)
CUVEE MICHEL GUERARD

BRUT ios ee ee hon ee ee 8.99 97.09
Michel Guerard just received the much-coveted
3-Star rating from Guide Michelin. His best-
selling book, Cuisine Minceur, stresses the
happy combination of haute-cuisine and diet.
His Champagne was selected to accompany
airy food because it is light, bone-dry, and free
of sugar addition. It is a Blanc de Blancs glory
from the wine-growing commune of Mesnil
and it can hold its head high against famed
Champagnes that command double the price.
Sheer perfection because of dry lightness for
Summer drinking. (#75)
PERRIER-JOUET BRUT 1971....10.95 118.26
A great vintage Champagne from a great house.
(#36)
DOM RUINART BRUT 1969..... 14.49 156.49
A ‘Blanc de Blancs’ that will compete with the
best and yet half-the-price. (#39)
MUMM’S RENE LALOU 1971...17.99 194.79
In Paris, Rene Lalou is sold at the same price
as Dom Perignon and Taittinger Blanc de
Blancs. It is a great, great Champagne that
represents the best that France can produce—
presented in a 19th Century, classic, unique
bottle. Note that the price is only 60% of that
fetched by its two leading competitors. (#76)
PERRIER-JOUET

FLEUR DE FRANCE 1971..... 24.95 269.45
Here we pause for true greatness. The bottle is
a canvas for hand-painted enamel flowers. This
is the very Champagne featured by Maxim’s
in Paris and Tavern-on-the-Green in New York.
To understand the beauty of this bottle, please
turn back to our front cover which portrays it
in all its glory. Also available in Magnums at
$49.90 each, $269.45 the case. (#36)

STILL CHAMPAGNE
(Champagne Natur)

The rage in Paris is ‘Champagne Natur’—and its
dry, non-sparkling deliciousness now reaches
New York for the first time in decades. Comes
into its own when the temperature rises.

CHARBAUT BLANC

DEZBEANCGS race ya es. 3.99 47.88
Amazingly low price for a still Champagne of
such excellence. (#87)
SARAN NASKURE co aace 4-44. 11.49 124.09
Far and away, the best of them all—rationed in
Paris, London and New York. Presented in the
beautiful Moet Dom Perignon bottle. (#104)
