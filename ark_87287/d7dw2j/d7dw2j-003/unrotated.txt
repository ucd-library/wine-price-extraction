so! (#307)

CHATEAU MAUCAILLOU

IU. Vo i ee 51,20

caillou means ‘difficult pebbles.’ The rugged
soil makes the vine struggle to survive and

Magnums and Half-Bottles at $54.20 the case.
June delivery. (#743)

$59.95 the case. (#290)

a wine to put away for a year or two. (#309)

This Margaux consistently fetches the highest
price of any chateau in the Medoc outside the

1972 RED BORDEAUX

The ’72s are now proving to be a sleeper.
Though maligned during their early life be-
cause they fetched the highest prices in his-
tory, time has healed the wound. Even the
toughest of wine critics now recognize that
the tannin has subsided and the fruit is coming
out in many of the wines. But they must be
chosen carefully. We are dealing with the
‘best buys’ from Bordeaux today.

CHATEAU BELGRAVE ........ 2.99 33.50
Classified Grand Cru Haut-Medoc in 1855. Price
astonishing for such noble heritage. Worth
double. Suggest acquiring six cases at one time

wide recognition. (#442)
CHATEAU FIGEAG............ 5.49 62.60
In the opinion of the knowledgeable, Figeac,

and often surpasses it. We refer you to the New
