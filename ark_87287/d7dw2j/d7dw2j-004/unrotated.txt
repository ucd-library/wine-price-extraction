 

1971 RED BORDEAUX

The dramatic reputation for greatness of the
1970 vintage was so overwhelming, that the
true stature of the succeeding year—1971—did
not receive proper recognition. The score is
now in. Many of the 1971s may be better bal-
anced and outlive the 1970’s from the same
vineyard. We will help you pick the right ones.
