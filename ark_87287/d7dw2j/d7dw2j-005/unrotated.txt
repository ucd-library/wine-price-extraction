 

WINES FROM OUR NATIVE SOIL=-CALIFORNIA

MICHAEL and SAM AARON have just returned from the dramatically beautiful,
quality-conscious, wine wonderland of Northern California. They bring glowing
reports of the high peak of excellence achieved at many of these vineyards—their
enthusiasm is rather like Balboa’s when first he gazed at the Pacific. There is little
question that there are golden nuggets of great Cabernet Sauvignon, Zinfandel,

Chardonnay and Johannisberg Riesling hidden in those California hills. But un-

fortunately they are doled out by the handful and most are consumed only by the
wine—proud, wine-loving Californians. Alas—up to now, New Yorkers were denied
the privilege of obtaining these great American wines—wines that can hold their
heads high even in the company of a Beychevelle, Gevry-Chambertin, Meursault,

or Piesporter Goldtropfchen.

NOW—FOR THE FIRST TIME—New Yorkers can share with San Franciscans the
greatness of the grape as achieved on American soil. All of the best vineyards of
California ar listed below (perhaps the only exceptions are Mt. Eden and Chalone,

ALMADEN-Almaden was started in 1941 in
Santa Clara Valley under the inspired direc-
tion of Frank Schoonmaker. Today it is a giant
producing popular fine wines.

BEAULIEU VINEYARDS-A Frenchman,
Georges de Latour, started Beaulieu in 1900;

Andre Tchelistcheff, a French wine-maker,
formerly Russian, started to make the great
wine at Beaulieu in 1938. For long, it was
Tchelistcheff’s wine that was a standard by
which all other Napa Valley wines were
judged. Heublein acquired the vineyard in 1969
and has maintained the traditional ‘old world’
wine-making practices until today.

BERINGER/LOS HERMANOS - Robert

Balzer, wine editor of the Los Angeles Times/
Mirror, recently conducted a tasting of Cali-
fornia Gamay Beaujolais with a ten-man expert
panel that included Burgess Meredith and Car-
roll O’Connor (widely known as Archie
Bunker). The comments read, “Los Hermanos
Gamay Beaujolais is the big winner! 18.3 points
—or the highest score at the tasting! The wine
is 95% 1974 vintage, 5% of the 1975. Fresh,
light, gay, fruity and soft.” The 50.7-oz. carafe
is equal to two regular bottles, which means
that the cost per fifth comes out to less than
$1.90. Possibly the best red wine buy in town.
Like Beaujolais, serve this Gamay slightly
chilled.

south of San Francisco, and Hacienda and Caymus, north of San Francisco—but we
hopefully expect to offer these in the Fall). The only negative aspect of this joyous
message is that some vineyards are dispatching only minute quantities—so they
must be rationed by the bottle, thus assuring their fair distribution and the greatest
possible exposure to the wine-lovers of New York.

WHILE IN SAN FRANCISCO, Michael and Sam also visited the city’s leading wine
shops and Carefully examined their lists of California offerings. None were as
complete—or as dedicated—to the best of that State as the outstanding collection
that appears below. Choose among them—have a happy trip through the noble

vineyards of California. Please order quickly because some of these may be sold

CALLAWAY-—Ely Callaway, one of our best
wine-making friends among California wine-
makers, was, until recently, President of Burl-
ington Industries. Being a pioneer by nature,
he did not seek out vineyard land in the famed
Napa Valley, but diseovered the climatic vir-
tues of the high hills northeast of San Diego.
It is his wine that is the talk of California be-
cause he has succeeded in such noble fashion.

CHAPPELLET-— Don Chappellet gave up a
multi-million dollar successful industrial firm
in Los Angeles. The reason—he took his wife
and six youngsters to a rambling ranch house
high on Pritchard Hill, overlooking Napa Val-
ley, to hopefully make the best wine in all of
California. Comparative tastings indicate that
he is well on his way to achieving this goal.

CHARLES KRUG—Charles Krug escaped the
1848 German revolution and transported him-
self to California to start in Napa Valley in
1858. It was the first commercial winery in
Napa Valley. Cesare Mondavi, an Italian who
left the Minnesota iron mines, acquired and
improved the vineyard during the ’20s. His
good work was carried on by his sons, Peter
and Robert (Robert departed to create his own
Robert Mondavi vineyard about ten years ago.)
The best of their wines are listed below.

wine cellar (it will be fun doing this), and—like Christopher Columbus—you will
discover a new world—not of land, but of the grape. HAPPY TASTING!

CHATEAU MONTELENA~!t was the Cha-

teau Montelena Chardonnay that beat out in
Paris the Montrachets of France at a blind
tasting conducted by Stephen Spurrier. The
Zinfandel and Johannisberg Riesling are also
at a prize-winning level.

in Napa Valley, comes some of the most re-

markable wines of the area. This is particularly
