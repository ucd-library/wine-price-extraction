 

DOMAINE CHANDON-tThe largest, the most
prestigious Champagne grower in France is un-
doubtedly Moet & Chandon (Moet-Hennessy
group). However, the French Champagne dis-
trict is a delimited area and there simply is no
land remaining to provide expansion to a large
firm dedicated to growth and excellence. The
Moet Board arrived at a logical decision—let
us find the best vineyard land in Napa Valley,
then acquire the choicest grapes, import the
Moet Champagne-making skill and proceed to
match the excellence of French Champagne on
American soil.

Michael and Sam Aaron just returned from
spending three days at the Moet installation,
a quest of John Wright, the man who directs
this amazing showplace enterprise. In Cali-
fornia everyone is clamoring for Domaine
Chandon and everywhere, from San Diego to
San Francisco, it is being doled out by the
bottle. The wine is dry, excellent, ages on the
imported French yeast. The bottles are turned
daily by Frenchmen imported for this purpose.
When will this noble sparkling wine reach
New York? Because of limited production, it
will not arrive in our cellars until November.
However, now is the wise time to order it so
you can be among the ‘first on your block’ to
taste Chandon Napa Valley Brut.

DRY CREEK VINEYARD — Dry Creek is a
blessed valley in Sonoma County. Sonoma Val-
ley is proud of the wine they produce and re-
cently ran a two-day blind tasting Fair. Among
the judges were Frank Prial and Burgess Mere-
dith. It was the Dry Creek Zinfandel 1975 that
won the Gold Award as the best Zinfandel
produced during that vintage in Sonoma. It
was also Dry Creek’s Cabernet Sauvignon 1974
that won the highest award in its category at
the Fair. Their whites are also outstanding—
the winery is beautiful and approximates a
chateau in the Medoc in appearance. We sug-
gest you visit it when next you go to the
California wine country.

FICKLIN — Walter Ficklin is an imaginative
pioneer. In an area of lesser wines, not far from
Fresno, he planted the best of the Portuguese
port grapes. It is the only fortified wine pro-
duced in America that can truly compete with
its European counterpart.

FIRESTONE VINEYARD - Brooks Firestone
and his father, Leonard K. Firestone, estab-
lished this showplace vineyard in Santa Ynez
Valley, not far from Santa Barbara. The Leg-
endary André Tchelistcheff is the wine-maker.
Knowledgeable Californians believe that the
Firestones are making some of the best wine
in their State. Since the Cabernet Sauvignon,
Pinot Noir and Chardonnay will be scarce, we
suggest you order them now, even though you
will not receive delivery immediately.

that we offer them to New Yorkers.

HOFFMAN WINERY-A miracle took place
here. André Tchelistcheff, the wine consultant,
believes that some of the best Chardonnays of
California will ultimately be produced in this
area particularly in the rugged Santa Lucia
Mountains. The wine-loving proprietor is Dr.
Hoffman (assisted by his two sons, David and
Michael), an eminent cardiologist, who insists
on producing the best his soil can yield regard-
less of cost; and without regard to the loss he
somtimes suffers by selling off lesser grapes
in order to achieve the highest possible quality.
The winery is not too far from the Firestone
vineyards—these two vineyards indicate clearly
that great wine can be produced in the hills
that tower above Santa Barbara.

KENWOOD — Robert Daley, the man who
wrote those wonderful articles about Chateau
Gloria and the First Growths, believe it or not,
was once Deputy Police Commissioner of New
York City. Martin Lee, the proprietor of the
Kenwood vineyards, was once one of San
Francisco’s most beloved police officers. It is
Martin Lee’s tradition of honesty and direct-
ness that is reflected in these utterly delightful
red wines. The wine is matured in small oak
cooperage with strong emphasis on the reds.
It is a tiny vineyard—the prices are low and
will go up—now is the time to experience them.
