 

1971 RED BURGUNDY

A fabulous, extraordinary year yielding some
of the greatest Burgundies of the decade. They
are long-lived so you can look forward to
further development in your own personal
cellar. Perhaps the greatest cache of Grand
Cru 1971 red Burgundies has been resting in
the cool, impressive cellars of Bernard Grive-
let. Thanks to Grivelet’s interest in the Ameri-
can market and his spirit of generosity, a few
cases each of his noblest 1971 red Burgundies
have reached us. We offer them below on a
first-come, first-served basis.

Bottle Case
CHAMBOLLE-MUSIGNY ...... 7.69 87.70
Some of the most charming, vibrant, and fra-
grant of all red Burgundies are produced in the
420 acre village of Chambolle-Musigny. Here
is an estate-bottled beauty from Desvignes.
(#389)
CHAMBOLLE-MUSIGNY,

LES VIGNES DU CHATEAU.. 7.99 91.10
Bernard Grivelet owns some of the best land
in Chambolle-Musigny and this particular
wine represents his proudest efforts. (#655)

VOSNE-ROMANEER 25 50-0. -< 7.99 91.10
In the village of Vosne-Romanee one can find
such vineyards as Romanee-Conti, Richebourg,
and La Tache. Grivelet’s vineyard land is only
a short stroll away from these blessed spots.
Bernard Grivelet. (#654)

BEAUNE CENT VIGNES....... 7.99 91.10
The best of Beaune represents extremely high
quality. There is no better vineyard in the land
surrounding this picturesque little city than
‘Cent Vignes.’ Balance and grace are the dis-
tinguishing characteristics. Estate-bottled,
Monnier. (#431)

GEVREY CHAMBERTIN ....... 8.39 95.65
We like Moillard because once, when Frank
Schoonmaker and Sam Aaron were vineyard-
hopping, it was the good Moillard family who
put them up and fed them. They are not only
noted for their generous spirit but also for the
superb quality of their wine. This 1971 will
prove it. Moillard. (#476)

CEOS VOUGEOT. .. 222.3 .. 8.49 96.80
The largest vineyard of Burgundy was estab-
lished by Cistercian monks in the 12th century.
The production averages 10,000 cases and the
Grivelet production is among the best because
it comes from some of the choicest land. (#656)
CHAMBOLLE-MUSIGNY,

[es GCHARMES 222.2525 0.52% 8.49 96.80
As good as Chambolle-Musigny is, when you
select a Grand Cru vineyard within the vil-
lage’s confines such as ‘Les Charmes,’ you are
exalting the already exalted. Bernard Grivelet.
(#589)

WOBNE-ROMANEE: =. .i 2-2... 9.79 111.60
We told you how indebted we were to the
Moillard family when we discussed Gevrey
Chambertin. The Moillards have made us even
more indebted to them by sending us this
superb Vosne-Romanee 1971. (#482)

BONNES MARES 7... 2... 2... 9.95 118.00
Bonnes Mares is situated between Chambertin
and Musigny, exhibiting the power of Cham-
bertin and the finesse of Musigny—although in

a bit lower key. Bernard Grivelet. (#601) hf

POMMARD EPENOTS......... 9.95 118.00
There is more ‘Pommard’ sold in the world
than Pommard has ever produced. Its easy-to-
pronounce name has made it popular in the
English-speaking world. The trick is to get one
of the better vineyards to experience what true
Pommard can be. There is no vineyard other
than ‘Rugiens’ to compete with the stature of
Epenots. Bernard Grivelet. (#160)

CHAMBERTIN, CLOS DE BEZE.12.50 142.50
Chambertin is 32 acres; Clos de Beze is 37
acres. Either is entitled to call itself ‘Cham-
bertin’ but only Clos de Beze has the right to
add the suffix Clos de Beze. At least Chamber-

tin’s equal but often better. Bernard Grivelet.

THE GREAT
1975 WINES
OF GERMANY

We quote the leading spokesman of the
German wine industry, “While we are ex-
tremely excited about 1976, because of the
‘Vintage of the Century’ proclamations that
have appeared about 1976 in the world press,
we should not too quickly forget about the out-
standing year 1975 ...a year that, until the
explosive rave notices of 1976 appeared, was
also considered a ‘Vintage of the Century.’
1975 is a year of perfect harmony, without the
dramatic sweetness of 1976, and a year already
acknowledged throughout the world as wines
of amazing elegance, happy harmony, perfect
balance and bouquet as well as all the har-
monious signs of unique longevity.”

Gerald Asher, Wine Editor of Gourmet Maga-
zine, confirms this by reporting “let us be
grateful for the wonderfulness of 1975, even
though it does not quite compete with 1976 in
such factors as the high ratio of sweet Ausle-
sen, Beerenauslesen, and Trockenbeerenausle-
sen.” In summary, to accompany lunch or din-
ner where one does not normally prefer exces-
sive sweetness and fruitiness, choose the great,
great 1975s; however, when a situation calls
for a rich, dramatic, flowery dessert wine (or
when one drinks a wine by itself simply for
the joy of it), choose 1976. (We have prepared
the largest list of great 1976 Rhines and Mo-
selles available anywhere in the U.S. Write or
phone for your free copy. By buying 1976 now—
for delivery this summer—you will enjoy sub-
stantial savings and the pleasure of full selec-
tion.)

Wonderfully delicate and fragrant, fruity. De-
lightful to serve as a Summer aperitif or with
soda as a ‘spritzer.’ Otto Dunweg. (#668)

ZELLER SCHWARZE KATZ.... 2.99 34.75
Schwarze Katz means ‘black cat’—the hand-
some pet that dominates the label. Here is a
Spatlese—the best Zeller wine you have ever
tasted. Reis. (#579)

WILTINGER SCHARZBERG

SPAVELESE. 23) i 3.49 39.80
Not to be confused with Scharzhofberg which
it adjoins. Grown in the town of Wiltingen,
whose vineyards overlook the Saar River. A
happy combination of fruit, dryness, and aus-
terity. Zentralkellerei. (#599)

ERDENER TREPPCHEN

KABINE TA) 07 euy es oP

GRAACHER HIMMELREICH

KA BINED) oc ee ca 3.99 46.75
Graach is a tiny Moselle town situated be-
tween Bernkastel and Wehlen. Shares the same

more famous neighbors. A bit lighter and less
overpowering than the Webhleners, but of equal
distinction. Estate-bottled, Sebastian Prum.

1975 MOSELLE (Continued)

OCKFENER BOCKSTEIN Bottle Case

WABINEVL TD seca 3.99 46.75
Ockfen boasts of the dramatically steep vine-
yard that bears the name ‘Bockstein’—one of
the great dry white vineyards of the world. In
a great year such as 1975, they are remarkable
and worth whatever they cost. Frank Schoon-
maker states, “White wines unsurpassed by
those of any other German or French vineyard,
and therefore in the world. Very light, almost
steely, elegant with a bouquet that can only be
called incomparable.” 1975 is a great year;
Dr. Fischer is the best grower. Need we say
more? Quantity limited and rationed. (#643)
WEHLENER SONNENUHR

MADINE TT Gos ee ae 3.99 46.75
There are four or five different growers who
are part of the Prum family, each bearing the
name ‘Prum’ on the label. German wine experts
consider Johann-Joseph Prum and Sebastian
Alois Prum far and away the best. Wehlen
boasts of the best vineyards in all of Moselle.
Estate-bottled, Sebastian Alois Prum. (#582)
BRAUNEBERGER JUFFER

RABINET (6223 i ae 4.49 51.20
Thomas Jefferson, an enthusiastic wine lover,
visited Brauneberg and proclaimed it his fav-
orite Moselle. Today, these wines are not as
fashionable as in the days of Jefferson, but no
less admirable. Full-bodied, fine and rich.
‘Juffer’ is the best single vineyard of all
Brauneberg. The leading producer is acknowl-
edged to be W. Haag. Will add stature to your
Summer entertaining. Estate-bottled, W. Haag.

(#646)
BERNKASTELER SCHLOSSBERG
SPATLESE 5 53 cc dota 4.79 54.15

The astonishingly high-priced ‘Doktor’ is un-
doubtedly the most famous vineyard in Bern-
kastel. It was this wine that saved the life of
a dying Bishop and its health-giving virtues
are sometimes attributed to the word ‘Doktor’
that appears on the label. Here we offer the
‘Schlossberg’ vineyard which we consider even
better. Surely it is not capable of providing
medical miracles but it can offer you wonder-
ful fruit, great breed, sufficient acidity to pro-
vide dryness, and much finesse and character.
Since jt sells for one-quarter the price of
‘Doktor,’ we suggest you try it to satisfy your
curiosity and please your palate. Estate-
bottled, Pfarrkirche. (#649)
PIESPORTER GOLDTROPFCHEN

AUSLESE® ‘pseu: Ate ty 4.89 55.75
1975 is a glorious year; its ‘Auslesen’ usually
commanding over $100.00 the case. Here is an
‘Auslese,’ estate-bottled by Lehnert from the
exalted ‘Goldtropfchen’ vineyard. This, like
the others, would be good value at $100.00 the
case. (#651)
URZIGER WURZGARTEN

SPAVTEESE 3 ee 4.89 55.75
Another example of ‘Spatlese’ below $75.00
the case. There are only 110 acres of terraced
vineyards in the entire village of Urzig.
Sprightliness and spiciness are the distinguish-
ing characteristics. Wurzgarten is its best vine-
yard. Zentralkellerei. (#653)
ZELTINGER HIMMELREICH

IWATBIINESD DE ie ee 4.99 56.90
‘Himmelreich,’ in the vineyard town of Zelting,
is considered one of the best eight vineyards
of all Germany. The black-slate mountainside
(too steep to be called hillside) has an admir-
able south-western exposure. Like Brauneberg
Juffer, it is the fullest-bodied of the fine Mo-
selles. Estate-bottled, Friedrich Wilhelm Gym-
nasium (a famous secondary school in Trier,
the vineyards being bequested over the years).
(#673)
JOSEPHSHOFER KABINETT... 5.29 60.35
‘Josephshof,’ the supreme vineyard of Graach,
is owned in its entirety for over a century by
the Kesselstatt family. It adjoins Wehlen and
its wine, sold as Josephshofer, is generally
more like a Wehlener than a Graacher. Big and
fine, rather than delicate and charming. Estate-
bottled, Reichsgraf von Kesselstatt. (#679)
