FIESTA OF ITALIAN WINES

BOLLA SOAVE is the most sought after and charming of all Italian dry white
wines. There is hardly a good Italian restaurant in America that does not feature
it. Served icy cold, its brightly, crisp dryness will enhance any seafood or chicken
dish you may serve at the beach, on a boat, on a terrace or in a New York

apartment. Buon’ estate!

BOLLA VALPOLICELLA is a favorite of James Beard, America’s leading food
and wine authority. He states “Valpolicella is the kind of red wine that comes into
its own in the Summer. Served cool, it is the ideal accompaniment to hamburgers,
lamb chops and steak as it comes sizzling off the grill. Its fruity, light, refreshing,
thirst-quenching qualities are ideal for the warm weather repast.”

Although we are dealing with two of Italy’s better wines (they are not the average
Italian wines, but Bolla) the price is modest. Why not buy a case or two?

Fortify yourselves against the Summer sun — buy a case a both for only $38.78 each.
