— Squeezed between the publicized ’47s and ’49s. The
true merit of this year were not recognized until re-
cently. These two “First Growths” are worth double
the price in terms of what they taste like after the cork
is drawn.

_Heads are bowed when ‘1947’ is mentioned.
Bordeaux experts consider ‘Cheval Blanc 1947’ the
greatest single claret extant, and it is amazing that any
escaped to America.

_ Chateau Latour 1945 is one of the noblest Bordeaux
jewels of the century and still has at least two decades
of glorious life ahead.

— A good, but not great year. Ideal selection for those
who want a ‘three-decade-old’ claret at relatively
modest cost.

LALANDE (Pauillac) ....

_A firm, tannic year that has been unattractive for
over two decades, but now softening and becoming
glorious.

Haut Brion and Latour are great and classic — the
Desmirail has lost its vineyard identity and has be-
