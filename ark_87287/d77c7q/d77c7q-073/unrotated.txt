 

In a recent issue of House Beautiful, Frank Schoonmaker states, “Even leaving
price out of consideration, there are, for my taste, no red wines in the world so
fairly comparable to the best of France as the best Riojas.”

In the readable, reliable book, “Wine,” Hugh Johnson states, “If I were asked
what I think is the best value for money of any red wine in the world today—I
would say Rioja, one of the old Reservas—wine fifteen or more years old—but
which wine merchants persistently ignore.”

In the glorious tome entitled “Sherry and the Wines of Spain,” George Rainbird
comments, “The fine wines of the Bodega Federico Paternina are appreciated all
over the world... the bodegas best known wine is the tinto ‘Banda Azul,’ which,
I suppose, would be about 4 years old and is uniformly good—and a real giant of
a wine is ‘Gran Reserva,’ some bottles having a label reading 1928—it can cer-
tainly be recommended as a hig wine.”

And when Frank Schoonmaker told us of the visit of Ernest Hemingway to the
Paternina cellars, we instinctively understood that Mr. Hemingway’s appreciation
of honest, basic and flavorsome red wine must have impelled him to seek out the
Paternina cellars—certainly among the best in all Spain.

673 BANDA AZUL TINTO 1964 (Rioja)........ 1.49 16.10

Ernest Hemingway visited the cellars of Paternina and enjoyed its lusty, flavor-
some red wines enthusiastically. He was accompanied by the famed bullfighter,
Ordonez, during his stay. We are dealing with honest red wine here, rich in
flavor, of good bouquet, and remarkably low priced in relation to its quality.
Frank Schoonmaker concurs with this judgment.

527 GRAN RESERVA: 1955-2 a 2.99 32.30
Frank Schoonmaker recently visited these Paternina cellars. He was amazed at
the quality of this authentic 1955. We do not think you can find a better wine
at double the price from France.

670 GRAN RESERVA 1949 (Rioja)............ 4.99 53.90
As in Bordeaux, 1949 was a great year in Rioja. After all, they are only 250
miles apart and they shared the same superb weather. Great now—and with 10
good years of vitality ahead of it. From the private reserve of Paternina.

456 GRAN RESERVA 1947 (Rioja)............ 5.99 64.70
The outstanding 1947 clarets command about $200.00 a case in Bordeaux. Our
tasting notes read “classic—remarkable bouquet, well-balanced, sufficient tannin
to indicate longevity. Canecompete with fine old clarets.” Frank Schoonmaker
considers this probably the best red wine procurable in all of Spain.

dry, and excellent white wine for summer drinking.

Here is the equivalent of a German “Auslese,” with a high proportion of over-ripe
grapes, which gives it its dramatic, sweet, flower-like bouquet and flavor. It can be
compared to Chateau d’Yquem in taste qualities, but costs less.

 

During this time of year, American tourists are occupying every peak of the Swiss
Mountains. They come back with enthusiastic affection for the wonderful dry white
wines produced there. Generally, they believe they taste better in Switzerland.
We decided to do something about it by bringing in the very best dry white wines
of Switzerland—from the small Estate-bottlers that consistently win Gold Medals
for the quality of their wines. They may cost a bit more, but here is a collection
that represents the best vinicultural efforts of the dedicated Swiss wine growers.

wine comes.

its French ancestry. One of the best reds of all California.
