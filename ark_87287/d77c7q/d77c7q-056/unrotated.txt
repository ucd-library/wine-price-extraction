The ‘tastevin’ or ‘silver tasting
’ represents the warmth and
| itality of Burgundy.

Only last week, we took a bottle of
Ponsot’s Clos de la Roche 1966 from
ur cellars and tasted it. In the com-
nany of objective wine authorities,
the universal verdict was “‘one of the
greatest red Burgundies we have
ever tasted, regardless of price.”
nd M. Ponsot claims his 1969 1s
even better! Our advice is to acquire
: vy bottles of the 1966 while we
have them—judge it—and if
ju agree, reserve a Case of his 1969.

Jean Ponsot, unlike most of his
neighbors, sticks to old-fashioned
methods and simply refuses to de-
tem when vinifying his wines—the
result is that they are big, deep
tannic, slow-maturing and excep-

ally long-lived. This is not only

ie for Clos de la Roche, but also

for his other vineyard holdings in

NOBLE indeed are the wines vini-
fied by Prince de Merode, the cousin
of King Baudouin of Belgium. His
love of the soil and its wines matches
despite his regal background, the af-
fection of his farmer neighbors.
The Merode holdings are in the very
best ‘Téte de Cuvée’ vineyards of
Aloxe-Corton, crowned by the king
of them all—Corton, Clos du Roi—
which does not deign to bow its head
in deference to any other Cru of the
entire Cote d’Or. The Aloxe-Corton,
comes from ‘Premier Cru’ holdings,
and is superb. Here we are dealing
with the longest-lived wines of the
Cote de Beaune, exhibiting extraor-
dinary breed and texture, amazingly
silky and beautiful balance—the
best since 1961. Delivery — Spring
1971.

Mr. Lamarche is to the wine world
of Burgundy what Alfred Knopf is
to the publishing world—an uncon-
tested symbol of uncompromising
excellence. His holdings in the great
vineyards are astonishing—his cel-
lars wind their way, cave after cave,
under half the town of Vosne-
Romanée. Just gaze at the names
shown below — they are emperors
among wines.

 

Tasting in the cellars of Henri
Lamarche.

And the crowning jewel of them all
is the tiny 3.3 acre corridor known
as ‘La Grande Rue’ which séparates
La Tache and Romanée-Conti. All of
Mr. Lamarche’s wines are long on
finesse and style, as the good wines
of Vosne-Romanée should be, and
are destined to mature with elegant
grace. They can be considered among
the noblest wines being produced in
Burgundy today.

M. Vocoret broke new paths
Chablis—the first man to introduce
qa tractor in 1952—the courageous
soul who introduced heaters in
vineyards to mitigate the disastrous
effects of Spring
such terrible toll atop the high hil
of Chablis. His efforts did not in
rewarded, because he was elected
Mayor of Chablis in 1966.

and are so outstanding that
have become a showplace in

a nugget—the best single wine that
Matrot produced during the 1969
vintage. It comes from the choicest
part of the 69 acre Charmes Vine-
yard, and is surpassed only by the
expensive, great, rare white wines
of France. Green-gold in color, full
bodied, dry, and with sufficient bal
ance to carry it through the nex
decade.
Matrot bottles early so that the
wines should be here in New York
by December.
