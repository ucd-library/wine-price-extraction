 

The 1964 red Burgundies, among the best and most enjoyable of our
time, have been resting in our cellars now for over four years. Suffi-
cient bottle-age has been acquired so that even a modestly qualified
wine lover can appraise the year and recognize its virtues.

It became quite apparent after the 1964s had been tasted—that they
are rich in fruit, well-balanced, enjoyable today and endowed with
sufficient depth and staying power to indicate quite clearly that there
still remains a goodly number of good, glorious and satisfying years
lying ahead. Drink them today—or lay them away for the future,
whichever you do, you will make no mistake.

209 VOLNAY, CLOS CHAMPANS. 4.79 51.75

Estate-bottled by Marquis d’Angerville.

We shall never forget our visit to the friendly home of Marquis d’Angerville and
his charming wife. Here is the very wine that was served us at dinner and we
were intrigued by its velvety qualities, superb fruit, and fantastic amount of
finesse.

403 CHAPELLE-CHAMBERTIN . . 5.99 64.70

Estate-bottled, P. Damoy.

In a blind tasting, we put this remarkable wine up against several Chambertins,
and none of the competition surpassed it. A true jewel in the Burgundian crown,
priced at half its true value.

608 VOSNE ROMANEE, LES
WelCNOES 45 6 2 es so GD. T2900

This velvety, soft Vosne-Romanée, from the outstanding Reignots vineyards, is
grown and estate-bottled by the Domaine de la Romanée — the proprietor of
the tiny, but world-renowned “La Romanée.”’ Worth over $10.

199 CORTON BRESSANDES . . . 7.39 79.80

Estate-bottled, Prince de Merode.
A remarkable example of the heights that can be achieved by a dedicated grower
at this outstanding vineyard.

95: €LOs DE VOUGHOT :. <= = 739° 79.80

Estate-bottled by R. Engel.

Because of the size of Clos Vougeot — the largest vineyard in Burgundy — it
is important that the wine come from a choice section and is produced by an
impeccable grower. Here is an example of Clos Vougeot at its best.

829 CHAMBERTIN, CLOS DE BEZE 9.25 99.90

Estate-bottled, P. Damoy.

In A.D. 630. the Duke of Burgundy founded the Abbey of Beze. The monks
cleared the land and planted vines on the choicest 37 acres. Its reputation for
excellence now extends over fourteen centuries. It is not as well known as
‘Chambertin’ itself, but it is generally recognized as being at least its equal.

798 VOSNE-ROMANEE,
TA GHUANDE RUE. ... - 995 107.45

Estate-bottled, H. Lamarche.
If there is a better red wine produced in Burgundy, it surely would be hard to
identify or find. Truly great — at least a decade of glory ahead.

599 LA ROMANEE. ... . . 14.50 156.60

Estate-bottled, Domaine de la Romanée.

The 2.1 acre of La Romanée is separated from Romanée-Conti by a narrow foot
path. Despite the proximity, the qualities are individual and distinct. La
ee aah is a bit more robust, but what it gains in body, is relinquished in
inesse.

Estate-bottled by Comte de Vogue.

On one side of the slope the land is worthless — on the other side there is the
16 acre Musigny vineyard which brings prices of over $30,000.00 the acre.
Poverty and wealth exist side by side, not only in cities, but also in vineyard
land. None of this wine exists in the cellars, or in the hands of the importers —
Le cases remain and we are probably the largest holders of this 1964 in the

Only 15 precious acres! Many consider this the greatest single red wine produced
in France, and we are the last to argue the point. Very rare, irreplacable. Buy

We need merely invite you to pull the cork from a bottle of La
Tache 1963 and experience one of the most remarkable Burgundies
you have ever encountered. We happily report that the prices are
about half of the 1964 vintage, and for present drinking, we think
they show better than their more expensive successor. Even these
1963s will shortly join the ranks of the unaccessible because none
