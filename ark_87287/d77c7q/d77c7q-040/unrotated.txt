BorDEax

The regional red wines of the Bordeaux area can be outstanding, beautifully balanced, and represent some of the
best red wine value in the world. We know of no better examples than the five listed here — each eminating not
just from a district, but from a specific vineyard. Arriving first week in July.

Just as a symphony conductor must mix strings and brass to achieve harmony, s0, sometimes, a vineyard must cies
the lightness of one year with the heaviness of another year to achieve his wine harmony. Here are two examples
— one an excellent regional red —the other a superb chateau-bottled claret that was grown and bottled at Haut

Brion itself. Both will please you.

Don’t overlook 1965. They have matured quickly and are beautiful now. Both the Haut Brion and Latour are
amazingly fine and represent some of the best value in great red wine we have ever encountered. The Pichon is
a “sleeper” that should not be overlooked.

1964 is known as the year “rich in fruit and charm.” These wines have matured well — each comes from one of the
great vineyards of Bordeaux — and each is starting to exhibit its balance and stature.
