The Rt. Hon. Ern-
est Marples shown

entering the House
of Commons to par-

ticipate in a Par-
liamentary debate.

Do you have friends who like to adventure
and compare many different wines? Why not
send them this rack holding nine different
Marples wines? And, if you have an enthusi-
asm for wine, why not simply send one of
these racks to yourself?

We happily report that there is a saving in-
volved. The rack retails for $12.00, but we
charge you only our cost, which is $4.95.

If you consider the regular retail price of
$12.00 for the wine rack, and added the cost
of the nine bottles of wine, the total would
be $34.01. However, we are offering a special
price of $25.95 for the rack and its contents
—a savings of $8.06.

ean:

 

MIXED CASE OF
ALL 9 WINES—
10F EACH... only Caiplete wih

Wine Rack
If you wish 9 wines without the wine rack, simply deduct
$4.59 from the total — the net cost to you would then be —
$21.00.

No. Bottle Case
ae. ? BEAL JOLAIS@.... . . «: 2 Tee 20.25

The most popular and best loved wine of France at astonishingly low cost. Reached

new heights in disarming charm during the 1969 vintage. Not a commercial wine,

No an estate-bottling from one of the most respected growers of the region, Pierre
ulien.

289 BEAUJOLAIS VILLAGES ... 1.99 22.28

From one of the 35 outstanding villages of Beaujolais, with more depth, alcohol and
flavor than the more basic Beaujolais listed above. The proud estate-bottling of
Louis Coindard, a respected grower.

255,. MORGON«: . 2... 2 2g, eee

Slower to mature than other Beaujolais, and rather similar in its development
characteristics to its Burgundian neighbors to the north. Less fruity during early life,
but compensates by improvement with the passage of time. Estate-bottled, Henri et
Robert Cotillon.

ot.. DULIENAS 2c. + oie eee eee

A firm wine of unusual distinction, with excellent balance and fine texture. Estate-
bottled, Antoine Benas.

3070 FLEURIE, LA TREILLE . ... 2.49 26.96

We now turn to the personal vineyard property of Ruth and Ernest Marples, which
occupies some of the best land of the renowned commune of Fleurie. Amazingly
fresh, with much fruit and charm. Estate-bottled, Rt. Hon. Ernest Marples.

200; CHIROUBLES «= . . . 2: 4) “259 2a

It requires the persuasiveness of a Cabinet Minister to get any ‘Chiroubles’ at all —
the scarcest of all wines of Beaujolais. It is the very wine that is featured, at this very
moment, in the best bistros of Paris such as Allard, Bistro 121, La Bourgogne, Chez
Georges, Lyonnais and Chez Pauline. Get a case and relive the joy of Paris dining.
Estate-bottled, Simon Petit.

Burgundy has its Chambertin and Clos de Vougeot. Beaujolais has its “Moulin-a-
Vent’ — far and away the best red wine growing area of the Macon — and always
the most expensive. This wine will live long — at least eight years of fruit and
sturdiness lie ahead. The grower, Mr. M. Chantin, is rightfully proud of his estate-
bottled wine.

    
   
     
      
 
      
     
    
   
    
  
   
   
    
  
   
  
   
 
   
   
  
  
  
   
  
  
  
    
  
 
 
  
  
  
   
   
    
 
   
   
 
  
   
  

394. BEAUJOLAIS VILLAGES BLANC 2.19 24.21

Chateau de Chaintré is the proud 15th Century Chateau property of Ernest Marples.
The Chateau is a fairy-tale version of a castle and is surrounded by a picturesque
moat. Beyond the moat there are vines that produce a delightful white wine — dry,
fruity, fresh and delicate. For those who want to drink Pouilly-Fuissé and are pre-
pared to accept the expression ‘Beaujolais Blanc” on the label in exchange for a
saving of $12 the case — here is your ‘best bet.’ Estate-bottled, Chateau de Chaintré.

S07" POUILLYTUISSE ...-........ aoe 36.86
The price of Pouilly-Fuissé at the vineyard has almost doubled because the harvest
is half of normal. Estate-bottled Pouilly-Fuissé, in general, will be almost $5 the
bottle by the Fall. Good for another five years. An outstanding, dry, clean example
grown and estate-bottled by Jean Lacoste.
