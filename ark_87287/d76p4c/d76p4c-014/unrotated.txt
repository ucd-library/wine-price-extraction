Portrayed here are La Marquise and Le
Marquis de Roussy de Sales, looking
pleased about what they have gathered
during the difficult 1977 vintage in
Beaujolais. Those wines produced in
the flatlands of Beaujolais should be
avoided because of excessive acidity.
However, the grapes gathered on the
higher hillsides—the ‘Crus’ —suc-
ceeded beautifully, particularly in
Brouilly, at Chateau de La Chaize.
Among the hillside Crus, you will
discover sufficient fruit, which marries
with the acidity to provide the beautiful,
refreshing harmony which is typically
Beaujolais.

—a vineyard which
has won more gold medals than
any French estate-bottled wine
over the last ten years—is the
proud, estate-bottled wine grown

one of the
noblest and most highly regarded
vineyards of all Beaujolais. It has
consistently been the best selling
red wine in our history—everyone
loves it and comes back for more.
Our inventory was depleted during
most of November, but we happily
report a new shipment has reached
us in time to bring its fruity, arbor-
like delight to your

With extensive hillside vineyards in the village of Odenas, Chateau de La Chaize can
proudly call its wine ‘ , one of the nine individual ‘growths’ that year-in and
year-out produce the finest of Beaujolais. Unlike lesser examples, Chateau de La
Chaize Brouilly is not bottled immediately after the vintage, but in the Spring
following the harvest when the added barrel ageing has brought out its full potential
and unique longevity. In addition, the property has been in the same family for three
hundred years. The present is a descendent of
family (the confessor of Louis XIV) who founded the estate in 1676. That
generation to generation of the family remains dedicated to the excellence of its
wines, is witnessed by the 1977 Brouilly Beaujolais we have only now received.
