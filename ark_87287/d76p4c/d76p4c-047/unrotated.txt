PIPER HEIDSIECK CHAMPAGNE

 

Here’s one ‘case’ where
you do not have to pay
the Piper. Simply pay
us, and we will send a
‘case’ of Piper to you.

Piper Heidsieck is not
just one of the largest
of the Champagne
Houses of France—it
also holds top rank for
excellence. Their 1973
vintage is an efferves-
cent jewel. It is avail-
able at 16.99 the bottle,
183.50 the case.

For the economy-
minded, Champagne-
lover who still insists
On uncompromising
excellence, we recom-
mend the Piper Heid-
sieck Ambassadeurs
Brut at 13.99 the bottle,
151.10 the case.

 

 

There is a drinking
revolution going on in
the United States—
overwhelmingly to-
wards the pale and the
dry. Gin and Vodka have
become increasingly
popular as part of the
revolution. There are
no better examples
than those produced
by the distinguished
firm of Gordon’s.
(Their’s is the best-
selling gin in the world.)

For those who want to
give a useful, meaning-
ful gift, we suggest
sending a case of six
bottles of Gordon’s
Gin and six bottles of
Gordon’s Vodka.

Gordon’s 80° Gin is
available at 5.59 the
bottle, 67.08 the case.
Gordon’s 80° Vodka is
available at 4.85 the
bottle, 55.29 the case.

DOUBLE-MAGNUMS (equal to 4 bottles)
DOMAINE DE LA ROMANEE-CONTI

 

20B

We have long won-
dered what would be
the most exciting
and satisfying single
bottle of wine we
could acquire to em-
bellish our private
wine cellar. At last,
we have found the
answer. It is ex-
pressed in these
giant—and we mean

Giant—Double-Magums of the greatest of red Burgundies, those
produced at the Domaine de la Romanee-Conti.

Each bottle is equal to 4 regular bottles—each is of the great,
great 1971 vintage—each, because of the large size, will enjoy at
least 25 years of development ahead. Not many of these precious
bottles have reached us. They will go fast. Can you think of a better
gift? Can you think of a better addition to your wine cellar?

offer.
