Here are some of the
best Sherries produced
in Spain from the ven-
erable house of J. M.
RIVERO, the oldest
Sherry firm in all Spain,
established during the
early 17th century.

No Bottle Case
1239 KIVEROS FINO JEREZ . «Ee ae eee
A light, dry, delicate wine; pale, straw-colored; the typical, unmistakable bouquet of a Fino, slightly reminiscent

of almonds. The aperitif wine of Spain, ideal with hors d’oeuvres, consommé, and shell fish. Serve chilled as an
interesting change from the dry Martini.

1236 RIVERO’S “TROCADERO” AMONTILLADO

A good Amontillado develops out of the Fino family. acquiring its own unique characteristics as it matures; the
color becomes more amber-like, the flavor more nutty. and there is more depth in body.

[238 ~“RIVERO'’S “CARRASCAL”’ CREAM

The richer and older of the Olorosos bear the name ‘Cream’ Sherry. This concept was developed in Bristol,
Fngland and Cream Sherries are extremely popular throughout the English speaking world, particularly in the
UL.~. Cream Sherry of age and character, medium dry and dramatically rich,

1240 RIVERO’S FINO MANTECOSO ah
The lightest of all sherries, dry, crisp, definitely an appetizer — a byword in Spain where it is also extremely
popular with the younger set.

1242 RIVERO’S TRAFALGAR 1805 (Solera Vieja)

Dark, golden sherry with great body, medium dry. A collector’s item, bottled from the original soleras established
with the barrels seized by the British at Trafalgar and bought back by Rivero in public auction at Tarifa in 1805.
Because the date ‘1805’ appears on the label and because the recipient will find this one of the most excellent
Sherries he has ever tasted, ‘TRAFALGAR 1805’ lends itself to being a most exciting gift to add a ‘sense of
history’ to the Yuletide festivities.
