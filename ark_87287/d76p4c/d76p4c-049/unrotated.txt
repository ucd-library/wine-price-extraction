Scarcely a wine-lover in America needs an introduction to Mr.
Alexis Lichine—one of the great and renowned wine experts of
the world. (Take a glimpse at his remarkable ‘New Encyclo-
pedia of Wines and Spirits’ if you need reminding.) Not all of his
enthusiasm and expertise is devoted to writing definitive
books, however—we present here beautiful proof of Lichine s
talent as a wine grower. Six bottles of his own elegant, delicate
Chateau Prieure-Lichine 1975 and six bottles of the illustrious,
rich Chateau Lascombs 1975 cradled in our popular James
Beard Wine Rack will make an especially fine gift for anyone
who loves the great wines of the Haut-Medoc. Both of these
top-flight grands crus from the famed commune Margaux will
provide years of dramatic wine-drinking pleasure.
