: SEW YORK, NUY,

Since 1934, the name on a bottle
of Scotch whisky has represented distinction,
sophistication, and an elegant harmony of all
of the elements that are necessary to create a
soft, light, and beautifully balanced whisky. Its
popularity—particularly for Christmas gift-giv-
ing—has not faltered until this day. (101.39 case)

If you like the taste of rich,
fruity, luscious melon—
here is the very essence,
captured beautifully by
Suntory and produced in
Japan. Serve chilled as
you would a good Fram-
boise. It will provide the
most refreshing of after
dinner liqueurs.
