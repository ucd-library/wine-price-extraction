CHAMPAGNES
OF
LOUIS ROEDERER

  
   
   
    
  
    
   
  
  
 
 

 

Louis Roederer is a small, quality-minded Champagne
House that concentrates on excellence in the bottle rather
than maximum sales. Its vineyard holdings of 430 acres
makes it possible for them to produce the wine from their
own grapes, rather than rely on purchases from neighboring
vignerons. In this fashion, the continuity of top-flight quality
can be maintained, whether it be Roederer’s vintage or non-
vintage Champagne. You will discover depth of flavor,
balance and superb bouquet.
