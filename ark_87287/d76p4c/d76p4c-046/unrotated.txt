Discovered in the Hills of Rioja

We tell a story to gladden the heart of
the wine lover. It is the story of the best
red wine produced in Spain—the tale of
Henri Forner, an important Bordeaux
wine grower, Spanish by birth—and the
wine miracle he performed in Spain.

Because of his uncompromising dedi-
cation to excellence in wine-growing,
Henri Forner is highly regarded in Bor-
deaux. He is the proud proprietor of two
of the noblest vineyards of the Haut-
Médoc—Chateau de Camensac and
Chateau Larose Trintaudon. M. Forner
had long been aware that when Bor-
deaux was devastated in the 1880’s by
Phylloxera, its more foresighted wine
growers Crossed the Pyrenées to con-
tinue their beloved craft in the favored
wine soil of the Rioja.

M. Forner had a dream — he was con-
vinced that if he applied the modern
wine-making techniques that he had
learned in Bordeaux, to the best soil of
the Rioja Alta he would be capable of
Producing wines that would match the
complexity and finesse of those he pro-
duced in the Haut-Médoc. To fulfill his
dream, he decided to take no chances.
Firstly, he employed, as consultant, the
famed Emile Peynaud, the foremost
O€nologist of the University of Bor-

19B

deaux. He also obtained the best vine-
yard land in the Rioja Alta region and
built a new bodega, the equal of any in
Bordeaux. He brought in the finest equip-
ment for cool fermentation. To assure
proper aging, he imported thirty million
pesetas worth of small oak
barrels.

When our tasting panel first tasted this
wine—a blind tasting—we shouted
“Eureka!” All five experts were aston-
ished by the wealth of fruit, richness,
balance, finesse and fine bouquet.

At $3.49 the bottle, $37.69 the case, the
discriminating wine lover is offered one
of the best red wine values currently
available in the United States.

Don’t overlook the dry white 1975 also
produced here at the Caceres vineyard.
Light, clean and dry, you will find ita
delightful experience at only $2.99 the
bottle, $32.50 the case.

Marques de Caceres represents an in-
triguing discovery for those wine aficio-
nados who want to wander off the well-
trodden paths that lead to California,
Germany and France.
