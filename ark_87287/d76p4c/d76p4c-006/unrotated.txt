The best-selling im.
ported Vermouth in the
United States is Martini
& Rossi—this is true of
their Red Sweet and
their increasingly pop-
ular Extra Dry. As a be-
fore-dinner drink, count-
less Americans serve
the red on the rocks.
Many prefer the ele-
gant, aromatic dry. And
others, in search of a
happy compromise,
pour them half and
half. A twist of lemon
adds zest and color.

Martini & Rossi is as
popular in the cafes of
Paris and Rome as Per-
rier Water is in New
York. Join the happy
aperitif drinkers! (39.95

Will make a much-appreciated gift. Note that it is
packaged in the handsome Eiffel Tower gift box—
the symbol of what France is all about.

The characteristics are
unique. Deep in flavor,
elegant, remarkable
bouquet and perfect bal-
ance. The Champagne is
called ‘CERTIFICATE’ be-
cause the House of Char-
baut follows the custom of
sending a hand-written,
numbered certificate to
those who acquire the
Champagne.
