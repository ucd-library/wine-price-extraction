P VERMOUTH
B GULLY PRAT 2

aa

France now sends us both the excellent
and the superb

Noilly Prat is the classic dry French Vermouth by
which all other Vermouths are judged. It is pale,
extra dry, of impeccable origin, and renowned
through the world. It is the ideal companion for the
Dry Martini — also excellent on-the-rocks with a
twist of lemon peel.

     
      
   
  
  
    
 
 
 
 
 
  

Its deligntful counterpart is the Noilly Prat Sweet
Vermouth from France. You will be delighted with
its fruity richness and beautiful balance.

The Christmas-New Year’s
period is the joyous time
when Champagne comes in-
to its own. For those who are
economy-minded, it must be
remembered that great spar-
kling wine is produced in
France outside the Cham-
pagne district. This Sablant
Brut proves it. Since the pro-
prietor is the distinguished
firm of Piper Heidsieck, all of
their Champagne skills were
brought to the Loire. You will
discover a beautiful harmony
of fruit and bouquet coupled
with dryness.

DE CAUSSADE
V.S.0.P. ARMAGNAC

 

ARMAGNAC comes from the
land of d’Artagnan—a land of
vines, geese, horses, Pyrenees
cattle, and spirited people—
in the tradition of the Three
Musketeers. MARQUIS DE
CAUSSADE is one of its lead-
ing disciples. There is a
respect in France for the ex-
cellence of fine, old Armagnac
brandy—rich in earthy flavor,
full-bodied and endowed with
delightful bouquet.

MARQUIS DE GAUSSADE
brandies are unique. They are
the proud distillates blended
harmoniously—and drawn
from the largest Armagnac
reserves that exist in d’Artag-
nan country. 22 separate age
ing cellars house the wonder-
ful black oak casks that are
hewn from the local forest. if
you like good, aged Cognac,
why not—for a change—tly
this MARQUIS DE CAUSSADE
VSOP. We know of no Cognac
at $10.98 the bottle that can

match it.
