NOW

For almost four decades, Sherry-Lehmann
has consistently sold wines and spirits to its
ever-growing clientele at the lowest pos-
sible prices. 1971 brings a special kind of
challenge to us, because inflationary pres-
sures have made many of our clientele cost-
conscious—and there is also a strong pos-
sibility that the New York State tax (at /east
12'2¢ the quart) on spirits may move up-
wards this Spring.

After careful investigation, our comparative
shoppers and our more price-conscious
customers are of the opinion that ‘dollar-
for-dollar’ the discriminating wine drinker
obtains better value, overall, at Sherry’s
than anywhere else in New York State. In
the area of spirits (whiskies, gins, vodkas,
etc.) prices fluctuate from store to store on
standard brands. We will not always be able
to offer the lowest rock-bottom prices in
New York for a Smirnoff Vodka, a Grant’s
scotch, or an Old Taylor Bourbon—but on
balance, we will provide outstandingly good
value.

TURN TO PAGES 26 and 27—on those pages
you will find superb spirits—the best within
their class—at dramatically low sale prices.
Most of these do not enjoy a giant advertis-
ing budget for imposing newspaper ads,
but, nevertheless, they are intrinsically
superior, will easily score high in any com-
parative tastings, and can be considered
serious candidates in assisting to balance
the family budget. If you are skeptical, we
suggest you try them. Based on our experi-
ence, it is most probable that you will come
back again and again.

We warmly invite you to visit us at our shop—
if this is inconvenient, please phone and we
will try and give you the same kind of well-
informed, friendly advice—whether in the
more practical world of Scotch, Gin, Bour-
bon, Vodka or Brandy—or whether it be in
the more elusive, fascinating and sensitive
world of chateau bottled clarets, Burgun-
dies, American wines, or other intriguing
wines produced anywhere on the surface of
the globe.
