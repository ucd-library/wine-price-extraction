There was much variation in quality from vineyard to
vinevard in the 1967 vintage. Here are some outstanding

examples of top-flight wines that 1967 produced.

Bottle Case
CHABLIS BEUGNONS.............-. 3.99 43.20
Estate-bottled, Simonnet Febvre. A ‘Premier Cru’ vine-
yard on the left bank of the river Serein. Dry, crisp.

CHASSAGNE MONTRACHET,

CE i ss GSES he 4.99 53.90

Estate-bottled, Ramonet. Frank Schoonmaker states in
his encyclopedia, “The Ruchottes vineyard produces one
of the finest white wines of France.”

BATARD MONTRACHET .......... 8.99 97.10
Estate-bottled, Morey. Very great and scarce.
MONTRACHET, LAGUICHE........ 19.88 214.65

Rabelais always referred to this wine as “the divine
Montrachet,” and Dumas proclaimed that ‘it should be
drunk kneeling and bareheaded.” The nobility of Bur-
gundy has no higher royalty than “le Montrachet,” gen-
erally considered to be the greatest dry white wine of the
world. The one produced by Marquis Laguiche is con-
sidered the ‘King’ even within this exalted company.

The Loire meanders for over 600 miles through France
and wine is grown along its banks from the Atlantic
Ocean almost up to Lyon. Because of the vast area, Loire
wines include a wide and interesting diversity of both
whites and reds ranging from the acceptable to the out-
standing. Here are the best.

ALSA

The choicest vineyards of Alsace are on the slopes of
the Vosges Mountains starting from Mulhouse continu-

ing north to Strasbourg. The Alsatian wines are usually
named after the grape from which they are made such
as Sylvaner, Riesling, Gewurztraminer, etc. Their dis-
tinguishing characteristics are flowery fragrance, rela-
tively dry, but fruity—at their best when drunk within
five years of the vintage.
