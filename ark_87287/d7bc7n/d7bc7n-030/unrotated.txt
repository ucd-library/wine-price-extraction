Rare, Irreplaceable
Vintage
From the

Last Century

Reid’s Hotel on the island of Madeira has now become the
sophisticated gathering spot of Britishers and Americans.
And when they return home, they speak glowingly of the
fantastic vintage Madeiras they experienced during their
stay—and how elated they are when they find that some
of the 19th Century Madeiras can be found right here in
New York at Sherry’s. And we now quote James Beard,
international food authority, “The very existence, let
alone the sheer perfection of these Madeiras, is an his-
toric wine event—these old Madeiras have provided one
of the great wine tasting experiences of my life.”

These rare Madeiras can be acquired well below their
world value during this sale period—NOW is the time to
buy them. When these are gone, the opportunity to taste
authentic old vintage Madeiras of this calibre will be
lost forever.

Rare 18th and 19th Century Solera Madeiras

The oldest Solera in existence are in the world. A 220-year slum-

lection of Joao Alfredo Faria, an important landowner of Funchal.

OLD VINTAGE

WHY BUY VINTAGE PORT NOW?

Firstly, they are on sale during this period; secondly, since they are
becoming greater in demand and scarcer with each passing year,
these vintage ports will either be unavailable or the prices will go
up fairly substantially by next Christmas; and thirdly, to obtain
authentic aged vintage ports, regardless of whether it be winter,
spring or summer, is quite a wine acquisition in its own right.

If you have not yet experienced the pleasurable wine-drinking joy
of vintage port that proudly bears the date of the harvest on its label,
we strongly advise that you try one of the noblest of the world’s
great wines—in its own way, in the same exalted class as a Chateau
Lafite, Haut Brion or a Romanee Conti. Whether it be in front of a
warming fireplace when the wintry gales are roaring outside, or
whether it be on sunlit terrace saluting the advent of spring, there

is always an honored place after the dinner party for noble vintage
port.

Regular
Vintage Grower Price
1944. NIEPOORT . 1 995 8.95

Not a fashionable year in Bordeaux or Burgundy, but it proved most
excellent on the sunny slopes of the Alto Douro.

1952 NIEPGORT. 2 >... oe 7.95

In a great year, a reputable port grower such as Niepoort, sets aside the
best of his wine to make his vintage port. Here is a glorious example.

1954 RICHARD HOOPER. .. .. 8.75 7.75

Richard Hooper was once the Lord Mayor of London, reflecting the
close relationship between Portugal and England.

1958 “SANDEMAN «> 7-3. 3 6.99

offered little scope for his talents and he went south to Oporto to seek
his fortune. He succeeded because Sandeman is now the most important
wine export firm of Oporto.

1960 QUINTA DO NOVAL .. . 6.50 5.85

‘Quinta’ in Portuguese means ‘agricultural estate’ or vineyard. The
Quinta do Noval, its steep terraces dominating the Pinhao Valley, is

fetch the highest prices on the vintage port market today. Here is a
giant that will thrive for several more decades.
