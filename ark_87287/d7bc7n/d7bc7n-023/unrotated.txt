THE WINES OF GERMANY

s MWAGNUMS = Equal to 2 bottles Hii

All wine experts agree that the best German wines are
superb, and are possibly among the best white wines of
the world. Even the less expensive ones are charming
and have finesse.

The latitude of the German vineyards extend as far north
as Labrador. Grapes struggle to survive, but when they
do, they are superb. The most important areas are the
vineyards that overlook the Rhine and Moselle Rivers.
We take these wines sufficiently seriously to offer you,
after many visits and tastings, those that we consider

the best of Germany.

1969 RHINE WINES

Some extraordinary wines were produced during this
excellent year on the higher hills that avoided the fog
that prevailed prior to the vintage lower down along the
river. We have made a selection below based on geo-
graphical position of the vineyard and our tasting notes.
These are truly outstanding and many can be laid down

for future drinking.

1969 MOSELLE WINES

During the 1969 harvest period, although the lower Rhine
was somewhat disturbed by fog, the Moselle Valley was
bathed in sunshine. The vintage can be called great,
producing fine, fruity and elegant Moselles—destined to
please and bring much tasting reward during the years
ahead. Now is the time to acquire these outstanding 1969
Moselles.
