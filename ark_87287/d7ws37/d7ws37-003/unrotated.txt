FIRST ARRIVAL OF GREAT VINTAGE
ST. MARCEAUX BRUT 1947

PE PO $5992 exe

fifth
Travelers to France have come back with glowing
reports of the great 1947 vintage. This offering marks
the first arrival from a world famous Champagne
house of this truly great Champagne vintage year.
The St. Marceaux Brut 1945 sells for $6.59 the bottle,
$71.17 the case — and yet we consider this the better
wine. In effect, this offering represents a saving by
comparison, of $18.25 the case. The wine is dry and
delightful now, but will improve further with added
bottle age. A unique opportunity for those who wish

to anticipate their Champagne requirements.

A Great Champagne Opportunity!

$ 49 Three great red wines from Bor-
deaux that are truly collector's

fitth items; and a Cognac of above

average merit at exceptionally

$ 5 250 a low cost.
