Bordeaux is the most important wine growing
district in the world. Here are produced the
classical red Clarets, growths incomparable in
delicacy, variety and individual charm. White
Bordeaux wines are headed by the leading growths
of Sauternes, natural sweet wines, of which
Chateau Yquem is the most celebrated. The
white Graves are excellent general service wines,
neither very sweet nor very dry.

War damage in Bordeaux was slight but stocks
were badly depleted by requisition, as well as by
shortages of labor, equipment and _ pest-control
materials. It is reasonable to expect that stocks
of great Bordeaux wines will be limited and ex-
pensive for several years to come.

RED WINES (CLARETS)

These splendid regional wines are imported ex-
clusively by us from T. Jouvet & Cie., Bordeaux.
Some of them have been reserved for us in pre-
war bottlings and we recommend them as the
finest of their types, suited to any table.

Owing to the extreme scarcity of wines which
limits the French people to a mere fraction of
normal consumption, exportable quantities of
these types of wines are negligible.

CLASSIFIED CHATEAU CLARET

Chateau-bottling is a guarantee of authenticity
but not necessarily of quality; a knowledge of
vintages and of the character of the individual
wines is extremely important. A modest Claret
of a great year is better than a Grand Chateau of
a poor year.

Although limited in quantity our offerings here
listed are unusual values in the present market,
selected only from the best vintages now avail-
able. With the cooperation of our Bordeaux con-
nections the prices represent outstanding values in
the current markets.
