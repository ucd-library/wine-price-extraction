We present an admirable assortment of these ex-
cellent wines from the renowned family of Cha-
poutier, the largest proprietors of classified vine-
yards in the Cétes du Rhéne. The red wines
are rich, fruity and full-bodied, with somewhat
the character of fine Burgundies, but possessing
a deeper color and a distinctive flavor. Hermitage
Blanc is one of the few truly great dry white
wines.

Rhéne wines are less expensive than Burgundies
of comparable quality, largely because they are not
as well known. In our opinion, no better values
exist in the wine world. Those in this list are
all estate-bottled wines, and we recommend them
with complete confidence.

Preference for individual brands of champagne
is somewhat a matter of taste — or habit — but
those produced for the English market are ac-
knowledged as the choicest selections. The Brit-
ish created the appreciation of dry champagnes,
and the drier the champagne, the better must be
the wine from which it is made as no syrup 1s
added to conceal defects. Hence, the finest wines
are reserved for the dry English cuvées.

We present, as our own specialty, Perrier-Jouét,
English Cuvée, Extra Quality, Extra Dry — the
accepted leader in the exacting London market.
Because of our direct relations, we can offer this
celebrated wine in America at prices which com-
pare favorably in today’s market.

Dry champagnes are perfection for a gala occa-
sion, splendid with fish and appropriate through-
out a meal. The less dry wines are particularly
pleasant with a light dessert.

Champagnes usually require seven or eight years
to develop fully and good ones will retain all
their vigor and fragrance for as long as twenty
years or mote.

Sparkling Saumur is made in the Loire Valley in
the traditional champagne manner, and compares
in Our opinion, with all but the great champagnes.
Although slightly less dry, it is low in acidity,
very fresh and clean and is ideally suited for
cocktails, champagnes cups or extensive enter-
taining. These are exclusively outs.
