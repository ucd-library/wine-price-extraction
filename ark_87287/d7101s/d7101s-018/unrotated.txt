1969 VINTAGE

Highly praised immediately after the harvest, the ’69s are
simply not in the league with the ’61s, 66s, and '70s. Neverthe-
less, a most acceptable year, producing excellent, slow-matur-
ing wines, particularly in the Médoc and Graves, witli slightly

lower quality in Pomerol and Saint-Emilion. The crop was half

the normal size.

Charming, fruity wines reaching their apex in Saint-Emilion,

harvest in the Médoc, drenching about half the vineyards. One
must choose carefully here. While awaiting the glories of ’66
and ’70, the 64s, which can be drunk now, offer much pleasure,
and will until 1980.
