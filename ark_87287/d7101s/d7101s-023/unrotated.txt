Loire at an eminently affordable price.

Enchanting, easy to drink. The ideal way to start the

cocktail hour or accompany a splendid shellfish dinner.
Debreuil.

SAUMUR-CHAMPIGNY ROUGE 1973 .... 2.49 29.88
Georges Clemenceau studied in the town of Saumur and
could not help but fall in love with its wines. This gen-
erous and softly scented wine is one of the best reds
produced anywhere in the Loire and deserves the con-
sideration of every serious wine drinker. Domaine de
l’Oratoire.

MUSGADET-SUR-LIE 1974 ........--+--- 2.79 33.48
‘Sur-Lie’ means that the wine never left the original bar-
rel and the contents were taken out from above leaving
the lees behind. This is a more costly and wasteful proc-
ess, but the result is that you get Muscadet with more
intense flavor. This beauty is estate-bottled by Chateau
Briace and won First Award in a blind tasting among
Muscadets that was held recently in Paris. Chateau de
Briacé.

ANJOU SAVENNIERES DRY 1973........ 2.99 35.88

from the pretty village of Savennieres is one of our per-
sonal favorites. du Closel.

istics that make the best Loire wines so appealing. At
$3.59 this Quincy, from the Caves of the Meunier family,
is among the best French wine values we’ve come across
in recent years. Meunier.

SANCERRE 1973 .....---- cee ter rete? 3.69 44.28
Crisp, fruity, stylish — no wonder this was one of the
favorite wines of Ernest Hemingway who would take it
‘crackling cold’ with him to Spain. Beauquin.

POUILLY BLANC FUME 1973........-.-- 4.29 51.48
The wines from the charming town of Pouilly-sur-Loire
have won the hearts of wine drinkers ‘round the world
with their classic, clean ‘smokey-white’ character. We
know of no better reasonably priced example than this
one from the distinguished Beauquin.
