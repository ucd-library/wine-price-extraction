HENNESSY BRAS D’OR

Hennessy is
synonymous with
Cognac for brandy
drinkers around the
globe. These wise
Ognac connoisseurs
have come to recog-
nize that every bottle
bearing the Hennessy
name contains an
Outstanding, civilized
spirit—at very fair
Price. We are dealing
here not with just any
Hennessy, but with
their glorious Bras
d’Or. Extra aging in
expensive white oak
barrels makes Bras
d’Or so special. Rich,
smooth on the palate;
perfumed, concen-
trated to the nose. A
much appreciated
Christmas gift. In
handsome gift box.

Gift Selections From

ALEXIS LICHINE

37D

 

Scarcely a wine-lover in America needs an introduc-
tion to Mr. Alexis Lichine—one of the great and re-
nowned wine experts of the world. (Take a glimpse
at his remarkable ‘New Encyclopedia of Wines and
Spirits’ if you need reminding.) Not all of his enthu-
siasm and expertise is devoted to writing definitive
books, however—we present here beautiful proof of
Lichine’s talent as a wine grower. Six bottles of his
own elegant, delicate Chateau Prieuré-Lichine 1971
and six bottles of the illustrious, rich Chateau Las-
combes 1970 cradled in our popular James Beard
Wine Rack will make an especially fine gift for anyone
who loves the great wines of the Haut-Médoc. Both of
these top-flight grands crus from the famed commune
Margaux will provide years of dramatic wine-drinking
pleasure.

Price for the twelve bottles and attractive
wine rack is only. ...7) = $89.95

Here’s a gay and festive idea for every wine-loving
friend on your gift list. Our own blue denim tote-bag
holding two pot-bottles each of Alexis Lichine’s Beau-
jolais 1974, Pinot Chardonnay-Macon 1974 and Rosé
d’Anjou. His Beaujolais is lusty and light-hearted:
popular Pinot Chardonnay from Macon is fresh and
dry; the deliciously pink Anjou Rosé is one of the best
grown in France.

Can you think of a more intriguing holiday present for
some lucky friend? The cost of all six pot-bottles in the
useful ‘Bread, Wine, and Cheese’ Bag is only $27.50
