THOUGH IT IS NOT FEBRUARY, MANY GIFT-
GIVERS ARE SAYING “WILL YOU BE MY

Ballantine?”

Why? Since 1934, the name BALLANTINE on a bottle of
Scotch whisky has represented distinction, sophistica-
tion, and an elegant harmony of all of the elements that
are necessary to create a soft, light, and beautifully bal-
anced whisky. Its popularity—particularly for Christmas
gift-giving—has not faltered until this day.

In light of its excellence, the price is modest enough.
