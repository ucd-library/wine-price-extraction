ROEDERER CRISTAL

Returns to America after
a lengthy absence

Louis Roederer of Reims makes some of the great Cham-
pagne of France. The essence of their work is expressed
in the sensational Roederer Cristal, a supreme achieve-
ment of the art of Champagne.

This holiday season, Roederer Cristal is once again
available in the United States. Since early in the year,
this noble wine has not been imported to our shores. We
take great pride in announcing to our Champagne-loving
clientele that Roederer Cristal, in its dramatic clear
crystal bottle, has arrived in time for giving as special
gifts and pouring at the most important parties.

Please order early since the first reimportation of this
widely acclaimed Champagne is quite small. Our supply
will soon be depleted. (279.45 case)

DISCOVERED IN PARIS —THE RAREST,
FINEST, AND MOST REMARKABLE
BRANDIES AND EAUX-DE-VIE OF FRANCE

When in Paris, art lovers are advised to go to the Louvre
—and brandy lovers to visit Jean Danflou on Rue Thabor.
We heeded this advice and found the most remarkable
treasure trove of Eaux-de-Vie, Armagnacs and Cognacs
we have ever experienced. There are few outstanding
gourmets in Paris that have not frequented the ‘brandy
boutique’ of Mr. Danflou.

We happily report we have brought the best examples
of his treasury to you—each the best within its class.
We urge that you send a bottle as a unique gift—we even
more strongly advise that you buy a bottle for your own
personal exploration and pleasure.
