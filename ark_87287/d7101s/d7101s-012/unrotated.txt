A NOBLE HOLIDAY DUET

Your choice of

BENEDICTINE or ‘B and B’

The cry of ‘Eureka’ filled the air about the year
1510 at a Benedictine monastery in Fécamp,
France. It was during that period that Dom
Bernardo Vincelli discovered the secret of
making ‘Benedictine’ which was designed to
fortify and restore the spirits of the weary
monks. Shortly thereafter, this delicious
liqueur found favor with Francis | who discov-
ered it when he passed through the region in
1534.

During the 19th Century, the formula fell into
the hands of Monsieur Alexandre Le Grand
and his family have since been trusted to pre-
serve the formula. The ecclesiastical iNscrip-
tion D.O.M., which means ‘Deo Optimo
Maximo’ still is carried on every bottle of both
‘Benedictine’ and ‘B and B’.

Note the delightful holiday wrapping. Historic-

ally and symbolically most suitable as a
Christmas gift.

MANDARINE NAPOLEON

Cognac flavored with
the sweetness and
fragrance of oranges
has become
acknowledged as one
of the great after-
dinner tastes (not to
mention all the things
you can do with it in
the kitchen). But wait.
The Belgians have
gone the French one
better—they have
taken a rich and fine
Cognac and infused
into it the delicious,
delicate flavor of
Oriental tangerines.
Sound a bit far-
fetched? Any doubts
of its worth are
dispelled upon one
sip of this truly
superb liqueur.
