lf you are a real Champagne lover, this may be the only page
of our catalogue that you want to read. We understand. It’s
difficult to stop looking at all those tempting bottles. For our
part, it’s more difficult still to imagine the holidays without the
magnificent Champagnes of Moét & Chandon. Their illustrious
wines make a serious claim to the summit of Champagne per-
fection. From the colossal Salamanazar—holding the equiva-
lent of a full twelve-bottle case of Brut Impérial—to the elfin
split of White Star Extra Dry, every style and every size is a
profound statement of Moét’s historic commitment to the con-
tinued excellence of the most famous wine in the world.

Here at the left is one of the grandest bottles of wine generally
available in the world today—a 270 oz. Salamanazar of Moét’s
elegant Brut Impérial—their beautiful, bone dry non-vintage
Champagne ($167.49 the bottle, one to a case). Next is an
irresistible magnum of what may be the world’s greatest
Champagne—Dom Pérignon. Caviar, foie gras, truffles, Dom
Pérignon—all expressions of gastronomic perfection ($52.89
the magnum). On the right are three sizes of Moét’s charming
“White Star’ extra-dry Champagne. For those who prefer the
Champagne less dry than ‘brut,’ this delicious wine is an ideal
choice ($9.99 the bottle, $5.49 the half-bottle, $2.49 the split).

All these bottles don’t tell the full story of the many superb
Champagnes of Moét & Chandon. We take distinct pride in
presenting below a full range of these celebrated wines.
