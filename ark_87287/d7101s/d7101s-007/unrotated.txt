RAPHAEL

The French have a phrase for it
—I’heure verte, that time of the
afternoon when a gentle sooth-
ing aperitif is served to relax
the mind and prepare the palate
for dinner. Golden, medium dry
Raphaél is among the most
pleasing of choices for this
wonderful moment of the day.

DRY SACK

This famed “Sherry in the Sack” may
just well be the finest all-around Sherry
produced in Spain. Rich and nutty,
moderately dry, its taste never fails to
please. A wonderful idea for aperitifs
before lunch or dinner. Another excel-
lent way to savor Dry Sack? — as part
of a fireside supper of cheddar cheese
and apples. Who says we can’t learn a
thing or two from English gastronomy!

Available in both fifth and 37% oz.
bottles. Dry Sack in either size makes
an excellent present. But don’t forget
yourself.
