BEAUJOLAIS VILLAGES 1974

Achieving and maintaining
renown as one of the great
wine merchants of Burgundy
is no mean trick. Louis Jadot
has done it for decades. A
taste of the 1974 Beaujolais
Villages he sends us gives
ample proof of his integrity.
Replete with heady fruit, re-
splendent in a bright purple
robe, this is truly a top-flight
Beaujolais—one from the
very successful 1974 har-
vest. Try drinking this slightly
cool — you'll imagine your-
self amid the lusty vineyards
themselves.

— Just Arrived —
ONE OF THE MOST FABULOUS
OF FRENCH WHITE WINES

The news is out, the wait
is over. Moét & Chan-
don’s celebrated still
Champagne has arrived
bringing its peerless fla-
vor and bouquet to eager
American connoisseurs.
Until recently, this extra-
ordinary white wine—the
non-sparkling pride of
the men who make Dom
Pérignon—could be
enjoyed only at the best
restaurants of France
and at its birthplace—the
classic Chateau de Saran
in the heart of the Cham-
pagne country. But
happily, a small, rationed
quantity of this arresting
wine is now available to
our clientéle. Chateau de
Saran — like Le Montra-
chet—represents the
highest expression of
French wine made from
the Chardonnay grape.
Please order early. Our
quantity is extremely
limited. 10.98 bottle
118.59 case

We quote from Frank Schoonmaker's Encyclopedia, “... gen-
erally considered the best vineyard, after Chateau Margaux
itself, in the commune of Margaux; one of the most consistent
and distinguished of the 2nd class growths.”

 

 

    
 

  
 
  
  

POLISH WODKA

Nobody knows more about
Vodka than the people of
Poland do. Their Wyborowa
Vodka is an experience, es-
pecially as the classic ac-
companiment to caviar. Try
