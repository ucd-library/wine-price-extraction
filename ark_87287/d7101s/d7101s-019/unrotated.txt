1962 VINTAGE

Overlooked at first, the outstanding qualities of the firm, well-
balanced, soft ’62s are beginning to be recognized. Good fruit
and fine bouquet have developed beautifully. If you can obtain
them, you will find them excellent for drinking during the next
few years.

WHITE BORDEAUX

Bottle Case

CHATEAU TIMBERLAY BLANC 1971 .... 2.39 28.68
Charming and fruity. Good distinction for so inexpensive
a dry white Bordeaux.
CHATEAU LES JUSTICES 1970

PeMUlGr nes)... oc ey A eee: teen es 2.99 35.88
An ideal inexpensive way to revive the elegant custom
of serving Sauternes with dessert.
CHATEAU CARBONNIEUX 1972 (Graves) 3.99 47.88
Perhaps the perfect dry white Graves. Fine flavor but at
the same time light and elegant.
CHATEAU VOIGNY 1969 (Sauternes)..... 3.99 47.88
Top-flight sweet white Bordeaux at an exceptionally low
price.
DOMAINE DE CHEVALIER 1968 (Graves). 4.49 53.88
Attention should be paid here. Domaine de Chevalier
Blanc is considered by many the best dry white Graves,
but a wine needing several years to mature. This bottle
is gloriously mature and utterly remarkable.
CHATEAU COUTET 1972 (Barsac) ....... 4.99 59.88
One of the great sweet wines of Bordeaux. Will become
a golden elixir when mature. Note low price.
CHATEAU BOUSCAUT 1971 (Graves).... 4.99 59.88
The renowned white wine of Bouscaut from a very suc
cessful vintage. Lovely bouquet.
CHATEAU CLIMENS 1970 (Barsac).....-.-. 7.49 89.88
Unsurpassed in Barsac—in fact, revival of d’Yquem at a
fraction of the price. Achieves the heady balance of
sweetness, fruit and acidity that few wines can match.
CHATEAU HAUT BRION BLANC 1971

(Gravés) 2 33. fa 17.95 215.40
Amazingly concentrated and deep. Holds a special place
among dry white French wines.
CHATEAU HAUT BRION BLANC 1967

(Graves) 5. a a 18.95 227.40
Has no serious contender as best possible dry white
Bordeaux for present drinking.
CHATEAU D’YQUEM 1967 (Sauternes). . .22.50 270.00
The greatest sweet wine in the world. 1967 produced
particularly noble wine at d’Yquem. Considerable saving
over last year’s price.
