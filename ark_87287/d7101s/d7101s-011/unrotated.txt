Our fathers often tell us of the excellence
and virtues of the Pre-Prohibition Bourbons
of their youth. We recently conducted a blind
tasting, matching the “20 Year Old Collec- —

tor’s Item” against two whiskies that were
distilled in 1913 and bottled in 1933. To
everyone’s surprise, the ‘Collector’s Item’
was chosen as the better. If you have friends
or relatives that truly appreciate rare old
bourbon, now is the time to acquire your

supply for your Christmas needs—because

 

the probability is that our limited inventory

will be exhausted before the end of the year.
