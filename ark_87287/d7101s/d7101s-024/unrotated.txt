SPAIN

There is more vineyard land in Spain than in any other country
in the world—less than 3% is Sherry. The best table wines are
from Rioja and some good ones are produced in Valdepenas.
Look for the vintage wines of Rioja which are among the best
values in outstanding red wine extant today. For those who
want good everyday red table wine of quality, don’t overlook
either the Marqués de Caceras or the Cune Clarete—both are

excellent.

WINES OF CHILE
