No. Bottle Case

702 LATRICIERES CHAMBERTIN ........--- 7.99 95.88
Any vineyards whose co-proprietor is Alexis Lichine
must make extraordinary wine. This neighbor of Le
Chambertin is an absolute jewel.

689 CLOS DE VOUGEOT...........::seeees: 7.99 95.88
Ever since its creation by Cistercian monks in the Middle
Ages, Clos de Vougeot has been synonymous with un-
forgettable wine. Only with great pride can we present
this venerable wine at so low a price. Domaine Daurois.

573 VOLNAY, CLOS DES DUGS............- 8.29 99.48
The best of vineyards, vintages and growers combine to
make this Volnay a genuinely splendid wine. Will live
for many years. Marquis D’Angerville.

488 CORTON BRESSANDES .........----:-: 8.49 101.88
Burgundy of great breed and depth. Not yet mature, but
even now hinting at its future magnificence.

1970 VINTAGE

Each of those three astounding vintages—1969, 1970, and 1971—
has its special characteristics. The 1970's are lighter than the
69s or '71s but exhibit a remarkable noblesse of fragrance and
savor. They are relatively quick-maturing for wines of such
character.

AO. EGHEZPAUX cies 3 oe ca ce ee ses 14.95 161.45
One of high nobility of Burgundy. Justly celebrated the
world over for its expansive flavor. Domaine de la
Romanée-Conti.

548 GHAMBERTIN: <% .. cs ee. rs ee ee: 16.59 199.00
Chambertin Camus may well be the ultimate expression
of this famous wine. Unsurpassed for its long-lingering
bouquet and richly concentrated flavor, Chambertin
claims a reputation second to none in all Burgundy.
Production was not large in this noted vintage, so we
were able to obtain less than we would have liked.
Please order immediately to avoid disappointment.

486 GRANDS ECHEZEAUX ............-+--- 17.95 193.85
Among the fullest, most complete of the Cote de Nuits
grands crus. Grands Echezeaux’s quality is evident by
the company it keeps—its nearby neighbors include
Richebourg, Clos de Vougeot, and Musigny. Domaine de
la Romanée-Conti.

506 ROMANEE ST. VIVANT ..........---:-: 22.50 243.00
Yet another of Burgundy’s best, adjacent to the quintes-
sence of the region, Romanée-Conti. Can you think of a
wine enthusiast who would not be thrilled to receive
some of this treasure? Domaine de la Romanée-Conti.

494 RICHEBOURG ...........----eeeeeeeeees 23.65 255.40
Here we are dealing with one of the greatest red wines
in the world. Until recently, the Richebourg of the Do-
maine de la Romanée-Conti commended nearly twice
this price. It is an exciting event indeed that we can
recommend this classic at such substantial savings.
Domaine de la Romanée-Conti.

495 Re TT AO roo oe sie wai 8 ee 26.50 286.20
Ah La Tache! Many connoisseurs prefer this aristocrat
to every other red wine in the world. An underlying
assertiveness gives its storied elegance an authority no
wine lover should ever miss. Domaine de la Romanée-
Conti.

OLDER
RED BURGUNDIES

With small and fragmented domains, Burgundy growers cannot
keep a stock of previous vintages in any way comparable to
the reserves of the large chateaux of Bordeaux. Thus these
older bottles are always hard to come by. We are fortunate to
be able to offer you here a few rarities, each one destined to
gladden the hearts of all who love fine old red Burgundy.

565 MUSIGNY 1966 .......-----ese esse ereees 24.50 294.00
Incomparable is the word for Musigny. Delicate and
feminine where its peers are dramatic and powerful,
Musigny is rightly renowned for a transcendent harmony
of complex flavor and generous bouquet that sets it apart
from every other regal Burgundy. This eminent example
from the highly regarded grower, Roland Thévenin, is
only now coming into its own.

542 RICHEBOURG 1966 ........---+++++-e-- 24.50 294.00
Whatever words we could add to Richebourg’s reputa-
tion would only be enfeebled by the quality of this ma-
jestic wine. Let it suffice to say that Charles Vienot’s
Richebourg 1966 ranks as one of the finest Burgundies
of our generation.

WHITE BURGUNDY

From Chablis in the north to Macon in the south, Burgundy
produces a range of distinguished dry white wines unequalled
by any other vineyard region on earth. Here are our recom-
mendations—everything from the freshest Pinot Chardonnay-
Macon to the richest Montrachet—chosen not only with an eye
for quality but with a vigilance for value.

1974 VINTAGE

First reports from Burgundy indicated a very spotty vintage,
demanding that wines be carefully selected. Many excellent
wines can be found. We think we have come across three of
them in these estate-bottled Chablis from Robert Vocoret.

410 CHABLIS = Go ea es 4.49 53.88
An excellent low cost example of this famous ‘flinty
wine.

436 CHABLIS, MONTEE DE TONNERRE..... 4.99 59.88

Here is one of the most popular of all the distinguished
Premier Crus of Chablis. Remarkable finesse.

427 CHABLIS, BLANCHOTS .........--+-+:: 5.99 71.88
Blanchots bears the exalted title ‘Grand Cru,’ a rank oc-
cupied by only six other vineyards. The pinnacle of
Chablis.
