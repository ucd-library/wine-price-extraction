Grown and Chateau bottled at Chateau Haut Brion. A
unique opportunity to acquire a claret of stature at
modest sale cost. At Chateau Haut Brion they now
follow the practice of segregating the grapes produced
from younger vines and then bottling the wines produced
under the name of Chateau Bahans Haut Brion. The
result is a wine of great breed, somewhat lighter than
Chateau Haut Brion, more quick to mature, and less

costly. Available in half bottles at 99¢ each, $21.95
the case,

CHATEAU LYNCH BAGES 1949 (Pauillac) 1.79
The full, deep color and pleasing balance of Chateau Lynch Bages is

apparent here. A unique opportunity to acquire a 1949 Claret of pedigree
and breed at astonishingly low cost.
