KESSELSTATT TREASURE CELLAR PUT IN THEIR FIRST NEW YORK APPEARANCE!

Whenever a vintage year in a Moselle is particularly outstanding (such as 1949, and now again 330
in 1953) the Counts of Kesselstatt set aside their most favorite wine into a special reserve

called the Schatzkeller or ''Treasure Cettar™.

It was the 1949 Piesporter Goldtropfchen that Chancellor Adenauer, a ''kenner'' of Moselles for

most of his seventy-nine years, chose as his favorite. In the opinion of our associate, Kenneth 317
Dean, who has just returned from an intensive tasting at Trier of the Kesselstatt Treasure

Cellar wines, the 1953 which is listed below may well turn out to have been the better one. In

any event, whether you, choose the Kaseler, the Piesporter or the Josephshofer, you may be sure

of one thing - you will be drinking some of the most extraordinary white wine of our generation,

 

No. Bottle Case 433
583 KASELER HITZLAY FEINE AUSLESE 1953 4,49 49.75

The steep vineyards along the Ruwer, from whence this remarkable Moselle

comes, produced wines which have their own flower-like distinction and

charm. Here is an extraordinary Auslese that is unquestionably one of the

most extraordinary Ruwer wines produced during a great vintage year. 378

595 JOSEPHSHOFER FEINE AUSLESE 1953 4.99 57.50
The Josephshofer vineyard, one of the giants of the Moselles, is entirely
owned by the Kesselstatt family. This 1953 is wholly remarkable, luxurious
and with a bouquet that is astounding.

589 PIESPORTER GOLDTROPFCHEN SPATAUSLESE 1953 4,99... 51.90 303
Here is a wine that won a national prize medal

competing against all of the German wines of the

magnificent 1953 vintage. Inthe opinion of Kenneth

Dean, it was the outstanding wine that he tasted during

his vineyard tour of the Moselle Valley only this August.
Piesporter Goldtropfchen is ranked as one of Moselle's five
greatest vineyards and here it is at its very best.

ALSATIAN WINES

400 FLEUR D'ALSACE (F. Hugel) 169 17.260 7
Here is a wine that is aptly called ''Flower of Alsace'' - made by F. Hugel,
the most famed of the Alsatian growers, it has the freshness, youth and
flowery charm associated with the wines of Alsace. 32]
444. GEWURZTRAMINER, GRAND CRU, 1953 (F. Hugel) 2.89 31.13 |
In our opinion, the best single white wine we have ever tasted from Alsace. Der
Here is an extraordinary 1953 that can hold its own with the great vineyards ee
of the Rhine.
