Bottle Case

From one of the best known of the Rheingau townships. A pleasant example

at modest cost.

RUDESHEIMER KLOSTERKIESEL 1952 (Fass #18) o.49. 21.95
Estate Bottled, Verwaltung de Staatsweinguter
A Rudesheimer of a great vineyard and great vintage year. Highly recommended
to those who want an authentic and fine estate bottled Rhine wine.

NIERSTEINER AUFLANGEN SPATLESE 1952 (Estate R. Senfter) o.99. 34, (5
One of the most perfect examples of Niersteiner we have ever tasted.

MARCOBRUNNER SPATLESE CABINET 1953 3.99. 40.75
Estate Bottled, Langwerth von Simmern
Full bodied, rich, and extraordinary 1953 from a vineyard generally
acknowledged as one of the best on the Rhine.

SCHLOSS JOHANNISBERGER AUSLESE 1953 3299: 460.75
Estate Bottled, Furst von Metternich
A collector's item. Very few cases of this precious Auslese remain.

OPPENHEIMER SACKTRAGER TROCKENBEERENAUSLESE 1953 8.95 100.00
Estate Bottled, Weingut Geschwister Schuch
This is the 'ne plus ultra’ of all German wines. A Trockenbeerenauslese or
dried berry selection' simply means that the wine has been made from
individually selected over-ripe grape-berries which have already begun to
shrivel and become raisinous. Such a wine can only be made in extraordinary
years and in the smallest of quantities. A wine of this calibre usually costs
over $20 the bottle and to drink it is an experience.

PORT
GRAHAM'S PICCADILLY TAWNY PORT Doe 19.99
GRAHAM'S POR | The firm of W & J Graham maintains high repute
RAHAM S PORT | in both Portugal and England for the qual ity of their
Dee ee Ports since 1784. Their most popular example is

eters

the medium full Piccadilly Port, a favorite among
the social clubs and hotels of London. Certainly, a
good value during April when it sold at $2. 87 - at
this unbelievably low price of $1.79 it is an offering
that cannot be ignored by anyone fond of good Port.
