Crate Lee Wines

Wine predates recorded history and is grown almost every-
where. If you are looking for the great wines of the world you
will not find them below. However, you will find—in an age of
spiralling wine prices—many good, satisfying examples that
will not make too serious a demand on the family budget.

The list below represents adventure in wine drinking. Did you
ever taste a top-flight Cotes-du-Rhone Rouge, wines from Yugo-
slavia, Chile, Bulgaria, Argentina, Rumania, England or Luxem-
bourg? Certainly, each of these represents an untried journey

971 CASTELO REAL ROSE (Portugal) ....... 1.59 17.50

The pink wines of Portugal are
emerging as the most popular among
the wine drinkers of America. Here
is an excellent Rose at a carefree
price.

 

972 BLANC DE BLANGS (Loire) ............. 1.59 17.50
Moderately dry. Delicious fruity white wine from the
Loire.

904 ELDERBERRY WINE (England) .......... 1.59 17.50
Remember ‘Arsenic & Old Lace’?

983 RODITYS ROSE (Greece) ............... 1.69 18.25

Wine played an important role in the ancient civilization
of Greece. We are not fond of Retsina, the resin flavored
wine so appreciated by the local population. However,
we are delighted with the Roditys Rose which is not far
removed from good French Rose.

1348 FU-KI PLUM WINE (Japan) 18 oz. ....... 1.79 19.95
> «a In France they use grapes; in Japan,
of plums and rice are utilized to make

663 COTES-DU-RHONE ROUGE 1970 ......-. 1.79 19.95

CRAIG CLAIRBORNE’S JOURNAL
calls it “excellent and the equal, we
feel, of the much better known and
neighboring Chateauneuf-du-Pape,
which it resembles.” We know of no
better value in good, honest French
red wine than this beautiful exam-
ple, proving how delightful Rhone
Valley red wines can be. Many of
our clients are buying this wine in
five case lots (60 bottles) and com-
ing back for re-orders. Why? Be-
cause five cases are available at the
special price of only $90—averaging
out at anly $1.50 the bottle. Why not
acquire a seasons supply, serving
good wine in your home, and save?

in wine drinking for many. There are hazards en route, but the
rewards will be great when you discover favorites. It is an
Odyssey worth undertaking. We have travelled the path and
have never regretted it—nor do we think you will.

In a world of complexity and seriousness, it is diverting and
‘sheer fun’ to experience some of the excellent but less serious
wines of the world—not endowed with fame and recognition—
but each with its own personal message.

965 MOUNTAIN NOIR 1966 (Minervois) ..... 1.79 19.95

With Corbieres, among the best red wine of the French
Midi. Full-bodied, well balanced. Awarded the V.D.Q.5S.
seal.

1348 FU-KI HONEY WINE (Japan) ............ 1.79 19.95
Japan is good at making ‘Sony’ and ‘honey.’

mao LAMBRUSCO (italy) :.. 665 since. 1.79 19.95
FUN-ITALIAN STYLE! Soft red wine, very fruity and
somewhat sweet. Leaves a tingle on the tongue. Serve
chilled.

966 MAY WINE (Germany) ..............-.-- 1.89 20.40
Dry Rhine wine flavored with the aro-
matic leaves of woodruff. Serve well
chilled, in a bowl, adding fruit, topped off
traditionally by strawberries. Delicious.

 

 

513 CORBIERES 1971 (France) .............. 1.99 22.00

Sturdy red wine of southern France which has been
awarded the V.D.Q.S. seal. A ‘best buy.’

622 CABERNET SAUVIGNON 1967 (Chile)... 1.99 22.00
It has been claimed that Chile pro-

duces the best non-European red =e
wine. In our opinion, this outstand- ‘Conch, Co’
ing example, made from the classic Ss! we

Cabernet Sauvignon grape of Bor-
deaux, is the best we have ever
experienced from this country. The
price bears little relation to its out-
standing excellence. Try it.

 

924 GAMZA RED (Bulgaria) ............-..-: 1.99 22.00
Bulgaria has always been a wine growing country. Its
Gamza is pleasant, fruity, with much bouquet—rather
like a Beaujolais. Interesting.

999 PINK CATAWBA (Hudson Valley) ....... 1.99 22.00

FUN-—NEW YORK STYLE! This wine is
grown along the shores of the Hudson,
just opposite Poughkeepsie. Suggest
you visit the vineyard and bring a ie
picnic lunch along. The Catawba grape, Y
indigenous to the east, was first grown HUD S@N
in the Carolinas and moved north- VALLEY
wards. Normally, ‘Catawba’ is white, aN

but by letting the red skin remain in TIN

the vat for several days, the result is a ow
beautiful pink wine. It is on the sweet s
side, and should be served ice cold.
