No
: Case
M-28 CHATEAU TALBOT (St. Julien) ................ 72.50
Big, full-bodied; eminently successful in 1970. A classic.
M-20A CHATEAU DUHART MILON ROTHSCHILD .... 75.50
Adjacent to Chateau Lafite, sharing the same proprietor,
Baron Elie de Rothschild. The Baron is sufficiently
proud of the wine which is produced at this 1855
classification vineyard to motivate him to add his
name to the label. Elegance and depth are beautifully
harmonized.
CHATEAU GRAND PUY LACOSTE (Pauillac) ... 82.50
‘Grand Cru.’ Puy means ‘high point.’ Full-bodied,
excellent.
CHATEAU RAUSAN SEGLA (Margaux) ........ 82.50
Thomas Jefferson once wrote, “Razan-Margau, this is
what I import for myself.” (Note the archaic 18th Cen-
tury spelling—nevertheless, Mr. Jefferson was referring
to this specific vineyard.)
CHATEAU MOUTON BARON PHILIPPE
(Pomiiac) = «5 35692) 6.400. soa 84.00
A ‘Grand Cru’ classified vineyard that shares the dis-
tinction of the First Growths, which command triple
the price. This vineyard is adjacent to Chateau Mouton
Rothschild, and shares the same proprietor, Baron
Philippe de Rothschild. Like Mouton Rothschild, there
is a high ratio of Cabernet Sauvignon, which gives the
wine its great depth, body and longevity. We do not
have too many cases, and respectfully suggest prompt
acquisition.
M-29A CHATEAU FIGEAC (St. Emilion) ............... 88.00
If you like Chateau Cheval Blanc, and are not prepared
to pay $270 the case, Chateau Figeac would be the ideal
alternative. Why? The vineyard is adjacent to Cheval
Blanc, produces a glorious wine and is similar in depth
and distinction. There are Bordeaux authorities who
claim it is Cheval Blanc’s equal. Extraordinary value in
truly great St. Emilion at relatively modest cost.
CHATEAU PICHON LALANDE (Pauillac) ....... 94.50
Distinguished for balance and depth of flavor. Similar
in characteristics to the Chateau Latour vineyard, which
it surrounds on three sides.
CHATEAU COS D’ESTOURNEL (St. Estephe) ... 94.50
Like the Chateau Lafon-Rochet that appears above, we
are dealing with a typical and great St. Estephe—ex-
hibiting much tannin, sturdiness, and with all of the
earmarks of great longevity.
CHATEAU LYNCH BAGES (Pauillac) ........... 94.50
Rich, full; almost achieves the weight of Mouton-
Rothschild—its neighbor.
CHATEAU MONTROSE (St. Estephe) .......... 99.50
Shares ‘Grand Crw’ classification in St. Estephe with
Calon Segur, Cos d’Estournel and Lafon-Rochet. Rich,
full, slow to mature, big—in the style of Chateau Latour.
CHATEAU BEYCHEVELLE (St. Emilion) ........ 108.00
Finesse is distinguishing characteristic of this noble
vineyard—graceful, elegant and always commands
among the highest prices in Bordeaux.
M-30A CHATEAU LA MISSION HAUT BRION ......... 160.00
Distinguishing characteristics are balance, finesse—the
superb flavor of Graves, and longevity. Classic.

The Giants of Bordeaux
1970

HERE ARE THE ‘NOBLEST VINEYARDS OF THEM ALL.’
Vineyards that set the standard—not only for the red wines of
Bordeaux, but for the red wines of the world. Here are clarets
endowed with such power, balance and longevity that they will
be alive and vibrant even two decades hence.

Just as an art collector attempts to buy Miro and Chagall shortly
after the painting is completed in the fond expectation that he
will not only enjoy its ownership, but relax in the certainty that
the price will surely go up later—so, the knowledgeable wine
collector acquires his ‘first growths’ shortly after a great vin-
tage, knowing that he will either enjoy drinking the wines, or
that they would cost considerably more had he chosen to ac-
quire them later. 1970 IN BORDEAUX IS SUCH A VINTAGE.

No. Case

M-75 CHATEAU AUSONE (St. Emilion) .............. 225.00
This vineyard, the former residence of the Latin poet,
Ausonius, shares with Cheval Blanc the honor of being
among the two best and greatest vineyards of St. Emil-
ion. The vineyard is small—and wines are hard to come
by—and we proudly offer some of their truly remarkable
1970. However, we urge early acquisition because the
supply is pitiably small.

CHATEAU MARGAUX (Margaux) ...........-. 240.00
Tasting from cask, it is displaying fine deep color, good
balance and rich bouquet.

CHATEAU LATOUOR Wautliac) « 2. cc. «ade 270.00
Our tasting notes read, “full-bodied—firm, exceptional
softness for Latour; will live for decades.” Some claim
Latour 1970 will be considered among the ‘immortals’
a decade hence.

CHATEAU HAUT BRION (Graves) ............. 270.00
Very big, full; power combined with elegance. Un-
doubtedly, the best Graves produced in 1970—in the
same exalted league as Lafite, Mouton and Latour. Now
is the time to acquire this great, great claret.
CHATEAU CHEVAL BLANC (St. Emilion) ...... 270.00
As in Petrus, the Merlot grape came through absolutely
‘perfect,’ providing one of the best Cheval Blancs of the
generation.

CHATEAU MOUTON ROTHSCHILD (Pauillac). .280.00
ASTONISHING! We have tasted from barrel at the Bor-
deaux vineyards for almost four decades. Rarely have
we experienced when tasting, the bigness, the power,
and the beautiful balance achieved by Baron Philippe
de Rothschild’s 1970 Mouton—certainly one of the great-
est examples ever produced at this noble vineyard.
CHATEAU PETRUS (Poueral «ee 295.00
Because of health of Merlot grapes, Chateau Petrus 1970
may well be the best Petrus produced in the last two
decades. Only 16 acres—hard to come by. Dramatic vel-
vetiness—a glory.

CHATEAU LAFITE-ROTHSCHILD (Pauillac) .. .335.00
We have watched the Lafite 1961 and 1959 climb to the
$750.00 per case mark and beyond. Given another dec-
ade, the same astronomic climb will surely happen to
Lafite 1970.
