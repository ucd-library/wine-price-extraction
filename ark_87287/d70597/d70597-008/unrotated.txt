Bordeaux.

Emilion vineyard.
CHATEAU DE SALES 6 ea a ee 3.99 43.10

CHATEAU FOURCAS-HOSTEIN ........ 4.29 46.35
Top flight Chateau-bottling from Medoc vineyard in the
commune of Listrac. Ranked by Time-Life Book ‘‘Wines
& Spirits” as one of the dozen Medoc vineyards worthy
of being included among the great 1855 classified.
CHATEAU LANGOA BARTON .......... 4.49 48.50
Extraordinarily good St. Julien. Classified ‘Grand Crw’ in

same league with the Leovilles, and similar in charac-
teristics.
CGHATEAU PRIEURE-LICHINE .......... 4.49 48.50
Alexis Lichine is particularly proud of what he bottled
at his beloved vineyard'in Margaux during the 1967 vin-
tage. Represents a beautiful harmony of flavor, fruit and
finesse. Will live long.

Classified ‘Grand Cru’ Graves. Owned by a group of
prominent Americans. Its 18th Century Chateau is con-
sidered one of the most beautiful examples of architec-

clientele to visit the Chateau when next in Bordeaux.
They promise a pleasant and instructive wine experience.

Outstanding St. Emilion of superb balance.
CHATEAU LAFON-ROCGHET ............ 4.79 51.75

St. Estephe at its best. Not as expensive as their more
world-famous neighbors but certainly their equal—based
on the tasting notes of our associate, Michael Aaron,
who has recently returned from the vineyard.
CHATEAU: LATOUR GARNET: 22.2: 4.89 52.80
Among the ’62 vineyards that were classified ‘Grand Cru
Medoc’ in 1855. A worthy price for a worthy vineyard.

‘Grand Crw’ of St. Julien that is ranked even above the
illustrious Beychevelle. The Beychevelle of this year
commands $75.50 in Bordeaux, thus making this an as-
tonishingly good value. Rarely have we run into more
finesse and elegance in the Medoc. Recommended
unreservedly.
