THE COUNTRY WINES OF FRANCE

 

Here are the local ‘vin du pays’ wines of France that bring so
much joy to tourists who explore the French countryside. Each
has its own personality, its own message, its own touch of
charm. They were not easy to come by since many of the
growers are not export-minded. Undoubtedly, you have heard
about some of them, have read of their virtues in literature—
and we happily bring them to you.

PINK COUNTRY WINES

(French Vin Rosé)

No. : Bottle Case

566 MINERVOIS ROSE 1970 (Gold Award)... 1.79 19.35
Each bottle proudly bears a seal announcing the fact that
this very wine won the Gold Award at the Macon Fair.
It is grown in the hilly country of the Languedoc, not
far from Provence. We quote the June issue of Vintage
Magazine, “This light, dry, crisp and well balanced
Minervois Rosé possesses a clean and refreshing pleas-
ant taste and after-taste which has won it a Medaille
d’Or de Macon. A perfect luncheon or dinner wine to
accompany hot or cold seafood, poultry and meat dishes
extremely well.” Strongly recommended to those who
want top flight Vin Rosé at sensationally low cost.

623 PROVENCE ROSE ........-.226sseeeeeees 1.99 21.50
A spritely pink grown near Mediterranean. Castel
Rubine.

643 LIRAC ROSE 1969 ........-.---seseeeeees 1.99 21.50

This estate-bottling by Domaine Closel recently won the
First Gold Award at the Paris Fair as the best within its
class. The vineyard is adjacent to Tavel, made of the
same Grenache grape, and is quite undistinguishable
from Tavel itself. This one is an absolute beauty.

Estate-bottled at the St. Cyr Cooperative—a Rosé made
of the superior Cabernet grape. A delight.

No ordinary Tavel this one, it is estate-bottled by Do-
maine Longval. It is of the current 1970 vintage, its youth
retaining its color, fruit and freshness. Because the soil
is arid and rocky, the yield per acre is small, resulting in
more flavor and bouquet than is usually associated with
a Rosé.

795 ROSE DE SANCERRE 1970 ...........--. 2.79 30.15
Amazing Rosé from town of Sancerre in Loire. Estate-
bottled, Cherrier.
