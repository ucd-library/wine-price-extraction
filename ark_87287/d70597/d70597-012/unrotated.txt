  

RED BURGUNDIES

Among recent vintages, ‘1970’ was the ‘star’ in Bordeaux; the
a ‘1969’ took the center of the stage in Burgundy. As in Bordeaux,
the world demand for the great vineyards of Burgundy are out-
stripping the limited capacity of the vignerons to produce.
The result has been that wine prices at the leading vineyards
have been spiraling upwards, complicated by a low harvest
yield in 1971, devaluation, and an eagerness on the part of the

Burgundians to achieve the high prices commanded by the
great vineyards of Bordeaux.

Below, we are dealing with great vintage years from top flight

- vineyards. The cellars of Burgundy are now denuded, but we

4 happily report that we have brought some of the gems to our
: friends in America. Choose among them.

ot 1969 VINTAGE

We know of no better way of testifying to the true excellence
of the 1969 red Burgundies than to simply quote Frank

Schoonmaker’s recently issued Vintage Report, ‘1969 is an
vA exceedingly great year in Burgundy, quite in the class with
Of B fabulous 1961 ...deep-colored, rich, everything that fine Bur-
ich gundies should be...a few conceivably even 20/20, which is

as high as I can go.” We know of no more persuasive statement

VOSNE ROMANEE, LA GRAND RUE ....16.50 178.20
We quote from Frank Schoonmaker’s Encyclopedia, ‘La
Grande Rue—its wine is altogether astonishing; produced

surpassed, perhaps even unequalled, by Romanée-Conti,
Richebourg and La Tache. It would be impossible to give
higher praise.” Estate-bottled, H. Lamarche.
