imposed by the technique of monochromy, thus carving, light blueis

carving and its intense, decorative values. (October 13, 1959)

INE ART we internalize emotionally; fine wine physically.
But the subtle threads that connect these two avenues of
life-enhancement are numerous enough to justify the blend-
ing in this catalogue of certain essences of graphic art with
certain essences of the vine. Back of both lies a magical
creative process, rooted in Nature, modulated by man. The
marriage of art and wine was joyfully celebrated in ancient
bacchanals—for is not the dance a kind of sculpture and
and that union has never been put

 

painting in free flow?
asunder.

By arrangement with the distinguished art-book pub-
lisher Harry N. Abrams, Sherry-Lehmann invites its clients

ing with clear, strongly incised lines accepting the narrow limits
h tone over black, brings to the fore Picasso’s love of expressive

to savor in these pages both the phenomenon named Piccaso
and the phenomenon named—WINE. On October 5 of this
year Pablo Picasso will be 91. We may apply to this out-
standing artist the words of Dr. Middleton in Meredith’s
The Egoist, when, referring to an ancient Hermitage, he
remarked: “(It) has the light of the antique; the merit that
it can grow to an extreme old age.” An initially great Bur-
gundy, Claret or Port, as it grows more venerable, enlarges
in excellence. I recently tasted an 1840 Port awesome in its
near-sequoian per-durability. In the same way this immortal
Iberian generates more and more new life out of the natural
world as his own career intensifies in energy as it unrolls
in time.
