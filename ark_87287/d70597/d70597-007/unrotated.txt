1969 REGIONALS

Don’t let the low prices at which we are offering these out-
standing regional Bordeaux wines dishearten you. They are not
run-of-the-mill—each of these wines traces its origin to a Spe
cific vineyard, placing them into a more thoroughbred class.
Ideally suited fo drinking day-in and day-out.

SANS-ANNEE

These two wines should not be overlooked. The ‘Simplet,’ is
beautifully balanced and a delight. The ‘Chateau Bahans Haut
Brion’ was grown and bottled at the famed Chateau Haut Brion
vineyard and is a blend of the 1964 and 1965 vintages. Extraor-
dinary opportunity for those who want truly outstanding wine
at relatively modest cost.

223 SIMPLET, Guy Schyler ...........------ 1.99 21.50
260 CHATEAU BAHANS HAUT BRION ...... 4.39 47.40

1969 CHATEAU BOTTLED

Because of half a normal production, the opening prices of the

1969 were record-breaking. The great ‘first growths’ will not

reach America until the end of 1972. In the interval, some ex-

ceptional examples have reached our shore. Here are some out-
standing values below $3.00 a bottle from excellent vineyards
of Bordeaux.

101 CHATEAU BELLEVUE ............-----:: 1.99 21.50
Our 1967 ran out quickly because everyone loved this
wine and came back for more. The excellent 1969 is now
arriving. Suggest ordering promptly because of excel-
lence, price and limited quantity.

314 CHATEAU GUIRAUD-CHEVAL .......... 2.19 23.65
Cote de Bourg sends us this delicious wine. Not chateau-
bottled, but excellent—outstanding value and good wine
at low cost.

248 CHATEAU COUTELIN .........-..----:: 2.49 26.90
St. Estephe. Excellent. Bottled by Eschenauer.
240 CHATEAU HANTEILLAN ..........----- 2.49 26.90

Excellent Medoc, recently bottled in Bordeau by
Eschenauer. This is the very wine that was chosen in a
blind competitive tasting by AIR FRANCE to serve on
their European flights.

168 CHATEAU CANON DE BREM .......... 2.49 26.90
A chateau-bottled discovery from Canon-Fronsac—vine-
yards overlook the Medoc from the opposite shore of the

Gironde.

380 CHATEAU LATOUR CARNET .......... 4.89 52.80
Classified ‘Grand Cru Medoc’ in 1855. Excellent.

164 CHATEAU LAFON-ROCHET ...........-- 4.99 53.90

One of the great ‘Grand Crus’ of St. Estephe. Long-lived,
superb, ideal for laying down.

1968 CHATEAU BOTTLED

Likely to be overlooked as a vintage, but certainly the ’68s are
much better than the ’63s and ’65s. The great vineyards listed
below, through selection and reduction of total quantity, have
been able to provide truly excellent wines and are ideally suited
for present drinking. Here are some giants of Bordeaux that
can be consumed now at a price much below the value of the
intrinsic excellence you will experience.
No. Bottle Case
498 CHATEAU VIELLE CHAP EMG. i. 6.3558) 2.99 32.30
Top flight St. Estephe vineyard—part of Chateau Lafon
Rochet. Beautifully balanced, rich in flavor; priced sen-
sationally low.
poe CHATEAU RIGEAG 9505. 3.39 36.95
‘Grand Cru’ St. Emilion. Situated adjacent to Cheval
Blanc, exhibiting the same round fullness and finesse.

259 CHATEAU LEOVILLE LASCASES ....... 3.79 40.95
St. Julien. One of the most sought-after of the Medocs.
178 CHATEAU CALON SEGUR .......-.---- 3.79 40.95

St. Estephe. Usually, this vineyard produces wines that
take a decade to mature. In a light year such as ’68 you
have a happy harmony. Ready now.

136. CHA TEAC LATOUR 2. 2) ess nes 7.99 86.30
A Pauillac giant. Latour often reaches great heights in
unfashionable years. ‘A best buy’ for those who want to
experience the elegance of Latour at a non-staggering
price.

15h CHATEAU PETRUS ...-- 8:6 eee ee 7.99 86.30
Chateau Petrus—the giant of Pomerol—is hard to come by
and usually commands over $20 the bottle. It was excel-
lent in 1968 and we have a few cases available at a live-
able cost.

THE 1968 CHATEAU SAMPLER—Two each of the six (6)

1968 clarets listed above (regularly $59.88)—only. . . $56.50

 

1967 CHATEAU BOTTLED

Exceptionally fine, soft, fruity, quicker to mature than 1966. It
took a while, but the current quotations in Bordeaux for '67
now approximate those that are being quoted for ‘66. If you
want superb claret for drinking during the next two or three
years, we suggest the '67 rather than the ’66s which are slower
to mature.

231 CHATEAU HANTEILLAN ...........---- 2.59 27.95
The wine of AIR FRANCE. Now has sufficient bottle age
to give softness. Bottled in Bordeaux by Eschenauer.

45. CUATEAU COUTERIN 2. io.) ee - <5 2.69 29.05

ing into its own—long life ahead.

A typically rich and full St. Emilion.
