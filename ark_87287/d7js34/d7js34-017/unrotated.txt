BEAUJOLAIS
TAMARTINN 2c. 1.59 17.15

Lamartine, the famed French poet, was born in Macon, not far
from where this wine was grown. Here is the proud product of
the Beaujolais Farmers Cooperative — every drop is from the
district and authentic. Price delightfully low, magnificent as a
summer wine. Half bottles at 94c each, 20.15 the case.

BEAUJOLAIS BLANG,
aia oo ek oe ea 1.65 17.95

The only white wine on this page. Beaujolais Blanc is similar in
nature and taste to Pouilly Fuissé. Here is a remarkable ex-
ample that is easily superior to most commercial Pouilly-Fuiss6é
on the market. Note the astonishingly low price. Half bottles at
97c each, case 20.95.

BEAUJOLAIS
VILLAGES, Talleyrand ...1.75 18.90

Beaujolais must come from one of the 35 recognized communes
of the district. Tastes even better when served slightly chilled.
Available in half bottles at 1.02, case 21.90. Also Magnums at
4.08 each, 21.90 case.

BEAUJOLAIS LUTECE ..1.89 20.40

Here is the very Beaujolais that was featured at André Surmain’s
Lutece Restaurant at his recent ‘Fortnight in Beaujolais’ Festival.
This event captured an enthusiastic response from the gourmets
of New York. Rich in fruit, a ‘gulping wine’ — the very kind of
Beaujolais that they are drinking so enthusiastically right at
this moment in Lyon and Paris. Sheer perfection as your summer
red wine. Available in half bottles at 1.09, case 23.40 — and in
dramatic magnums at 4.36 each, 23.40 case.

BROUILLY, Talleyrand ..1.89 20.40
One of the most sought-after of the Beaujolais. Delightful when
young; wonderful fruit, full body and flavor; remarkably agree-
able. Half bottles at 1.09, case 23.40.

BONBONNES .......... 3.99 21.95

( 6 Bonbonnes)

The thrifty, wine loving French buy in this large ‘‘Bonbonnes’’
size to get a family supply of good, everyday red wine. The
Bonbonnes holds 68 oz. (Only 4 oz. less than 3 full bottles of
wonderful, fruity, fresh Beaujolais.) We think you will agree
with Frank Schoonmaker that it is the wine discovery of the
year! Our last shipment was sold out in a week — we suggest
quick action here to avoid disappointment.

From the cellars of Moillard

Light, fresh, fruity, and generally not very expensive. Always
agreeable, delicate and fine. Very dependable and an outstand-
ing value.

CHASSAGNE

There are few better values in red Burgundy on the market
than the red wines from Chassagne Montrachet generally
more famed for its whites.

“EXCELLENT — THE BEST VINTAGE
S— FOR PRESENT DRINKING”

eived from Alexis Lichine, the author of ‘The Wines of France’: ‘‘in Beaujolais,
ll, due to excessive pre-harvest dryness. The reds are excellent... the fact
ess than in 1963 is being reflected in the prices. The good Cuvées have all been
better than the 1962s ... They are certainly the best Beaujolais available
u Beaujolais. Will not disappoint even the most critical.”

Due early August. Less fruity than other Beaujolais; matures
more slowly and resembles most closely the Burgundies of the
Cote d’Or. Excellent.

SUPERIEUR, J. Drouhin. .1.99 22.50

The 18th Century wine house of Joseph Drouhin only permits
the best examples of Beaujolais and Burgundy to carry its name.
The local Beaujolais farmers trust Drouhin and they have con-
sistently been giving him the best of their wine over the cen-
turies. This one is outstanding. Half bottles at 1.15, case 24.50.
Available first week of August.

25.80

Due to late bottling, will not be here until the latter part of
August. Somewhat lighter than Moulin-a-Vent, with quicker
maturation. Popular in Paris. Frank Schoonmaker discovered
this one for us.

FLEURIE GRAND COUR,
Se ee es 2.49 26.90

Will not arrive until August ist, but is worth waiting for. Con-
sidered the peer of the Moulin-a-Vent listed above, particularly
when estate-bottled by Maurice Crozet, the acknowledged
master of the Fleurie area. Remarkable fragrance and fruit. Half
bottles at 1.39, case 29.90.

Like the Moulin A Vent, the Fleurie is also available in the popu-
lar, delightful ‘‘Pot” bottle at 1.79 each, case 19.35. If you wish,
you can mix the case of Fleurie and Moulin A Vent in the Pots

for only 19.35.
MOULIN A VENT, Gaidon 2.49 26.90

Ranked as the finest single wine produced in Beaujolais, and
always the most expensive. It is the longest lived; in a great
year can be considered a great wine. Deep in color, firm, and
with much finesse. Half bottles at 1.39, case 29.90.

Also available in the beloved ‘Pot’ bottle with the familiar,
handsome Indian Club shape. When the half bottle is hardly
enough, and a full bottle too much, here is the perfect size.
(Holds 17 oz.) Available at 1.79 the Pot, 19.35 the case.

Hon. Ernest Marples ..... 2.49 30.15

Hon. Ernest Marples was Minister of Transport in the Conserva-
tive Government of Britain for over a decade. His avocations are
mountain climbing and growing the best wine of Beaujolais. As
testimony of this, we happily report that his 1964 Fleurie won
the Golden Award at the recent Paris wine exposition. No better
Beaujolais is made. His wine is rationed both in England and
America. Will arrive during late August.

CHRISTENED THE

1959 RED BURGUNDY —«vintace oF THE CENTURY”

Let us forget about the lesser wines of ’59 because their fruit and charm, delightful at the beginning, have
now expended themselves. The very best of the 1959s are still slowly improving — are showing their superb
qualities; should be consumed, except for a few of the giants, during the next five years.

as high as Chambertin itself. Superb.

Alexis Lichine only owns 2 acres of Bonnes Mares, but the
wine he produces here deserves the description ‘superlative.’
Here is a great 1959 and fabulous for present drinking.
