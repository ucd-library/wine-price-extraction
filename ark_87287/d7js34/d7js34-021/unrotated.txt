Of the °62, °61 and °58 vintages... all available for immediate delivery.

Perhaps the rarest and most sought after red wine of the world are those produced by the DOMAINE DE LOM See
CONTI. The production is small, and each of these four vineyards are rationed among the discriminating wine drinkers
of Paris, London and New York. Experts concede they are expensive, but worth the price. The best values here, dollar
for dollar, are certainly the remarkable’58s which have now acquired enough bottle-age to give you the perfect finish that
only maturation can impart. Romanee Conti’s neighbors did not produce a great wine in 1958 because they picked too
early. However, Comte de Villaine, the proprietor, had the courage to ‘risk all’ by waiting three weeks longer before
harvesting. His gamble succeeded — one of the best of the Domaine’s wines produced since the war, despite that it is an
unfashionable vintage, is certainly their 1958s.

A word about the Domaine’s 62’s — two months of perfect weather, lasting through the vintage, produced one of the best
vintages in a decade and deserves the appellation “great.” In the league with the classic ’61s; will mature more quickly;
and thus can be enjoyed sooner. As for the ’61s, these are the kind of wines that should be laid down now and not

touched for at least another five years.

CONDRIEU

VEER 5 ALMOST ALL CONSUMED LOCALLY AT THE PYRAMIDE AT
USS at VIENNE — NOW IN AMERICA FOR THE FIRST TIME...

: Since 1935, our gastronomic clients who have eaten at Point’s Pyramide at Vienne
Ch ATEAVobv ROZ AY or the restaurants of Lyon have asked us for Condrieu. We must admit that for three
decades, no matter how hard we pressured importers, we have never been able to
"CONDRIEV'APPELLATIONCONTROLEE °DPtain any. But we were persistent — and now, in the summer of 1965 — we are the
proud recipients of the first shipment of this most sought-after, unusual dry white

MVLTIER PROPRIETAIRE wine of the Rhone Valley, produced 30 miles south of Lyon.

The total production rarely exceeds 600 cases a year and most of it goes to the
Pyramide Restaurant. It is made of the rare Viognier grape, golden in color, fruity, and possessed of a remarkable and
distinctive bouquet. The terraced vineyards are the steepest of France and so appear to be the prices demanded by the
vigneron. Quantity limited. Order early if you want to be assured of at least tasting Condrieu.
