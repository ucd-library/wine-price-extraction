Dear Messrs. Aarons

We are proud to inform you that Barrel No. 9204 of our 1959 "Kaseler
Hitzlay-Herrenberg Beerenauslese" recently won the highest wine award of
Germany, before a group of connoisseurs, including the Minister of
Interior, Steubinger. Bestowed on it was the fabulous "Weinpreis" as the best
single wine produced in Germany during the great 1959 vintage in competition
with the best of the Rheingau, Pfalz, Moselle, Saar and Ruwer.

TREASURED BOTTLES FROM REICHSGRAF VON KESSELSTATT
Collectors’ Item of the Great 1959 Vintage

No. Bottle wee
R1 KASELER HITZLAY-HERRENBERG BEEREN AUSLESE ....... 29.50 Fee

The balance, fruit, distinction has hit a new high mark in our white wine tasting experience. It is the kind of
wine that one does not serve with food, but by itself, reverently, and to quote our Germany wine friends,
‘on bended knee.’ Upon opening, the bouquet fills the air like a flower garden; it should be lingered over
to capture the maximum bouquet. It is a true ‘conversation piece’ and glory. To offer its delight to a maximum
number of wine lovers, we must limit the sale to bottles, rather than cases. We suggest early acquisition,
because surely all of these will be spoken for quickly. Available for delivery in July. Fuder 9204

R2  JOSEPHSHOEFER FEINE AUSLESE, Fuder 9037 ...........-. 9.95 110.00

Proud recipient of the Golden Kammerpreismunze. A powerful, dramatic wine that nevertheless retains
softness. The best barrel of the famed Josephshof vineyard, owned for over a century by the Kesselstatt
family. Although in the township of Graach, the Josephshof is directly adjacent to Wehlen and is the equal
of the greatest Wehlener — rich, full-bodied, big and fine. Available in July.

R4 PIESPORTER GOLDTROEPFCHEN FEINSTE SPAET-AUSLESE 12.50 142.00

Received the coveted Gold Award of Kammerpreismunze. This wine has a wonderful uncloying sweetness;
soft, dramatic bouquet, and pleasant balance. It is this very wine that was chosen to be served at the banquet
at Bonn, in honor of the visit of our late President, John F. Kennedy, to Germany. Quantity limited.
Available in July. Fuder 9152

R5 JOSEPHSHOEFER TROCKENBEERENAUSLESE ...........+. 29.50 345.00
Not only received the Golden Kammerpreismunze, but the Honor Prize of the State. The sweetest, richest,
most dramatic and most expensive of the German wines. Each individual grape, not the cluster, is left on the
vine until it is so ripe that it is practically as bone dry as a raisin (Trocken). This can only happen in a
very great year and the yield is infinitesimal. Generally, the cost in labor and in acreage overhead is higher
to the grower than even the fantastic price he must get for the wine. However, this is done more as a
labor of prestige and love rather than of profit. A breathtaking wine. Available in July.

R6 PIESPORTER GOLDTROEPFCHEN
TROCKENBEERENAUSLESE ............ ie aan 29.50 345.00

This noble wine shares the Gold Prize and the Honor Prize with the Josephshoefer. There are less than 10
cases in existence. A bit richer and sweeter than the Beerenauslese that the Reichsgraf von Kesselstatt refers
to in the letter above. Available in July.
