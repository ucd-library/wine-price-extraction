that can truly be called great.” Quick to mature, of perfect balance, rich in fruit and charm — there are
almost no failures among the 1962 reds. Though not quite as long-lived as the 1961s, a veritable Fort Knox in

terms of longevity, they will prove delightful now as well as five years hence. Don’t ignore 1962 — a very
very excellent year.
