superiority because of the superior qualities of the vintage year

CHATEAUNEUF DU
Pave we... 3.79 40.95

Frank Schoonmaker found this remarkable Rhone wine for us
and we quote the 1952 evaluation from his Encyclopedia, ‘‘If
genuine, exceedingly great. Ripe and splendid today, but show-
ing no trace of old age. 19/20". From the remarkable Clos de
Felibres vineyard — worth double this price if intrinsic merit
were the only criterion.

From a single, steep, spectacular terraced hillside some 50 miles
south of Lyon. George Saintsbury describes this as ‘‘the man-
