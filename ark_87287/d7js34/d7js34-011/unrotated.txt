No Regularly Bottle Case

442 MUSCADET 1962, Estate Bottled, Barre Freres 1.69 1.29 13.95
The delicate dry white wines of the Loire Valley are becoming popular throughout the world. One of the most
delightful is “Muscadet” which is produced not far from the town of Nantes. Here it is in all its fresh dry delicacy
— sheer perfection for summer drinking — at the unbelievably low price of only $1.29 the bottle. Certainly one of
the most popular white wines we have ever offered.

599 GROS-PLANT 1964, Estate Bottled, Sautejeau 1.69 1.49 16.10
The fresh, light, tart white wine made from the Folle Blanche grape around Nantes, near the mouth of the Loire. It
is the wine that the natives drink most copiously with the oysters gathered from the nearby sea. This marks the
frst time that this wine — so perfect with seafood — has been imported into the United States. Its thirst-quenching
qualities are sheer perfection with delicate summer menus.

689 POUILLY-SUR-LOIRE 1964, Gaudry 1.85 1.59 17.15
Around the town of Pouilly, not far from Nevers, on the Loire, there are about 1,000 acres of vineyard. One-third
grows the admirable Sauvignon Blanc grape which gives us the noble Pouilly-Blanc-Fume below. The remainder
is cultivated with the Chasselas grape, not quite as distinguished but providing a fresh, short-lived, agreeable kind
of carafe wine. Available in half bottles at 94¢ each, $20.15 the case.

592 CHENIN BLANC 1964, Talleyrand 1.99 1.69 18.25
The famed white wine grape of Saumur. Fresh, very light in color, quick maturing, dry, good breed. A favorite of
the knowledgable of Tours, Blois and Angers. Available in half bottles at 99¢ each, $21.25 the case.

430 MUSCADET 1964, Estate Bottled, Barre Freres 1.99 1.79 19.35
Full of fruit and freshness; 1964 was a glory in the Loire; at peak for drinking now.

543 CABERNET SAUMUR 1964 (RED), Champigny 1.79 19.35
A delightful red wine made of the Cabernet Franc grape—respected in France as the best red wine of the Anjou
area. Grown not far from the famed Cavalry School in Saumur. Available in half bottles at $1.04 each, $22.35
the case.

Unique

691 POUILLY BLANC FUME 1964, Gaudry Bargain 4.99 21.50
Everyone asks us how it is possible to sell an authentic Pouilly Blanc Fume, the most distinguished white wine
of the Loire, at a price as low as this. Here is the answer — the wine was bought in large quantities, shipped by
barrel to Bordeaux, and bottled there. The savings to the French wine merchant were enormous. His price was
lowered and all of the economic advantages are being passed on to you. Try it — you will find it excellent. Avail-
able in half bottles at $1.64 each, $24.50 the case.

413 MUSCADET, CLOS ORFEUILLES, 1964 2.29 1.99 21.50
Michel Dreyfus is able to extract the treasures of the Loire, for he is the one who imports the Pouilly-Blance Fume
from Chateau Nozet. He has discovered another treasure in the same countryside here with this truly remarkable
Muscadet. Available in half bottles at $1.14 each, $24.50 the case.

455 VOUVRAY RESERVE 1962, Monmousseau 2.45 1.99 21.50
At this time of year in Tours, not far from where the wine is grown, the most popular cry is “Ouvrez le Vouvray!”
They ask that it be young, dry, and from Monmousseau because he is the most famed Vouvray grower of them all.

431 MUSCADET-SUR-LIE 1964, Barre 2.75 2.49 26.90
The lees is the heavy sediment which young wines throw in barrel. These are left behind when the wine is
“racked” or transferred from one barrel to another. This Muscadet was slowly and carefully taken from the barrel
by hand, not to disturb the sediment at the bottom. It is a costly process, and is wasteful of wine. However, the
reward is a rich, intense, and exceedingly flavorsome Muscadet that will prove astonishingly good to many of
you. Less than 100 cases were produced in this fashion.

538 POUILLY-BLANC-FUME 1962, Estate Bottled, Lebrun 2.79 2.49 26.90
Excellent white wine, quite dry. Made entirely from the superior Sauvignon Blanc grape. The rage of Paris and
now of sophisticated New Yorkers. Available in half bottles at $1.39 each, $29.90 the case.

470 SANCERRE 1962, Estate Bottled, Cherrier 270 2.49 26.90
Like its just-across-the-river neighbor, Pouilly Fume, Sancerre produces a dry white wine of captivating delicacy.
Made of the same noble grape. Available in half bottles at $1.39 each, $29.90 the case.

399 SPARKLING VOUVRAY 1962, Monmousseau 4.99 4.59 49.55

A distinguished rival to Champagne —the basic difference being that Vouvray, with equal effervescence and
character, is much more fruity and considerably less dry.
