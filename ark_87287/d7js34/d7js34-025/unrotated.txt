We know of no French Champagne that can match this one in low cost, combined with balance, dryness and excel-

lence in bouquet and flavor.

36 MARCEL PERE ET FILS BRUT 1959 4.99 4.59 50.25

An astonishing Champagne opportunity. Made of selected grapes gathered during the great 1959 harvest. The wine

case of 24 — and Magnums at $9.59 each; $52.25 the case.

155 AYALA GOLD LABEL BRUT 1959 5.49 4.99 56.50

We have just returned from Europe and we saw this winelisted everywhere we went in Paris and London. Although
it is highly respected in Europe, it is not that well-known here. This makes it possible for you to drink truly fine
Champagne at this astonishingly low cost. Half bottles also available at $2.79 each; $60.00 the case.

Gilbert Lejeune has spent the last two years transforming the LEDOYEN, located on the
Champs Elysees into the most beautiful and luxurious restaurant of all Paris. A native of
Champagne, Mr. Lejeune takes his wine seriously. He has chosen what he considers the
best of Champagne to bear the name of this gastronomic shrine. Enjoy it at the LEDOYEN
when you are in Paris — order it from Sherry’s when you are back home.

31 LOUIS ROEDERER COUR ROYALE BRUT 7.95 6.98 75.50

Here is one of the best non-vintage Champagnes we have ever tasted. It is a remarkable blend of the light and ele-
gant 1960’s, combined with the wonderful, fruity Cuvee of the 1959. Though there is no vintage date on the label, here
is a wine that will rival and equal even the better of the vintage Champagnes. Specially priced at $6.98. Also avail-
able in half bottles at $3.75 each, and in Splits at $1.97.

54 BOLLINGER BRUT 1955 ea 10.00 108.00

An extraordinary wine! For the past year, our most discriminating Champagne customers have been requesting the
remarkable 1955 vintage of Bollinger, one of the greatest Champagnes produced during this generation. We happily
report that Madame Bollinger has made a few cases available to us — the last of her reserve. It is not on sale but
represents a sufficiently unique value in truly great Champagne to be included.

LR1 Your choice of LOUIS ROEDERER ’42, ’43,’47,o0r’45 = 12.25 9.95 —

We tasted these remarkable old Champagnes in the cellars of Roederer and the Managing Director said, “They
are so beautiful because we have stored them under perfect conditions. We do not export them because all we own
is only a small reserve.” However, our associate, Sam Aaron, was sufficiently persuasive to induce Roederer to send
a token shipment which only recently arrived in perfect state, so that their delight can be shared on this side of
the Atlantic.

SS1 SEBASTIANI BRUT (California) 3.99 3.59 38.75

The great grape of the French Champagne district is Pinot Chardonnay. The Sebastianis use primarily the same
grape and have created an excellent dry, well-balanced Champagne that proudly bears the family name. Here is
the very wine which won Gold Medals at Pomona in 1958 and 1960 and recently a Silver Medal in 1964. Also
available in half-bottles at $1.99 each, $42.95 case of 24.

SPARKLING WINE FROM THE FRENCH ALPS...
81 BOYER BRUT 1961 (Haut-Savoie) 3.99 3.49 39.75

The Parisians have discovered the crisp, dry, refreshing Champagne-like Sparkling Wine produced in a colorful,
French mountain town in the Alps, not far from the French border. They know it is naturally fermented in the
bottle; they also know that this is the best Sparkling Wine produced in France, outside the Champagne District
itself; and they also know that it represents the best value in the land. A wise choice for summer lawn parties,
receptions, boat launchings, and weekend gifts.
