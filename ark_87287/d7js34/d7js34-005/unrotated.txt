WISHOM’S FINO. PALMA .. .. 6. c ere ee ee ein tme es es
A magnificent example of bone dry, pale, straw colored Sherry. This classic ‘Fino Palma’ has helped Wisdom &
Warter achieve its great international reputation, now over a century old. An ideal aperitif when served slightly

chilled.
WISDOM’S ROYAL BROWNOLOROSO ........-.--- +--+ 55: 2.19 1.79 19.95

There are few wines produced in the world that quite achieve the rich, deep flavor, or dark color depth of a fine
Brown Sherry. Here is a typical, fully aged example.

WISDOM’S AMONTILLADO FINO .......---- 2+ +e eee reece 2.49 1.99 22.65

As this name implies, a good Amontillado belongs to the Fino family, but they acquire certain different character-
istics as they mature; the color becomes more amber-like. As in the Finos, they are very dry, more nutty in flavor

and develop greater body.
eee GLEN CREAM... 0.4, 2.99 2.49 27.95

Generally speaking, a top-flight Cream Sherry such as this is the oldest and most luxurious of the wines found in
the Bodegas of Jerez. Usually, a fine Cream Sherry of a reputable firm commands $5.00 or more the bottle. It is no
ordinary event to obtain this medium dry, dramatically rich, wine for only $2.49. We urge that you try it.

WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE’S BONE DRY FINO .............-. 2.99 2.49 27.95

Here is a Fino that will compete with the classic, best selling, pale bone dry Finos that are the rage of Madrid. It
proudly bears the name of the Bard who was fond of his bit of ‘Sherris-Sack’ on occasion. Worth over $3.50 the

bottle.
WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE’S DRY OLOROSO ............... 3.29 2.69 30.50

The word ‘dry’ appears on the label. However, this is only relatively true. It does not possess the excessive rich
sweetness of most Olorosos because it does have a dry finish.

BRIGGS 1915 AMONTILLADO SOLERA ............-.-.---- 4.99 3.49 39.75

A perfect expression of the Amontillado type Sherry. Dry, yet with sufficient body to give it depth of flavor. Cask
laid down in 1915 and periodically refreshed with younger, aged wines.

BRIGGS 1914 CREAM SOLERA ............ cece ee eee cece 5.99 4.99 58.50
Amazing value! — particularly when you consider the fact that Cream Sherries that lack this age and distinction
command a high price than this in the open market. Quantity limited. Cask laid down in 1914 and periodically
refreshed with younger, aged wines. Consistent with the Spanish Solera system of aging sherries.

BOTTLE AGED (June 1950) AMONTILLADO OF JOHN HARVEY 8.95 6.95 79.50
A rare sherry that surpasses in character any other Amontillado that we have ever imported. John Harvey’s of
London selected one of their best casks of Amontillado and bottled it in June 1950. This sherry, as in the aging of
vintage ports, then acquired further character, dryness and development in the bottle from 1950 to date. Quantity
limited.

GRAHAM’S WESTMINSTER TAWNY ...............------ 2.99 1.99 22.65

No ports are more respected in the social clubs of London than those that bear the name of ‘Graham.’ Graham’s
have long been famous for the remarkable quality of their vintage ports and they bestow the same kind of loving
care on the barrel ports, such as this excellent Tawny.

DA SILVA’S PORT OF THE 1908 VINTAGE ................ 9.00 8.25 94.50

1908 is a vintage year that the discriminating octogenarian speaks of reverently. It was remarkable fortune for us,
and for our clients, to have been able to persuade the fine old Portuguese firm of Da Silva to part with several
cases. A unique tasting experience is in store for those who acquire this thoroughbred.

THE SERCIAL MADEIRA OF BLANDY ..................... 2.79 2.49 27.95

The ‘Sercial’ is the excellent white grape that produces the best dry wine on the island of Madeira. It is generally
conceded that the best firm of Funchal is that of Blandy’s, similar to a Fino Sherry, but with its own individual
bouquet and character. Serve chilled.

WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE’S MALMSEY ..................5. 2.99 2.49 27.95

According to Shakespeare, the Duke of Clarence was drowned in a butt of Malmsey. We are not suggesting that
you buy a whole butt to rid this planet of your mortal enemies. However, we do think a discreet acquisition of
a single bottle will introduce you to the very rich, sweet deep golden Malmsey wine which is comparable to a
Cream Sherry. It goes well, according to our grandfathers, with terrapin, shad and bisquits.

BLANDY’S 1885 MALMSEY VINTAGE MADEIRA ........... 13.75 12.50 139.00

Every drop is of the 1885 vintage and is so testified to in hand-signature on each label by Mr. Horace Zino, a direc-
oe ee firm of Blandy’s. It was acquired from the private reserve of Arthur Barros, a prominent collector of
ne Madeira.
