straw-colored, very light and fresh.
None better in Italy. On sale at

1.69, case 18.25.

MEMO ON N.Y.
STATE SALES TAX

We consider it our responsibility
to keep our clients informed not
only about wines and spirits, but
on any economic matters that may
influence their cost.

As we go to press, our alert
accounting firm informs us that
beginning August 1st Sherry’s will
be responsible to New York State
(no longer the city) for the collec-
tion of the State sales tax.

They advise us that the tax will be:
a) A minimum of 2%, regardless
of location within N.Y. state. b) An
added tax that will vary from ‘zero’
to 3%, dependent on the com-
munity in which the purchaser re-
sides.

In other words, the sales tax will
vary from a minimum of 2% to a
maximum of 5%, varying with each
community. We can only accept
the lower prevailing tax rate pro-
vided the order reaches us NO
LATER THAN SATURDAY, JULY
31st!

BOMBAY is a city in India with a population of
4504,294: BOMBAY was a jewel in the crown of
Queen Victoria — and the heat-relieving drink of

this bustling city was, and is, English Gin.

BOMBAY is also the name of one of the proudest
and finest Gins produced in London, produced from
a unique recipe that pre-dates Queen Victoria. It is
the Gin that has captured the imagination of many
parts of the globe, particularly the United States.
It is the kind of Gin, bottled at a pleasant 86 proof
that is designed to add its touch of good cheer to

your summer drinking and entertaining.

Your dry martini will develop a unique flavor; mix
it with Rose’s Lime Juice, and a twist of freshly cut
lime and enjoy a Bombay Gimlet; with a / of a
fresh lime, and tonic water, you have a most refresh-
ing ‘Gin & Tonic’; with freshly-squeezed lemon, lots
of ice, and soda, you can have a remarkable ‘Tom

Collins’.

And during these balmy, Bombay-like summer
days, we can think of no pleasanter warm weather
activity than gently lolling in a hammock, with a
‘Bombay Drink’ in your hands, toasting the mem-
ory of Queen Victoria and the British Empire over

which she reigned.
