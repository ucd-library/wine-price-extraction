A WINE DISCOVERY

From Northern California, two interesting wines have just
reached us one a red; ST. MICHEL MOUNTAIN ROUGE
the other a dry white; ST. MICHEL MOUNTAIN BLANC. Each
of these makes no more claim to greatness than the cheerful
little ‘vins du pays’ of France. Like them, they are fresh, clean,
satisfying wines such as may be found in many a French
country inn, usually without label or date but nevertheless
good.

Don't let the low price dissuade you from trying them — we
think you will find them entirely delightful. And if it’s small
bottles that you prefer, we have them at 49c each — $11.50
the case of 24 halves.

The wines of the region of Jerez de la Frontera, Spain (which the English,
centuries ago, changed to “Sherry”) are made from blends of many wenes ae
in a delimited region. They are aged by traditional methods in large ee
above the ground (“bodegas”) and are carefully fortified with the best Spanish

brandy.

Those listed below represent the best selections from the leading shippers and
constitute perhaps, the most complete list to be found in New York today
