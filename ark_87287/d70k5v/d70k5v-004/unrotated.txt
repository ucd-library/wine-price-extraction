BLENDED WHISKIES

Here are the most popular of American whiskies. Year in and year out, they
continue as favorites. All are skillful blends of aged pure whiskies with pure
erain neutral spirits, which have no effect on the flavor other than to soften
and attenuate it.

These whiskies, particularly in the lower price brackets, will be sharply affected
by any ban on distillation.

Scotch whiskies start the New Year courageously with the announce-
ment of a price reduction. The average Scotch will probably cost
you .30 the bottle less. Part of this reduction reflects a tariff de
crease, the remainder a decrease in trade profit. Glad tidings indeed
for those fond of this world-famous spirit.
