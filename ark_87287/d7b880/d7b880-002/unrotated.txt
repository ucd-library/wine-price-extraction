highest natural sugar content since 1961. The wines
of 1975 are rich, full, complex, and deeply tannic,
the best of the classified growths will reward the
patience of any claret lover who holds them for
five to ten years, And in the lower price range,
even the unassuming Bordeaux Superieurs and Medocs
deserve the adjective "outstanding".
