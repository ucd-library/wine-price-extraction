The Most Remarkable
Eaux-de-Vie,

Cognacs of France
from

the cellars of

JEAN DANFLOU

When in Paris, art lovers are advised to go to the Louvre—and brandy lovers to JEAN
DANFLOU on Rue Thabor. We heeded this sage advice, and found the most remarkable
treasure trove of Eaux-de-Vie, Armagnacs and Cognacs we have ever tasted. There are

few Parisian gourmets who have not frequented the famed— and glorious—brandy
boutique’ of Jean Danflou. 2
We happily report that the best of his treasury has only recently arrived— Kena
Eachisa winnerwithinitsclass. Butsince these rarities have been shipped in

such small quantities, we urge you to purchase your favorites early. F
You will be proud to serve these magnificent examples of the

best France has to offer, which also make ideal gifts for those

who appreciate the extraordinary.

The Finest Whiskey Ever
to Come Out of Scotland!

Founded in 1749, Justerini & Brooks has for centuries been considered a shrine
by those seeking the most magnificent whiskies of Scotland. Now, for the first
time in many years, Justerini & Brooks present their 20 Years Old Malt Scotch
Whisky, which they believe may be the finest and noblest whisky ever to come
out of Scotland. An extraordinary drinking experience, once restricted to the
great landowners of Scotland and England, now reaches us in America.

Most Scotches are a blend of malt whisky and grain whisky. It is the malt whisky,

however, that provides the true taste, flavor, complexity, and bouquet. Maltis the

foundation of the blend—the ‘classic feature’ of the best Scotch whisky.

Justerini & Brooks 20 Years Old contains, as the decanter label proudly pro-

claims, malt whiskies only.

Malt whiskies improve year by year during their maturing life in cask, while grain

whiskies do not improve much beyond about 5 years. Justerini & Brooks believe

that the individual malt whiskies contained in this product are at their peak at 20

years. We—and all true devotees of Scotch whisky—agree.

The decanter that contains this superb whisky must be

mentioned. It is made of heavy, heavy glass, adorned with E —
=

beautiful glass stopper. The austerely handsome design
reflects the character of 18th century Scotland.

From the
Glenlivet
District
comes the
MOST
REMARKABLE

SCOTCH
