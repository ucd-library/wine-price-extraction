21-6’ The ‘superp
CHERRY MARNIER
comes in its rich velour-
covered bottle; one of
the best cherry liqueurs
of Europe.

 
 
 
 
 

 
 
  

“21-D” BEEFEATER GIN has become the
vogue of America with the prospect of
selling one million cases in the reasonbly
near future. Excellent for gift-giving.

  
   
 

 

“21-C” An “entente cordiale”
for this post-war period can
hardly be found in interna-
tional relations. But it can be
found in the field of liqueurs —
the happy alliance of ‘Bene-
dictine & Brandy” — better
known as B & B.

   
 

  
  

“21-F” The search for light-
ness continues. Here is NOIL-
LY PRAT, France’s most famed
dry vermouth. It will not cast a
shadow in the martini-glass,
nor be any darker than the ice-
cubes in your vermouth-on-

the-rocks. (29.05 case) 2.69
