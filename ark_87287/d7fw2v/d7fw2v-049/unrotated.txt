“96-A” This rather quaint 19th Century
approach to a spirit is not without his-
tory. It is not distilled in England but
in France; it is not 86 proof but a manly
96 proof; it would be appreciated in
Martinis by members of both sexes.

‘26-C” OLD GRAND-DAD has

Bonded Bourbon in America since
the 19th Century. Lends itself per-
fectly to gift giving to any of your
friends who are Bourbon lovers.
