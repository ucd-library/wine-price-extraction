What we have sent you is all that we make.

You see our Blanc de Blancs is a very special Champagne.
It is made only from the white Pinot Chardonnay
grape which grows on only one hillside in all of France.

And if in some years the grapes are not good enough,
we do not make the champagne at all.

That is why there will be no 1963 and no 1965
Blanc de Blancs to carry the Ruinart name.

We take pride in our name. We are a family business,
the oldest champagne firm in France. My great- great-
great-great-great-great-great-great-great uncle (on my mother’s side),
Nicholas Ruinart, founded our firm in 1729.

From the very beginning, we prospered. We began to serve
kings, queens, barons, czars, dukes, earls and the common man.
Years ago, we had
standing orders from
people like Napoleon,
Talleyrand, the
Empress Marie-Louise
and Charles X. And
not long ago, we had the
honor of delivering a
bottle of our champagne
to your President,
Andrew Jackson.

And now you have
it all. 1300 cases of
Dom Ruinart Blanc de
Blancs Champagne,
1959. The best
champagne we make,
made in a great
vintage year.

We are only sorry
we could not send
vou more.

A reasonable amount of
Dom Ruinart is reaching us
but we suspect that it will
be depleted well before
Christmas day. We
therefore respectfully
suggest that if you wish to
send this unique and
remarkable Champagne
that you anticipate your
holiday needs and order

immediately. SHERRY- LEHMAN N ; INC.
