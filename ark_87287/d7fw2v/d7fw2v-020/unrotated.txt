“19-A” If one were seeking
the best white wine of the
Loire, he would find it here
at Chateau Nozet. Their
POUILLY FUME 1964 is fabu-
lous. (37.70 case) 3.49

“19-C” Our good
friend, Richard
Blum, president
of the company
which imports
PETER DAW-
SON reports an
extraordinary in-
crease in the
sale of this
whisky during
the last two
years. He _attri-
butes it to the
quality of the
whisky, careful
blending and
well-balanced
lightness.

,19-D™ TEACHERS
HIGHLAND CREAM, is
not a favorite at Oxford
simply because of the
educational implications
of its name. Rather, it’s
because its flavor is un-
mistakable, distinctively
Scottish, and excellent
even by the haughty
standards of a Don.

 

“19-B” HENNESSY V.S.O.P. has an av-
erage age of about 20 years and is a

Grande Fine Champagne Cognac. Prob-
ably the best of the V.S.O.P.s.

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 

“49-E” BALLANTINE 21 YEAR Scotch is
shipped to the U.S. in very small quan-
tities. Some connoisseurs claim it is the
best whisky extant, regardless of price.
In any event, ideally suited for gift giving.
