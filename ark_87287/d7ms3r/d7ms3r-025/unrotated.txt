ADVANCE SALE OFFERING
OF 1970 RHINES & MOSELLES

EVERYONE IS TALKING about 1970 on the Rhine and Moselle.
We have gone to great effort to see that the ’70s would be shipped
express, so they would be here in time to add their freshness, fruit,
and good cheer to your summer pleasures.

All of the 1970’s shown below will reach our cellars the first few
days of July and you can count on delivery before July 10th, whether
it be your apartment in the city, or your summer vacation address.

The growers along the Rhine and Moselle rivers are rightfully happy
with their 1970 crop. It is true that they did not produce too many
peak wines in the exalted ‘Auslese’ and ‘Beerenauslese’ class—
however. this was more than compensated for by a bounteous crop
of truly superb, typical and well-balanced regionals and the less
complex estate-bottlings. After all, it is these less costly and less
sweet German wines that have proven most popular in America.

All of these represent regional wines at their best and come from an
impeccable source, HANS KENDERMANN. Mr. Kendermann is
recognized in Germany as an outstanding authority, never compro-
mising with quality. All of these wines are O'N SALE this summer.
Our advice is simple—if you are interested in acquiring authentic
and excellent Rhines and Moselles at low sale price to fortify your
summer menus, NOW IS THE TIME to acquire them.
