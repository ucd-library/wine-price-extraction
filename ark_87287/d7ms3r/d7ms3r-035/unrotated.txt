Hotel De La Poste, Beaune

 

Marc Chevillot, Proprietor

Those who follow the wine trail
consider a pilgrimage to Bur-
gundy not completed unless they
relax and dine at the historic
Hotel de la Poste that overlooks
the city square and the 15th Cen-
tury Hospice de Beaune. It is at
this ancient, historic inn that the vignerons of the Cote d’Or
gather to discuss wine, vintages and yield. For decades the
gracious host was Chevillot Pere—now it is the handsome, vital
and knowledgeable Mare Chevillot, the son—a man who enjoys
a high reputation for dedication and devotion to food and wine.

The listings shown below are the same wines that are now being
served at this gastronomic oasis—all were personally selected at
the vineyard by Mare Chevillot. Some of you may have tasted
these wines at Hotel de la Poste during a Burgundy sojourn—you
may have tried to bring them back home with you—but the cost
of the air freight proved to be discouraging. Now,’ we happily
report you can acquire them quite easily—right here in New
York, and at enticing prices. They are all here to add their delight
to your summer repasts.

and Avignon.

Marc Chevillot sells more of this excellent ‘Villages’ than any
other red wine on his list.

of Beaune.

241 MOULINGA-VENE 1970. 3.49 37.70
Astonishing! ‘Moulin-a-Vent,’ the best vineyard of Beaujolais,
can compete with the average good red Burgundy.

283 GEVREY-CHAMBERTIN 1966 .................. 5.39 58.20
Mare Chevillot passes this famed wine commune in his car

The most prized wine village of all Burgundy. Superb.

WHITE WINES

‘Aligote’ is the second best white wine grape of Burgundy. It is
not too well known in America, but is drunk copiously along
the Cote d’Or. Young, fresh, dry—ideal for Summer drinking.

363 POUIELY-FUISSE 1969: 2. 369 39.85
Chevillot drives south to get this popular dry white Burgundy.
An outstanding example.

371 WEIS AU CE TOGO ooo ee ee te 3.69 39.85
Only ten minute’s drive away from the inn—we can presume
that such friendly intimacy means that ‘Hotel de la Poste’ surely
obtains the choicest examples of the harvest.

370 CHARI IS. 1970 2. ee at S89 42.00
Very dry, crisp, austere—ideal with summer seafood dishes.

The GREAT CHATEAUX
of BORDEAUX

Bottle their Private Reserves
in Dramatically Large Bottles

Some of their rarest treasures are now en route to our
cellars. Now is the time to acquire them.

All of the big bottles listed below will be available for de-
livery this September. They surely will be sought out by
wine collectors and all probably will be spoken for before
their arrival. Should you feel that life will not be complete
unless one of these extraordinary bottles is added to your
cellar, we suggest you phone immediately. Obviously, these
offerings are subject to prior sale since they are
irreplaceable.

The heritage of each of these is beyond flaw. All of the
Lafite-Rothschilds have been resting at the Chateau. The
same is true of the Haut Brion. The Dauzac and Pichon
Lalande come from the private cellar of Henri Woltner, at
Chateau La Mission Haut Brion.
