Mr. R. E. Alton, the bursar of St. Edmund Hall. It contains a charm-
ing report on the history of drinking at Oxford—we quote in part:

“All this is a preamble to a remarkable story: the link between
Sherry-Lehmann and St. Edmund Hall, the one a New York wine
merchant, founded in 1933, the other an institution of learning,
founded in the 13th Century—a story which is, in itself, something
of a turning-point in Anglo-American relationship. Some places
sell wine, and there is nothing very difficult in selling it. Others
(and how few of them there are!) vow wine, search out wines,
as one might furnish a great library. Sherry’s is such a place, and
this dedication involves a good deal of travel, a lot of knowledge
_..looking around for new sources of pleasure, for a place where
the cellars are still rich, still untouched. Oxford? Of course.

Everyone knows about the college cellars, the Senior Common
Room Port, the private stocks of whisky that are laid down, even
when the present Duke of Windsor was an undergraduate. They
are part of the Oxford tradition, the Oxford legend, like Magdalen
College’s famous deer, like Blackwell's bookshop, like the elegant
Gridiron Club, like the notorious Oxford mist (it would be called
a heavy fog in any other less romantic city ).

One no more expects to get at these stocks of
Port, Whisky, Sherry and Cognac, than one
expects to dine in New York off Magdalen
deer, or to bottle that famous Oxford mist.
Yet the thing has been done. One of the oldest
institutions in Oxford has permitted Sherry’s
to place on the market a limited supply of its
special selections. Nothing will be said of
them here, except that they are, in every sense,
worthy of their origin, remarkable bottles of
unique quality.”
