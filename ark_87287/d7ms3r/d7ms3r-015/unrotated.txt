The choicest vineyards of Alsace are on the slopes of the
Vosges Mountains starting from Mulhouse continuing north
to Strasbourg. The Alsatian wines are usually named after
the grape from which they are
Riesling, Gewurztraminer, etc. Their distinguishing char-
acteristics are flowery fragrance,

made such as Sylvaner,

relatively dry, but fruity.

There is more vineyard land in Spain than in any other
country in the world—less than 3% is Sherry. The best table
wines are from Rioja and some good ones are produced in
Valdepenas—also spottily in a few other provinces. Look
for the old vintage wines of Rioja which are among the best
values in outstanding red wine extant today.

WANDS APG 290) 2k. 1.49 16.50
Ernest Hemingway enjoyed visiting the cellars of Paternina
from where this wine comes. Look for earthy lustiness,
honesty and depth of flavor. A ‘best buy.’

SAN T-GCRIA, VAGO 2 1.59 17.28
If you do not want to go through the effort of buying one of
these Spanish red wines to make your own Sangria by adding
fruit juice, sugar syrup, and sparkling water, you can solve
the problem of buying this excellent prepared Sangria—now
becoming a national best-seller. Simply pour into a pitcher,
filled with ice, add cut fruit, club soda and serve on the
terrace, lawn, or at a beach party.

UT NOG ees 1.69 18.50
Produced by Rene Barbier, a French family that started to
grow wines almost a century ago in the Pinados region of
Catalonia, among the hills of Barcelona. Light, elegant, and
appropriate as a summer red wine, particularly if served
slightly cool.

GRAN RESERVA 1959. ooo: 2.49 26.90
As in Bordeaux, 1959 was a great year in Rioja. From private
reserves of Paternina.

MARQUIS RE RISCAL 1966.......... 2.39 27.97

On every important wine list from Gibraltar to Barcelona.

GRAN. RESERVA 1949... 4.99 53.90
The outstanding 1949 clarets command over $200 the case
in Bordeaux. Note how low, relatively, this Paternina classic
is. Frank Schoonmaker considers it one of the great red wines
of all Spain.
