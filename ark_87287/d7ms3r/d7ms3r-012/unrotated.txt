INTAGE
The 1970 white Burgundies proved elegant, graceful, fruity,
of excellent balance with an observable tendency towards
quick development. They might be considered a happy syn-
thesis of 66 and 62—high praise by any standard! Only two
have reached us—you will be delighted with them—with
more following later.

Bottle Case

MACON BLANC LUGNY ....... 1.99 22.50
Young, fresh, dry—similar to a Pouilly-Fuissé, only a few
miles away. The ideal everyday summer wine. From the
cellars of the Rt. Hon. Ernest Marples.

CHABLIS 2.19 24.50
Perhaps the most sensational offer of truly fine white Bur-
gundy in our history! Because of the high production, the
French Government require that the growers label the over-
production simply ‘Chablis’—although every drop of this
wine comes from a ‘Premier Cru’ vineyard which command
substantially higher prices. The grower in this instance is
Robert Vocoret, the Mayor of Chablis, who is renowned for
the excellence of his wine, particularly when gathered in
such an outstanding year as 1970. We can state that if this
wine were permitted to bear the name it rightfully deserves,
it would command double this price.

There is an up-to-date vintage chart in the book “How To
Fat Better For Less Money” which describes the 1969 vintage
in white Burgundy as follows, “like the red Burgundies, the
whites have been produced in limited quantity, are extremely
expensive and are truly great. Be on the lookout for them.
They are long-lived.”

PINOT CHARDONNAY ................-. 1.79 19.35
Estate-bottled, Union Vinicole de Lugny. Dry, clean, ex-
cellent for everyday drinking. With a teaspoon of Cassis it

mune of Chassagne-Montrachet. Estate-bottled, Bachelet-

There was much variation in quality from vineyard to vine-
yard in the 1967 vintage. Here are some outstanding ex-
amples of top-flight wines that 1967 produced.

CHABLIS VAULORENT ................-- 3.99 43.20
A ‘Premier Crw’ estate-bottled by Fevre. Excellent.
PERNAND-VERGELESSES ............. 3.99 43.10

Because this vineyard is not well known, it is relatively in-
expensive. A great value. Estate-bottled, Le Leure Piot.

CHASSAGNE-MONTRACHET

MORGEODR . . eee 4.99 53.90
The older brother to Bachelet—Ramonet family proudly
bears the name of Ramonet-Prudhon. The family vineyards
touch, and all share impeccable reputations for the excel-
lence of the white wines they produce.
CORTON CHARLEMAGNE ............ 8.25 89.10
This vineyard, the steepest in all of Burgundy, produces a
dry white wine that is often compared to Montrachet. Estate-
bottled, Le Leure Piot.
CHEVALIER MONTRACHET ....... 9.95 107.45
Deleger reached dramatic heights at this extraordinary vine-
yard in 1967.
MONTRACHET, LAGUICHE .......... 19.88 214.65
Rabelais always referred to this wine as “the divine Montra-
chet.” and Dumas proclaimed that “it should be drunk kneel-
ing and bareheaded.” The nobility of Burgundy has no
higher royalty than “le Montrachet,” generally considered
to be the greatest dry white wine of the world. The one
produced by Marquis Laguiche is considered the ‘King’ even
within this exalted company.
