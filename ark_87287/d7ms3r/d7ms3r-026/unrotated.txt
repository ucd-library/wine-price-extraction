THE WINES OF HUNGARY

The wines of Hungary, particularly Tokay, have been famous for
centuries. Don’t let the difficult names discourage you—you can find
superb wines at low cost here. Try Tokay—it is an experience.

THE WINES OF CHILE

The history of wine making goes back to the mid 16th Century in
Chile and there are many wine critics who consider it the best of the
non-European wines. Below we offer only the best of Chile—wines
made from noble grape varieties and from the best sections of the
vineyard. You will find them astonishingly good—they bear little
resemblance to the pleasant, non-descript little Chilean wines that
have been shipped to the United States up to now.

622 CABERNET SAUVIGNON 1966 1.98 22.00
Here is the great grape of Bordeaux producing a full-flavored
red wine, deep in color, long-lived, and capable of thriving
for another two decades.

634. PINOT NOIR 1965 ; 1.98 22.00

‘Pinot Noir’ is the grape that produces the great red Bur-

gundies. It has flourished beautifully here in the soil of

Chile. Will match red Burgundies that sell between $3.00

and $3.50 the bottle.

PINOT BLANC 1966 oe 1.98 22.00

The white wine grape that provides the basis for many white

Burgundies. Finesse, dryness and character are the character-

istics here.

THE WINES OF PORTUGAL

We think of Portugal in terms of port wine, but in truth, over 90%
produced is table wine. Some of the world’s best selling wines, such
as Lancers and Mateus, come from Portugal. The best white is Vinho
Verde—and the best red is Dao.

RED WINES

bodied, heavy and fruity.

RED BORDEAUX
1967 REGIONALS

each of these wines traces its origin to a specific vineyard, placing
them into a more thoroughbred class. Ideally suited for drinking
