Bottle Case
MARCEL PERE BRUT 4.99 58.50

An astonishing Champagne opportunity. The wine is com-
pletely dry, surprisingly good and sensationally priced. Half
bottles are available at $2.75 each, $63.50 the case of 24—
Magnums at $11.00 each, $63.50 the case of 6—and there are
the handy Splits at only $1.49 each!

MESNIL BRUT, BLANC

DE BLANCS ne 2.99 68.50
Every drop is made exclusively out of white wine pressed
from white grapes, in the choicest wine growing town of
Champagne—MESNIL. The grower is Veuve Galien, proudly
featured by Nicolas of Paris, and can seriously be considered
as the best value among the great Champagnes of France.
JAMIN BRUT 1966 (Roederer)... 5.99 68.50
From the distinguished cellar of Theophile Roederer. It was
the firm Roederer that owned the famed trotting horse
‘Jamin’ that won the world’s championship. This 1966 reflects
the youthful freshness and intrinsic excellence of the famed
1966 vintage. Available in half bottles at $3.29 each, $73.50
the case of 24.

AYALA GOLD LABEL BRUT

1964.00 6.49 73.50
Those of you who have travelled through the capitals of
Europe have seen the Ayala featured on the most prominent
wine lists of Paris, London and Rome. It represents an ex-
alted Champagne class in Europe, but its virtues have not
yet been recognized nationally by the American Champagne
fanciers. Because of this it thus becomes possible for you to
acquire a world famous vintage Champagne for $6.49 instead
of the customary $10.00 the bottle that its counterparts com-
mand in the United States. Also available in Magnum at
$13.96 each, $78.50 the case of six.

MESNIL, BLANC DE BLANCS

NOGA ee ea 6.99 79.50
We quote from the London Financial Times, “Some prefer
a Champagne with a good deal of ‘winey’ flavour, others go
for freshness and delicacy; hence the vogue for ‘Blanc de
Blancs’.” Here is a young, beautifully balanced example from
the outstanding 1964 vintage.

LEDOYEN, BLANC DE BLANCS,

WOG4e eae: 7.49 84.00
Ledoyen, the beautiful restaurant on the Champs Elysees is
now acknowledged as one of the gastronomic shrines of
France. The proprietor, Gilbert Lejeune, born in the Cham-
pagne district, takes his Champagne seriously. This remark-
ably excellent Blanc de Blancs will please the most
demanding.

CHARLES HEIDSIECK BRUT........ 8.49 91.69
Why did we single out this Charles Heidsieck? Simply be-
cause in recent blind tastings among non-vintage Cham-
pagnes it has consistently received the highest ratings, thus
making it an outstanding value in world Champagne. Dry,
well-balanced, flavorsome.

ANSON BRUM eee 8.55 92.28
Lanson is one of the Great Champagne houses of France and
their Special Cuvee marked ‘Brut’ represents a beautiful
harmony of dryness, bouquet and well rounded taste
qualities.

KRUG BRUT RESERVE.................. 9.95 109.35
There are those connoisseurs who claim that this non-vintage
is the best Champagne produced in France, and even sur-
passes other vintage Champagnes. This statement is subject
to argument, but what is certain, is that we truly are dealing
with a great and very highly flavorsome Champagne.
LOUIS ROEDERER BRUT 1964... 9.95 107.50
During the great vintage year of 1964, Louis Roederer
achieved a high point with this Champagne. Bone-dry,
mostly from vineyards owned by Roederer, highly sophisti-
cated in taste and truly excellent.

BOLLINGER ED. 1959 is: 15.50 167.40
What is R.D.? It means ‘recently disgorged. This means
that this 1959 has rested in the Bollinger cellars until a few
months ago—the old cork was removed—and the new one
was inserted. This retains the freshness of this superb 1959
and it will give you the privilege of tasting an old vintage
that is not only remarkable today, but will be good even five
years hence. Certainly one of the greatest Champagnes we
have ever tasted from the Bollinger cellars. Quantity limited.

MOET & CHANDON
DOM PERIGNON 1962 167.94

The entire world now knows that Dom Perignon is the

15.55

symbol of Champagne’s outstanding excellence—not only
in terms of the beautiful bottle in which it is presented
but also by virtue of the excellence of the wine within the
bottle. There is no more 1962 in the cellars of Moet & Chan-
don or in the inventory of Schieffelin, the importers. We
have but 40 cases left and then we will present the succeed-
ing vintage—1964. Should you want 1962 for your Fall enter-
taining, now is the time to acquire it because our holdings
are irreplaceable. Should you want 1964, it has just reached
us, and at the same price.

AMERICAN CHAMPAGNES

In the October issue of Gourmet magazine, Hugh Johnson, the
eminent wine authority of Britain comments, “Schramsberg, the

winery that Robert Louis Stevenson so delighted in

once again

embodies everything that is most seductive about California... the
replanting of the breathing vineyards with the best vines of Cham-
pagne...to sit in the shade and drink the delicate uplifting Schrams-
berg wine seems to me as much as any man of goodwill can ask from

life.”

ANDRE MONCIER BRUT 2.99 34.75
The American Champagnes produced in the Finger Lakes
district of New York generally command over $4.00 the
bottle. We will match this one, beautifully made and delight-
fully dry, with any of them, and at only $2.99.

TAYLOR BRUT 4.70 50.76
Fruitier and more typically eastern in taste than the other
New York State Finger Lake Champagnes shown here.

GOLD SEAL BRUT 41.90 a2.92
The Finger Lakes provides this dry and relatively fruity
Champagne.

ALMADEN BRUT 4.95 53.46

An outstanding example of dry California Champagne.

GREAT WESTERN BRUT 4.99 53.89
Another example of New York State Finger Lake Cham-
pagnes. Popular throughout the United States.

KORBEL BRUT 56.70
Consistently wins the highest award among American Cham-
pagnes when placed competitively in blind tastings against
European counterparts.
BEAULIEU VINEYARD
PRIVATE RESERVE BRUT 1964 6.65 71.82
Made in Napa Valley, but produced in the classic European
tradition. Outstanding.
SCHRAMSBERG BLANC DE
BLANCS 1968

3.29

6.99 79.50

If a Dom Perignon is ever produced in northern California,
it will probably happen at this small, but excellent Schrams-
berg vineyard. Dedication to quality is remarkable and is
reflected in the beautiful dryness and balance achieved. Only
100 cases a year allocated to New York.
