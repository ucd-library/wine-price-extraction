1961 CHATEAU BOTTLED

The vintage was so good that even the humblest of growths
made first class wines. Since nearly everyone seemed to have
made a good ’61, it might make good economic sense to stay
away from the First Growths here. Possibly the greatest
vintage of this generation.

Bottle Case

CHATEAU LYNCH BAGES.............. 7.99 86.30
Pauillac. We suspect it can take on a First Growth of a lesser
year.
CARRUADES DE CHATEAU

PAPITE ROTHSCHILD |... oo)... 14.50 156.60
Makes a serious bid to being the best value in truly great
claret extant. Its heritage is the Lafite vineyard and its vin-
tage year is 1961. Big, glorious, ready now.

day seven years hence. He picked Chateau Latour 1961.

A collector’s item. Great.

1959 CHATEAU BOTTLED

Though less concentrated than 1961, and hailed as the “Vin-
tage of the Century,” the 59s are nevertheless intrinsically
great, despite the dramatic publicity. All of these can be en-
joyed today, with the better ones endowed with at least two
decades of vitality ahead.
