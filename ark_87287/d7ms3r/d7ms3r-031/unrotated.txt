Presenting a Remarkable Collection

of Rare Vintage Port

If you have not yet experienced the pleasurable wine-drinking joy
of vintage port that proudly bears the date of the harvest on its label,
we strongly advise that you try one of the noblest of the world’s
great wines—in its own way, in the same exalted class as a Chateau
Lafite, Haut Brion or a Romanee Conti. Whether it be in front of a
warming fireplace when the wintry gales are roaring outside, or
whether it be on sunlit terrace saluting the advent of summer, there
is always an honored place after the dinner party for noble vintage
port.

Not a fashionable year in Bordeaux or Burgundy, but it proved most
excellent on the sunny slopes of the Alto Douro.

wine event—these old Madeiras have provided one of the
great wine tasting experiences of my life.”

Richard Hooper was once the Lord Mayor of

In 1790, George Sandeman decided that his native city in Scotland
offered little scope for his talents and he went south to Oporto to
seek his fortune. He succeeded because Sandeman is now the most
important wine export firm of Oporto.
