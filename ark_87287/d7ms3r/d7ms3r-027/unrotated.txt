THE WINES OF AMERICA

To put it all in perspective, California produces over 80% of the
wine consumed in the United States—about 10% coming from for-
eign countries—and the remaining 10% come from other states,
chiefly New York. It should also be remembered that California’s
wine is made almost exclusively from European grape varieties and
bears a taste similarity to the wines of the Continent. All other wines
made in the United States come either from native American grapes,
or from hybrids. Generally speaking, these Eastern wines have little
in common with those made in Europe. However, there are excep-
tions that you will find below.

THE SMALL VINEYARDS
OF CALIFORNIA

They exist. They have been consumed voraciously and with pride by
the local wine-loving Californians and there never was enough for
exporting beyond the borders of this wine-proud western State. A
minor miracle has happened. Four of the best growers have gra-
ciously shipped some of their best wines eastward to satisfy the
enthusiasm and curiosity of New Yorkers who would like to experi-
ence the best that California can produce. Some of them can take on
a top-flight Chassagne-Montrachet or a Chateau Leoville Lascases.
You might serve some of these wines (label not shown) at a dinner
party. We predict that your friends will rave about the wine and
will be astonished when you tell them that the origin is northern
California.

The four small vineyards we talk about appear below. They are

HANZELL; RIDGE; FREEMARK ABBEY; and CHAPPELLET.

NAPA VALLEY WINES

This fortunate valley is only 35 miles long and from one to five miles
wide. If ever a great red wine will be born in America, it will prob-
ably take place in this valley.

CHAPPELLET VINEYARD

The Pritchard hill from its lofty 1,900 ft. altitude, towers
over the Napa Valley. The temperature is cool; the vines
struggle to survive. It is out of such struggle that wines of
finesse and breed are born. These hills are evidently choice
vineyard land because cultivation can be traced back to the
°80s. Don Chappellet is rightfully proud of what he produces
here. His Chenin Blanc can take on Pouilly-Fumé and his
Riesling need not bow before a good Rhine wine.

FREEMARK ABBEY

Freemark Abbey is a familiar name in the early history of
California. The director, Charles Carpy, is a 3rd generation
California wine-maker. His devotion to quality is the talk
of wine-lovers in that State. His Cabernet Sauvignon 1967
can equal a classified chateau of Bordeaux and win as much
enthusiasm. His Pinot Chardonnay 1968 would be con-
sidered top-flight even in Burgundy.

LOUIS M. MARTINI
The Martini vineyards are south of St. Helena, adjoining
Beaulieu. They have been extended to Monte Rosso, high
up in the Mayacamas Hills of Sonoma. The wines produced
here have enjoyed a reputation for outstanding excellence

since the 730s.

BEAULIEU VINEYARD

Visiting Beaulieu Vineyard is not far removed from visiting
a great Chateau in Bordeaux. You will discover a beautiful
turn-of-the-century house, classic gardens, and great wines in
the cellar.

SONOMA VALLEY

The valley starts at the town of Sonoma which overlooks San Fran-
cisco Bay, continues north—generally as cool as Burgundy and beau-
tifully adapted to wine-growing. The bigger vineyards are Sebastiani
and Buena Vista. The jewel of the valley is the Hanzell vineyard
which produces what many consider perhaps the greatest red and
white wines of America.

HANZELL VINEYARDS

Our late former Ambassador to Italy, James D. Zellerbach,
loved wines, and particularly those of Burgundy. In the 30s,
he built the Hanzell Winery as a replica of part of the famed
Clos de Vougeot Burgundy vineyard. After his death in 1963,
it was acquired by the Douglas Days who continue to con-
centrate on only two noble grape varieties—Pinot Char-
donnay and Pinot Noir. Both are superb. Both are rationed.
Both are worth acquiring.
