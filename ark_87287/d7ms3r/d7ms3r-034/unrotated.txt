Though the wine name ‘Sherry’ has been
adapted as a generic term in many wine-
growing areas of the world, historically, au-
thentic Sherry reaches its apex at and traces
its origin from a specific area in southern
Spain, surrounding the little city of Jerez
de la Frontera. All of the Sherries which you
see below come from this highly regarded
district. Many consider these Sherries of Spain
the best aperitif wines of the world—and in
the Summer they are particularly refreshing

when served over the rocks or iced .

If you are interested in acquiring top-flight
Sherries from this area at modest cost. we
can unreservedly recommend those from the
firm of J. M. RIVERO—the oldest Sherry firm
in all of Spain, established during the early
17th Century. Each one that you see below
will prove, in comparative tastings, as out-
standing within its class.
