APERITIFS
Aperitifs are the national drinks of the Continent, particularly in
warm weather—the outdoor café, restaurant terrace, overlooking a
river or mountain—or as the mild, pleasing introduction to the re-
past. Why not do the same thing here this Summer, whether it be in
your town apartment or at your vacation address ?

DRY VERMOUTHS

The predominant use of dry Vermouth is in the dry Martini. Now
it has become fashionable (particularly for those who want to lose
weight) to drink it straight over the rocks with a twist of lemon peel.
Another popular drink is simply to add a teaspoon of Cassis and
some ice cubes, thus creating the much appreciated ‘Vermouth

Cassis.’

Even without the use of pigment color, JEAN COROT managed to
suggest the colors of trees, land and sky. Here is a reproduction of his
lithograph, Souvenir D’Italie, which he executed in 1871.
