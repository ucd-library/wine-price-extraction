The name ‘Champagne’ is guarded jealously in France and only
sparkling wines produced in the strictly delimited Champagne dis-
trict are entitled to bear the name. However, some intriguing spark-

ling wines, without the name ‘Champagne’ are made in other parts
of France, particularly the Loire and Rhone Valleys and in the
mountainous countryside of the Haut-Savoie. As you can see below

the cost is considerably less, and for those who enjoy ‘good bubbly

wine, and do not want to spend too much, some extraordinary

opportunities exist here.

SPARKLING “COLD DUCK”

What is ‘Cold Duck’? We know it is a blend of sparkling red and
sparkling white wine that has become a current fad in much of
America. Perhaps this is because it bears a taste similarity to ‘spark-
ling Coca-Cola’ which is an integral part of the American scene. It
all started with a German nobleman, who, after a hunt, would serve
a punch consisting of sparkling red and white wines. We have con-
ducted comparative tastings, and we list below the three we like the

best.

ITALIAN RED WINES

Bottle Case
CHIANTI RISERVA 1966 1.99 21.50

Marchesi Corsini owns some of the best vineyard land of
Tuscany and this ‘Riserva’ is outstanding. Worth at least
$1.00 the bottle more. Also available in Magnums at 4.56
each, 24.50 the case of 6.

LAMBRUSCO DI SORBARA 1.99 21.50

Unusual red wine produced just west of Bologna. Extremely
fruity, slightly sweet, with exceptional bouquet.

VALPOLICELLA 1966 2.19 23.65
Pleasing, fruity, light. Cantina Sociale.
BARDOLINO 1964 2.19 23.65

Frank Schoonmaker selected this refreshing, fruity, light
red wine grown along the shores of Lake Garda. Low price
for its outstanding quality.

BAROLO 1964 2.99 32.30
Here again, Frank Schoonmaker is proud of this discovery
which he founded among the hills of Piedmont. We share his
opinion that Barolo is perhaps the best red wine of all Italy;
full-bodied, slow-maturing and comparable to a top flight
Rhone Valley red. Generally kept at least three years in wood
and then put in ‘Burgundy’ bottles. Powerful, definitely be-
longs in the ranks of great red wines.

ITALIAN WHITE WINES

FRASCATI 1969 ci eee 19.35
While dining at the Grand Hotel in Rome, we were amazed
by the Frascati they served us—way beyond the class of any
other we experienced. The Grand Hotel Manager then told
us that it comes from the Valle Vermiglia vineyard, owned
by Pietro Campilli, now President of Italy’s National Eco-
nomic Council and until recently, President of Edison
Montecatini. Perhaps it was his devotion to excellence in
whatever field he may be engaged in that permitted Mr.
Campilli to produce this thoroughly agreeable and refresh-
ing white wine—the kind of wine that provides carefree
companionship to the easy pleasantness of summer living.

CHIANTI BIANCO SECCO 1968 1.99 21.50
Marchesi Corsini, who has sent us his remarkable Chianti
Riserva listed above, has accompanied the shipment with
some of his excellent dry white, grown in Tuscany. Made
from the Trebbiano grape, it is dry, golden, and relatively
full bodied. The best of class—and priced remarkably low.

SOAVE 1969 2.19 23.65
Perhaps we are prejudiced, but we consider this the best
dry white wine of all Italy. Cantina Sociale.

ORVIETO DRY ee 2.24 24.19
From Umbria. In squat straw bottle. Dry, Bigi.
VERDICCHIO 1966 . 2 cco 24.73

Grown near Adriatic. In amphora bottle. Dry, very light,
pale, fresh. From the ‘Castelli di Jesi? vineyards which sets
the standard for all other Verdicchios.

RAVELLO ROSA oe So 2a 27.49
Although not white, but rosé in color, we think this wine
is too good and too important to be excluded from among
the Italian wines. Some of you may have visited this delight-
ful little town of Ravello overlooking Amalfi and may have
eaten at the enchanting inn, owned by the brothers Caruso
who produce this colorful dry and utterly pleasant pink wine.
