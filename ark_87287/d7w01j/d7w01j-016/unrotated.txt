Of course, if you are interested in the German e

would be for a wine of the Saar, of a mediocre year, like 1963 or 1965, but there ‘are
plenty of Rheingaus which will delight you. Buy, if possible, the lesser wine of a great
estate.

For something better, if you want the counterpart of a Bordeaux chateau wine or a
Burgundy estate-bottling, I can only suggest that you follow the pattern of the Wine Lists
of good German Hotels and Restaurants. Here you will find NONE of our popular

Peering into the future, our advice is to
get hold of these good estate-bottlings.
They are rapidly disappearing from the
German scene. Since 1968 borders on a
disaster in Germany except for a few
unusually good wines that represent no
more than 5% of the total, it is quite
obvious that there will be a marked price
increase for the authentic estate-bottlings
of Germany in the near future.

We know that we will not be able to
duplicate these values— and we equally
know that any astute wine-lover will an-
ticipate his Spring and Summer needs for
German wines now while this vast assort-
ment of excellence is available at these
extraordinarily low prices.
