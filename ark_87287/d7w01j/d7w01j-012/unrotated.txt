QUEEN ANNE—has been a
consistent favorite for over a
century in Britain and in its
colonies. Well-balanced, flavor-
some, and maturely soft. A
Scotch opportunity not to be
ignored. Quarts or fifths.

CUT THIS ouUT

FORTNUM & MASON has
been a symbol of quality
through the reign of twelve
sovereigns. Here is their dis-
tinguished Scotch—the favorite
of the London critical—at an
intriguing sale price.

OLD GENTRY is a favorite
gin among the British gentry.
It is surely the equal of many
British gins that command a
considerably higher price. A
full 94.8 proof. Priced dramat-

ically low.

Have you ever tasted OLD
RARITY? Until recently, it com-
manded an extraordinarily high
premium price. You will find it
here at a cost that will astonish
you.

DOUGLAS—The proud product
of one of Scotland’s oldest distil-
leries where it is bottled after long
aging. A consistent favorite. Both
quarts and fifths are on sale.
