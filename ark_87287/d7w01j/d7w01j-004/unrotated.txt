of the most important and best-tended vineyards of the Graves district,
south of Bordeaux.” It was classified in 1953 among the eleven top
Graves vineyards making red wines — a classification that also in-
cludes Chateau Haut Brion and Chateau La Mission Haut Brion. To
understand why it was possible for Chateau Bouscaut to provide the
wine-drinking world with such aged and treasured red wines, we quote
from Alexis Lichine’s Encyclopedia, ““Bouscaut continues the aging
and selling of its wine in bottle — a practice instituted long ago by
the Place family. Few large vineyards could start today the expensive
process ‘of having to wait over a number of years, without income,
before selling bottle-aged wines; but behind the barrel-stores at
Bouscaut are a dozen room-sized lockers containing thousands of
bottles of wine being aged.” It is from this TREASURE CELLAR
that we offer you the range of vintages from 1949 through 1967.

And only recently, the WALL STREET JOURNAL reported the ac-
quisition of this vineyard, Chateau Bouscaut, by a small -group of
United States businessmen led by Charles Wohlstetter, Chairman of
Continental Telephone, Howard Sloan, insurance executive, and Allan
Meltzer, public relations consultant. This follows the tradition of the
Dillon family who own Chateau Haut Brion and Alexis Lichine and
his American associates who also acquired Chateau Lascombes.

And earlier this winter, in the LONDON OBSERVER, Cyril Ray, one
of Britain’s leading wine critics states, “The Clarets of the Graves
district, except Chateau Haut Brion, have not been as publicized or

have become as famous as they deserve to be, and
many of them therefore, I consider to be under-
priced compared with the finest Medocs.

“On two or three occasions recently”, continues
Mr. Ray, “‘I have tasted current vintages of
Chateau Bouscaut, a fine, full-bodied, yet far from
heavy wine, grown on a famous property only a
five-mile bus ride from the center of Bordeaux.
Chateau Bouscaut is typical of red Graves in de-
veloping more quickly than a comparable Medoc,
yet lasting as long: for example, I found a 1964
remarkably forward—very ready to drink, indeed
—yet showing every sign of being worth putting
away for from three to five years.”
