Although we live in an age of constant change, ancient records indicate that the good =

Q
Sherry firm of J. M. Rivero has maintained quality leadership and continuity of existence ays

 

from the early 17th Century until today. The annals relate that a cargo of Rivero Sherry
was seized by Admiral Nelson’s officers off Trafalgar Cape. The barrels found their
way back to the House of Rivero and it is these very casks that form the basis for

some of Rivero’s world-renowned Soleras.

Candidly, we are convinced that the excellence and dedication of Rivero provides here
a most unique opportunity for the appreciative Sherry fancier to acquire some of Spain’s
finest fortified wines, ranging from the bone-dry to the luxurious, dramatic Cream
Sherry at astonishingly low prices... prices made possible only by a large-scale pur-

chase in which the savings are passed on to you.

These Sherries normally command between $3.50 and $6.75 the bottle. Here are
sensational savings that should not be ignored.

No. Bottle Case

il PRO S BUN@ EREZ 0, yn 25 ee,

A light, dry, delicate wine; pale, straw-colored; the typical, unmistakable bouquet of a Fino, slightly reminiscent
of almonds. The aperitif wine of Spain, ideal with hors d’oeuvres, consommé, and shell fish. Serve chilled as an
interesting change from the dry Martini.

RIVERO’S ‘“*STROCADERO” AMONTILLADO . .

A good Amontillado develops out of the Fino family, acquiring its own unique characteristics as it matures; the

color becomes more amber-like, the flavor more nutty, and there is more depth in body. Its nearest counterpart in
our cellars commands $3.89.

RIVEROS EAST INDIA” AMOROSO. .. .

The East India Amoroso obtained its name from the practice in the days of sailing vessels of sending casks of
Sherry aboard ship to the East Indies and back. The saying was, “the sea-sick wines of Jerez are worth double.”
The color is amber and the flavor is rich and full, occupying a mid-point between dryness and sweetness.

BIVER@S CARRASCAL CREAM... . .

The richer and older of the Olorosos bear the name ‘Cream’ Sherry. This concept was developed in Bristol, Eng-
land and Cream Sherries are extremely popular throughout the English-speaking world, particularly in the U.S.

Cream Sherry of this age and character, medium dry and dramatically rich, generally commands between $4.85
and $6.75 the bottle.
