Special to The New York Times

Mr. Aaron emphatically denies that
one must have great wealth or an elab-
orate cellar to have a comfortable col-
lection of wines.

“For those who can afford to spend
$250 for eight cases, a customer can
buy and watch the wine develop under
his own roof,” he said. “They can give
their guests the privilege of picking
their own wines and as each two cases
is consumed thev can be replaced” with
wines of more recent vintage.

“And there’s the almost certain
knowledge that the wines will almost
double in value every two years.”

Reproduced above is an excerpt from an article by Craig Claiborne, that appeared recently in the New York
Times. We have received an extraordinary number of inquiries requesting guidelines for the proper procedure
in laying down a "Basic Cellar" as described by Craig Claiborne.

 

 

Our recommendations appear below. We have proceeded on the basis of our philosophy that "wine drinking

should be an adventuresome Odyssey among the best vineyards of the world" to provide a maximum number of
experiences. This permits you to determine, yourself, which wines are most pleasing to you, rather than

simply relying on the gospel as handed down by wine experts.

The "Basic 6 Case Cellar" consists of two bottles each of 36 different wines, totalling six cases ($200.00).

The "Supplementary 2 Case Cellar" consists of two bottles each of 12 different wines, totalling two cases ($50.00).

THE BASIC 6 CASE CELLAR - $200.00 COMPLETE

These 72 bottles would cost you $229.02 if purchased individually.
