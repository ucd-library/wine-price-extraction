leading wine authorities, of the vintages
of the last decade in the great
wine-growing regions of France and Germany

 

Epitor’s Note: Mr. Aaron, Presi-
dent of Sherry Wine and Spirits
Co., is often called on to talk
about wine to professional and
non-professional groups and has
led some heated panel discussions
on radio. His inside information
comes from constant tasting and
yearly visits to the European vine-
yards to sample the new vintages.

A review of the last ten years
might well lead us to believe that
we are an unusually blessed gener-
Certainly
never before in history has one
decade produced three “vintages
of the century.” After the highly
publicized 1959’s had been quick-
ly followed by the exalted 1961’s,
the drums began to beat for the
most Heralded vintage of all—
1964. The more skeptical among
us may ask whether this is truly
an extraordinary creation of na-
ture’s merely a
pleasant myth created by reports
in newspapers, by wine growers,
and by the writers of vintage
charts. In my opinion, the reports
went way beyond reality. True,
these were really great years, but
the wine was not the nectar of the
gods that many people thought.

Personally, I do not approve
of the popular practice of carrying
a small, laminated wine chart,
grading the wines of each year
from 0 to 10. Enticing as they are
in their simplicity, these numbers
tell nothing about whether the
wine is too young or too old by
the time you drink it. An old vint-
age date on a label may prove to
be only the attractive facade of a
wine that is old and tired and
should have been consumed much
earlier in its life, while it still had
its fruit and flavor. Nor do the
charts draw any distinction be-
tween wines of a common heri-
tage such as the many Burgundies
aad Bordeaux, yet a wine that
comes from poor vineyard soil can
never reach the heights, no mat-
ter how great the year of its birth.
By oversimplification, vintage
charts often result in artific ially
high prices for the much_publi-
cized years, and anyone canny
and knowledgeable enough can
find really good wine of the so-
called “off years” at bargain
prices. As with human beings, in
wine there is always some good i in
the bad and some bad in the good.

Here is an attempt, based on
research, dozens of tastings, and
many interviews, to formulate
some rules for the wine drinker’s
guidance. We start with Bordeaux,
iihere vintage plays the most sig-
nificant aie

Bordeaux are the most long-lived
red wines of the world because of
their high tannin content—the
most important single ingredient
Here are the
only red wines that often take a
decade to and can still
prove to be vigorous after a half-
century of aging.

The timetable of maturation
varies from year to year. The °54’s
and ’56’s are long gone; the °58’s
and ’60’s, delightful now, have not
too many years ahead. The °57’s
are at present hard and unattrac-
tive and perhaps might not be soft
and pleasing for still another dec-
ade. The ’63’s are best skipped or

their bottling.
The excellent °55’s are just

coming into their own, soon to be
followed by the fine, soft, outstand-
ing *62’s. Next in the timetable
are the great °59’s which can be
enjoyed today and still have a
decade of glory ahead. We also
suspect that the fruity, charming
°64’s will delight all serious wine
drinkers for at least ten years, al-
though they will never match the
longevity of the truly great, con-
centrated ’6l’s. It is the first-
growth °61’s that should be set
aedes in your cellar, forgotten, and
served twenty years hence as pos-
sibly the most remarkable clarets
of the century.

White Bordeaux

The rich white wines of Bordeaux
(Sauternes and Barsac) require
an overabundance of sunshine that
must extend into the harvest sea-
son for them to achieve greatness.
Consequently, the white Bordeaux
failed in 1964, despite the heights
achieved by the red wines, be-
cause October rain prevented
complete maturation. These sweet
white wines achieved great breed,
depth, and fruit, However, in ’62,
°61, and ’59.

The drier white wines of
Graves, which are picked earlier,
achieved delicacy and finesse in
1964. Do not look for the older
years in these wines—they are
too risky and may have lost their
freshness—but concentrate on the

vintages of 61, 62, and 64.

Red Burgundy

The vineyard soil as well as the
reputation of the grower plays a
most significant part in the wines
of Burgundy, even more than in
Bordeaux. Since there are so
many mediocre wines that bear
exalted Burgundian names and
vintages, should exercise
greater care in their selection

your cellar, it would be wise to

drink them up within the near fu-
ture—next in the timetable would
be the °59’s. The ’62’s are excellent,
quick maturing, and you can start
enjoying them now. If you are for-
tunate in possessing any of the
°61’s, it would be wise to let them
rest for at least another year or
two before savoring their virtues.
Avoid the dismal ’63’s, and ’60’s.
The °57’s are hard and, in general,
not to be recommended; and the
°58’s, picked too early, are on the
whole, poor. Those growers who
had the courage to pick their 58's
later than their have
been rewarded and have produced
remarkable wine, despite
demnation from the vintage charts.

Happily, the ’64’s are starting
to arrive, rich in fruit, balance,
and charm. They will not last
much beyond 1972, but will give
a lovely light during their brief,
brilliant existence.

White Burgundies

A very sunny year may make great
red wine, but it often imparts too
much alcohol and_ insufficient
acidity to white wine, thus inter-
fering with balance. This was the
tragedy of the 1959 white Bur-
gundies, glorious in their youth,
but now gone. As a safety measure,
it would be a wise idea to avoid
any white Burgundy that predates
1961. For present drinking, there
are the delightful, fragrant, and
harmonious ’62’s—soon to be fol-
lowed by equally excellent ’64’s

For those who like older
white Burgundies, there is only
one year to pick—1961. Here is a
wine that is beginning to show its
depth of flavor now, is slowly-un-
folding, and promises, at least
from the better vineyards, to be
good a decade hence. There are
some fine ’63’s, but since they are
not so well-known, the probability
is that very few of them will ever
reach the United States.

Rhines and Moselles

Except for Beerenauslese and
other rare, expensive, very sweet
wines, avoid any German
that predate 1959. Interestingly
enough, the ’59’s, the greatest year
since the war, have conserved their
freshness and fruit, losing only
their early oversweetness, and
promise to outlive any of their
successor years.

The 60's. 6¥s, and’ 0272
have proven light, fragrant, gen-
erally dry, pleasant, and most use-
ful. But there is no doubt that the
°64’s, just starting to put in their
appearance, represent the best
vintage since 1959. They have tre-
mendous style and charm, coupled

occasions acquire the great Spaet-
lese and Auslese of 1959.

Rhone Valley

There was great joy everywhere
in Europe during the harvest of
1964 except in the Rhone Valley
where a severe spring hailstorm
affected quantity and quality ad-
versely. This particularly
tragic since it was on the heels of
a poor 1963. But all is not gloom:
the growers here can boast of light,
fine ’62’s. The ’59’s did not share
the success of the rest of France,
producing satisfactory, although

Since youth is a virtue among the
white wines of the Loire, it fol-

Champagne

Since most Champagne bears no

Champagnes are a blend of wines
from various districts, “vintage”
in Champagne does not have the
same meaning as in other wines.
After a_ particularly
harvest, the world-famous Cham-
pagne houses customarily declare
it a vintage year. They then start
the delicate task of blending a
wine that will be characteristic of
that particular year while retain-
ing the traditional qualities that
identify the well-known brand.
