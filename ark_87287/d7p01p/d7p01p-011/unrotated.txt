Shipping Information

The growth of interest in wine
has blanketed the nation, and every-
where can be found wine merchants
who have learned, and are eager to
serve their clients’ wishes. Armed
with this wine-buying guide, there
is every reason to believe that, no
matter where vou live, a dealer can
obtain for you (even if he does not
have it in stock) the wine library
that you specify and at approxi-
mately the prices listed above. Even
if you reside in an area where wine
distribution is a monopoly of the
state government, the state liquor

stores will generally try and satisfy
your request on special order, pro-
vided you give them enough time.

It may take some slight courage
and determination on your part to

become the sudden parent of a li-

brary of wines, but surely it is

    

better to start with 30 bottles and
an investment of $100 rather than
forego the pleasure the collection
will certainly give your friends,
your family, and yourself. The great-
est dividend, although intangible,
will be purely emotional. I have
done this often enough and feel
sufficiently strongly about it to
state that there is probably no more
exciting and glamorous gift one can
send a newly-married couple than
a library of wines, perhaps accom-
panied by a book on the subject,
and a few good inexpensive wine
glasses. Since my calendar indi-
cates that Christmas is not far off,
and some of you may share my
restless feeling about acquiring “the
gift that will really matter” you
might consider sending a “pocket
library of wines.’ And I somewhat
hesitantly mention you might get
the best of it in the end: The gift
will lead to a dinner invitation; the
wines will be good because you
selected them; and the hostess will
have to go to extra effort to pro-
duce food to match the wine.

The selections above have beén
rigidly limited to wines that nature
has produced without any further
alcoholic embellishment by man.
This does not mean that a complete
wine cellar can afford to ignore
Sherry, Port, and Madeira, where
man has fortified what nature has
done by the addition of Brandy, nor
can a home overlook the basic
spirits and whiskies. Certainly, the
more adventurous should seek out
the unique specialties of the world.

you should consider in order to

achieve a well-rounded selection.
