348 BIENVENUE BATARD MONTRACHET 1961 .................. 4.79 52.75
(Estate bottled, C. Ramonet)

Like its next door neighbor “Le Montrachet,” this is truly one of the great white wines of the world. Quantity is limited so
we suggest ordering early.

Po eee ee faatll BRION BEANC 1960 ...- 2... 0. cee ee 4.99 54.95

This wondrous dry white wine of Bordeaux showed unusual dryness, freshness and character in 1960. The lack of sunshine
was almost a blessing. And there are also a few case of Magnums at the same price.

oat MEURSAULT, CLOS DES PERRIERES, 1961 2... =. 0.0.6.0 oe. 4.99 54.95
(Estate bottled, A. Grivault)

Probably the best Meursault that we have tasted in a decade. We do not think it would take second place even to good
Montrachet.

785 WEHLENER SONNENUHR SPATLESE 1959 (Orig. Abf., J. Prum) ...4.99 54.95

The name “J. Prum” on a Wehlener of a great year is synonymous with Moselle at its best. Normally $7.

mo CHATEAU HAUT BRION BLANC 17961 (Graves) ...........080. 5.69 62.75
The greatest dry white wine of Bordeaux. Produced in only limited quantities. A favorite among lovers of great white wine.
655 CHEVALIER MONTRACHET 1961 (Estate bottled, Lochardet) ..... 6.49 71.50

Chevalier Montrachet is the best vineyard after Montrachet itself. There are only 15 acres in all and drinkers throughout the
world compete for its precious wine.

ooo Cle te 1 YOUERM 1959 (Sautcmes) .. -. 2... ... ee 6.99 77.00
Chateau d’Yquem at its best. Rivals the 1921. Dramatically rich.
604 SCHLOSS VOLLRADS BEERENAUSLESE 1959 (In half bottle) ....8.95195.00

Rich, full, dramatic—serve by itself at end of a meal for exciting taste experience—hence the advantage of the half bottle.

36 MARCEL PERE ET FILS BRUT 1959 ......... ee ee, 4.59 50.25

An astonishing Champagne opportunity. Made of selected grapes gathered during the great 1959 harvest. The wine is com-
pletely dry, surprisingly good and sensationally priced. Half bottles also available at $2.59 each, $54.75 the case of 24—
and Magnums at $9.59 each. $52.25 the case.

[55 AYALA GOLD LABEL BRUT 1959 .......... Oe ea 4.99 36.50

French Champagnes have slowly crept up in price during the last few years. Though our cost is higher, we pleasantly report
that during this period we offer this world-famous vintage Champagne well below the price you might normally pay for a
non-vintage. As a matter of fact, it will match in breed, dryness and flavor, many Champagnes that sell for over $8.00 the
bottle. Half bottles also available at $2.79 each, $60.00 the case of 24.

10> POMMERY &€ GRENO CUVEE MONACO BRUT .................. 5.99 68.50

Pommery & Greno is proud of their “Cuvee Monaco Brut” which carries above the label the flag of Monaco and a cameo
seal of Prince and Princess Rainier III. These treasured bottles, from the great Pommery cellars, contain some of the best
wine that this Champagne firm produces. Bone dry, in magnificent balance, it will please the most demanding Champagne
taste. If it sold for $8.00 the bottle, it would be well worth it—but at $5.99, it is a happy choice that should not be over-
looked for festive Fall entertaining.

31 FORTNUM & MASON ENGLISH MARKET BRUT 1955 ............ 6.99 76.50

The English take their Champagne seriously and insist that it be good and very, very dry. Here is one of London’s favorites,
selected for the fastidious palates of the Fortnum & Mason clientele. It is a magnificent 1955 and we were fortunate indeed
to be able to obtain 25 cases.

AMERICAN CHAMPAGNE...
97 $f. MICHEL BRUT (Finger Lakes, New York State) .............. 2.79 31.50

The American Champagnes produced in the Finger Lakes district of New York State generally command over $4.00 the
bottle. We will match this one, beautifully made and delightfully dry, with any of them, and at only $2.79. With the cost
as low as this, you can serve Champagne with the same carefree abandon generally reserved for Bourbon or Scotch.
