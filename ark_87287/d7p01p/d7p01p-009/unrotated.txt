 

HOW TO BUILD A “LIBRARY” OF WINE

CONTINUED FroM PAGE 233

“cellar.” But who has today? What
the modern house needs is a “li-
brary” of wine, a small, select, con-
stantly-replenished collection, from
which one can pick and choose, and
through which one can browse. To
the wine-lover, the labels on the
bottle have a romance of their own,
and the names roll over the tongue
with anticipatory pleasure: Haut
Brion, Lafite-Rothschild, Pinot Noir,
Montrachet — words of history,
glory, and taste.

What are the practical reasons
for building up your library of
wine? Well, to begin with, you
will have the eternal pleasure of
intelligently interpreting wine lists
and wine literature. And if you are
interested in the future generation,
you can, if you wish, gather a col-
lection of wines to leave your chil-
dren, who will toast your wisdom
in being so thoughtful. The custom
still prevails in England, where a
case or two of vintage port of the
newest year is often laid down at
the birth of a son.

Beyond these emotional reasons,
there is an economic justification.
If you buy wines when they are
young and allow them to reach
their full maturity, their value
often rises astronomically. A case
of Chateau Haut Brion 1959 was
worth $40 in January, 1960; in
January, 196] it was worth $60;
in January, 1962, it had reached
$85, and as the vintage becomes
rarer, it will rise even more. Many
older vintages are worth well over
$100 a case.

It is unlikely that you will want
to make a habit of investing in
wine for profit (although it can
sometimes be more secure than the
Stock Market as an investment).
But you can, at any rate, use this
as an argument for doing some-
thing which is pleasant and reward-
ing for its own sake, if you are
accused of succumbing to luxury.

In any case, by investing $100
in a library of wine, you will have
the following advantages:

1. No need to call your wine

merchant at the last minute to ac-
quire a bottle or two, chosen in
haste and at random, for a dinner
party.

2. Your wine will come to the
table after a comfortable rest in
your home and not shaken en route
from your neighborhood shop.

3. And you will have the privi-
lege of making a leisurely choice,
in your own home, to suit your
mood and your menu.

We live in an age of increasing
leisure, and the intellectual pur-
suit of knowledge should be one
of our aims. Wine is a part of the
educated person’s knowledge. It
has its own geography, for there
are vineyards all over the world,
and each one is different. Many a
wine collector has been moved to
pursue the wine trail in_ literal
fashion and can often be seen en-
thusiastically knocking at the doors
of a chateau in Bordeaux, a wine
grower in California, and a vign-
eron in Beaujolais or on_ the
Moselle.

The wine grape also has its own
rich history. It was formerly the
greatest of all commerces after the
fabulous spice trade. The trading
galleys of the ancient world, that
are occasionally found sunk in the
Mediterranean, are nearly always
ballasted with amphorae of wine.
The wealth of ancient France was
built on her export to England of
Bordeaux wines, and when that
supply was cut off, the English
turned to Port wine and thus built
up the commerce and wealth of
Portugal and created an alliance of
trade and friendship that survives
today. If you build up your library
of wine you will soon want to build
up a library about wine, for its his-
tory is fascinating.

What is more, it will amplify
your own personal relationships.
There is the constant challenge of
experience, of comparing with your
friends “Bottle A” against “Bottle
B” and of describing its taste and

its unique qualities. And, of course,

literature is full of references to

   

wine—Plato, Johnson, Thackeray,
Byron, Shakespeare. The list is
almost endless.

You don’t need to know much
to care for wine, but you should
remember that wine is a_ living
thing. It is alive in the bottle, un-
like distilled liquors, such as Bour-
bon, Gin, and Scotch. Its person-
ality chanyes as it ages in your
home. It ripens and develops and
improves.

Perhaps the most potent force in
preventing the widespread drinking

‘

of wine is “wine snobbery.” This,
more than anything else, drives
people to beer and Coca-Cola. You
don’t have to be “educated” to ap-
preciate wine. The possession of a
“library” of wine, however modest,
will arm you against intimidation
of wine snobs, who may talk much
and know little. Many people don't
serve wine simply because they’re
afraid of making a mistake and
seeming to be unsophisticated.
Never fear. Most of the wine shib-
boleths are nonsense and can be
ignored with propriety.

First and foremost, do not let
the wine experts tell you what you
should drink. Can music critics
persuade you to listen to Beethoven
when you prefer Tchaikovsky? Or
does the art critic manage to make
you an admirer of Paul Klee when
vou prefer Rembrandt? Develop a
taste of your own and confidence
in it. Red wine is usually taken
with meat, yes, and white wine with
fish. But perfectly respectable peo-
ple like to drink white wine with
meat, and there’s no reason why
you shouldn’t, if that is what you
like. Try it both ways, get the ex-
perience of learning for yourself
and, if you make mistakes, don’t
worry. The important thing to re-
member is that wine is not a ritual
ceremony but a pleasure.

Now here are my suggestions for
three different libraries of wine
that you can collect for $100, $250,
or $500.
