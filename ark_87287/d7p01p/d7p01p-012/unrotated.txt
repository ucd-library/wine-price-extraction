The melodic rhythms of John
Milton’s prose are not one whit
diminished, whether the book is
stored under the bed or on the most
beautifully carved bookshelves, and
so it is with wine. The noblest of
table wines can be stored in car-
tons, original wooden cases, on do-
it-yourself wooden shelves, be they
rectangular, octagonal, lozenge-
shaped, or diamond-shaped. Others,
who have a strong sense of decora-
tion, may buy elaborate wine racks
that have now become the vogue or
hire the best cabinetmaker in the
area. This is a personal decision
that has very little to do with how
the wine tastes or its future.

However, it is important, no mat-
ter how the wine is stored, that it
not be put next to a roaring furnace
where the temperature will soar
above 80° F., or in an exposed
area, where the winter winds may
bring frost. And it is also import-
ant that the wines rest on their
sides, or at a slight angle to permit
the liquid to keep the cork moist.

The penalty for standing table
wine upright is severe. The cork
dries, the air then gets in, the wine
then becomes oxidized and gradu-
ally becomes vinegar. This is not
true of Sherry or Port because
these wines are fortified by Brandy
against further fermentation and
they can stand as erect as a soldier
without suffering harm.

If I have failed to persuade you
thus far to acquire at least a
modest collection of wines under

the roof of your own home, I can

only make this last appeal to your
sense of enlightened self-interest
by quoting my very good friend and
fellow wine lover, Clifton Fadiman:
“[ heard once that the palate is
among the last of our organs to de-
cay ... yes, our muscles give way
at last to gravity’s quiet resistless
pull; the best, the most joyful of
our glands in the end withers: the
limbs begin to ask, “What’s the

   

hurry?” but I know men of eighty
whose infirmities for the brief space
of a bottle’s emptying vanish as
they sip their wine, their taste buds
is lively as when they were one-and-
twenty—nay, livelier. The pleasures
of old age are few, but what is more
worthy of cultivation than a pleas-
ure that the body, even in decay,
is still able to enjoy without enfee-

blement

FIVE “RULES” TO IGNORE

people are not, of course, talking
about such extremes of age, but the
lure of age has caused many an
Englishman to consume his _pre-
cious Montrachet when the fruit has
gone, and the wine has passed its
prime. Don’t let your wines stand
too long. The length of aging varies
from wine to wine, and the bottles
of your library should be drunk at
their peak. Let them rest while
young, drink them in middle age,
and don’t let them get old. As for
age, think of wine as women. Good
in their youth, wonderful in their
maturity.

3. All red wines should be decant-
ed. This is simple ceremony,. re-
quiring only a bright light, a de-
canter, and some patience on your
part. No special knowledge is re-
quired. However, there is no need
to decant a white or red wine less
than ten years old—and rarely
white wine. The object of the ex-
ercise is to avoid the dregs and
sediment in the bottom of the bot-
tle, and you can do this by pouring
carefully, and by leaving the last
half inch as an offering to the gods.

If the wine ts really old, then by
all means let it stand upright for
several hours, then decant to savor
its full measure of pleasure.

4. A vintage chart is gospel. A
vintage chart is a guide, nothing
more. Don’t take it too literally.
Try and avoid ordering a bad wine
of a great year instead of a good
wine of an average year. Bad wines
are bad, as a rule, whatever the
year. And good wines are simply
less good or better, according to
year. Use your own taste, not the
chart’s—rather like seeing a good
film even though it received only
three stars from the local critic.
dS. Each wine requires a different
glass. Decorative, but not neces-
sary. Basically, a simple wine glass
can be used for any wine, provided
it is colorless (so that you can
enjoy the wine’s color), tulip-
shaped (so that you can experience
more conveniently the wine’s fra-
grance), and generous in_ size,
since the glass should never be
more than two-thirds full to extract
the maximum impact of sensory
pleasure.

The Recent Vintages

Since this article has been written, the information that
appears above can be brought more up-to-date by includ-
ing as possibilities such recent vintages as 1960 in Red
Bordeaux, and 1961 in Red Bordeaux, White Bordeaux,
Red Burgundy and White Burgundy. Also consider the
1962 vintages which are now available in the United States
from such areas as Beaujolais, Pouilly Fuisse and Country

Wines.
