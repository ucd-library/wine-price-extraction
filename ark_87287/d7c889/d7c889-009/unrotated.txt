1149 WISDOM’S FINO PALMA ........------seerrr ttt 1.99 1.09 17.95
A magnificent example of bone dry, pale, straw colored Sherry. This classic ‘Fino Palma’ has helped Wisdom &
Warter achieve its great international reputation, now over a century old. An ideal aperitif when served slightly
chilled.

1151 WISDOM’S ROYAL BROWN OLOROSO 4. cS ee ee 2.19 1.49 19.95

There are few wines produced in the world that quite achieve the rich, deep flavor, or dark color depth of a fine
Brown Sherry. Here is a typical, fully aged example.

1148 WISDOM’S AMONTILLADO VINO 6 6 a 2.49 1.99 22 .6>
As this name implies, a good Amontillado belongs to the Fino family, but they acquire certain different character-
istics as they mature; the color becomes more amber-like. As in the Finos, they are very dry, more nutty in flavor

and develop greater body.
1150 WISDOM’S GOLDEN CUR ANE ee ee ee 2.99 2.49 27D

Generally speaking, a top-flight Cream Sherry such as this is the oldest and most luxurious of the wines found in
the Bodegas of Jerez. Usually, a fine Cream Sherry of a reputable firm commands $5.00 or more the bottle. It is no
ordinary event to obtain this medium dry, dramatically rich wine for only $2.49. We urge you to try it.

1154 BRIGGS 1914 CREAM MUN A os ee es ee ee ee ee ee 4.99 4.59 A957
Amazing value! —particularly when you consider the fact that Cream Sherries that lack this age and distinction
command a higher price than this in the open market. Quantity limited. Cask laid down in 1914 and periodically
refreshed with younger, aged wines, consistent with the Spanish Solera system of aging sherries.

RARE OLD VINTAGE SOLERA MADEIRA ON SALE

1253 1748 VERDELHO SOLERA MADEIRA .......--:+sssseereees 29.75 24.795 2230.00

The entire contents of the 1748 cask were recently bottled, interrupting a 225 year slumber. It consisted only of
700 bottles, some of which has found its way to Sherrys. Our tasting notes read “Amazing vigor, penetrating
bouquet, great depth of flavor, relatively dry—rivals old Cognac in scope and interest.” Because precious few bottles
exist in the world, we suggest prompt acquisition—even a single bottle will add its touch of lustre to the most

distinguished cellar, and historic interest to any dinner party.
