command over $4.00 the bottle. We will match this one, beautifully made and delightfully dry,

If you do not insist that your French sparkling wine needs the appellation “Champagne,” here
is the wine you should drink. They learned their trade in the Champagne district, carried their
craft to the French Alps, grew the excellent local grape varieties and proceeded to make a dry
French sparkling wine that your friends and you will really enjoy. It is dry, of delicacy and
finesse and eminently satisfying.

reservedly for those who want to experience the best among our native products.

We have just returned from Europe and we saw this wine listed everywhere we went in Paris

compete with Champagnes that command over $10.

sfe0 BOLLINGER BRUT (19 07 Imperial). og ne ee ee et 6.35 68.58
Bollinger has learned that often a large bottle is too much, and a half bottle not quite enough.
So they devised an ideal size for two—the 19 ounce bottle—only 7 oz. less than the regular bottle.
It costs no more an ounce. We urge that you try it for its practicality and convenience. This size
has been an outstanding success in London for over a year. The wine is outstandingly fine. Also
available in the BOLLINGER BRUT 1961 Vintage at $7.80 the Imperial; $84.24 the case.
