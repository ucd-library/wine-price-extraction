1964 RED BORDEAUX ( Continued)

The 1962 vintage has never
like a Cinderella tale, they have something important to offer the wine drink
relatively early maturing, they are absolutely delightful for present drinking with at least five good years
ahead. Their cost has gone up substantially in Bordeaux during the recent months as the ’59s and ’61s
become scarcer and more expensive.
