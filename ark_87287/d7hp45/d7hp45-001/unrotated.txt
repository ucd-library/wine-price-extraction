FAIR-TRADE PRICES

To the best of our knowledge these prices are the minimum
at which these Wines and/or Spirits may be sold in the
State of New York (Rule 26, New York State Law) as
published in the last official listings, errors and omissions
excepted.

 

Since the repeal of Prohibition in 1933, the firm of
M. Lehmann, Inc., has taken the lead, in offering to
prospective buyers, wines and spirits of the highest
quality at sensible prices. This lead never has nor
ever will be relinquished. It will always be our
policy to give the consumer the benefit of our judi-
cious buying and we realize it is our responsibility
to supply only the best.

This catalogue lists an extensive and important
selection of wines and spirits, as reliable as they are
distinguished. Chosen carefully, the wines herein
represent the fruit of our tireless and conscientious
search on behalf of our many clients. We offer
them with confidence in their authenticity and
quality.

An experienced staff is ready to advise and assist
you in every possible way.

The test of any wine merchant will ever reside in
the wine he sells and we cordially invite you to put

us to this test.
