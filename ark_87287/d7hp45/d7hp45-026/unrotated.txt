CHATEAU MOUTON ROTHSCHILD 1973 (Pauillac) ees 136,25
We have an intriguing story to tell. We all know that it has been

a practice of Baron Philippe de Rothschild to persuade the world's

greatest artists to creat a label for each of his vintage meee
years. We have seen the works of Chagall in 1970, ICO i Lounage a 6
Miro in 1969, Braque in 1965. The only one missing
was Pablo Picasso. World opinion developed quickly
that Baron Philippe was never able to persuade Picasso.
The truth is that Picasso did create a label for the good
Baron but asked that it not be used until after his death, |

   

Picasso died in 1973 - the very year Chateau Mouton lenie. Fi
Rothschild was officially declared a First Growth - the :
first change in the 1855 classification in over a century.
To commemorate the event, and the memory of Picasso, eh yore
Baron Rothschild declared his art the official label for {27F ee
the 1973 vintage, a very good year at Mouton Rothschild. ’ ah

CUISINE MINCEUR, written by Michel Guerard, is currently the #1 best seller in the world of food.

CHAMPAGNE CUVEE MICHEL GUERARD BRUT promises to be a best seller in the world of wine.

 

WHY? ‘Michel Guerard! to quote Craig Claiborne, 'is one of the world's greatest chefs.' It is this
handsome, youthful French chef who has created 'la cuisine minceur', or slimming cookery. It was
out of his expertise in catering to the food enthusiasts of the world at Pot au Feu, the spa resort in
Eugenie-les-Bains, and at Regine's in Paris and in New York, that his best seller 'Cuisine Minceur'
was born.

 

Just as Michel Guerard revered lightness,
beauty and flavor in food preparation, he
POs sought out the same virtues in French Cham-

CHAMPAGNE pagne. He ultimately found what he was

looking for in the town of Mesnil in the
“i Champagne district, where a superb light,
miche
Psavoya¥

very dry and elegant Champagne was produced
MESNIL-SUR-OGER

exclusively from white grapes. Proud of what
he discovered, he had this noble wine bear
the simple name of BRUT CHAMPAGNE
i MICHEL GUERARD, It is featured at Regine's
wg eens in Paris and Eugenie-les-Bains. It will soon
be available at Regine's in New York, the
Four Seasons, and Windows on the World.

We recommend it unreservedly, and candidly, we think it is in league with other Champagnes that
command double the price. Our first shipment will be available for delivery in early March; We
suggest you order it now to make certain that you can experience its bone-dry, Tight, sparkling

elegance.

$8.99 the bottle, $97.09 the case ......

discover that Givry will prove lighter to

early consumption. Alexis Lichine selected
this outstanding example - the best we have ever tasted from this area.

some of the best soil of the Cote d'Or is no ex-

Clos de Vougeot, the largest vineyard of Burgundy, consists of 125 acres
