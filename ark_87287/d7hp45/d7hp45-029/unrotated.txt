CHRISTIAN BROS. is a Catholic teaching order founded

in 1680 in the Champagne district of France. The proceeds
of their wine- making helps support nearly 200 schools and
colleges, including Manhattan College in New York City.
They own over 1500 acres in the Napa Valley. Brother
Timothy has been a cellar-master since 1940 and he does
not believe in vintaging wines - he prefers achieving a
balanced harmony comprising two or more vintages. Thus,
vintage years do not appear on his labels. The target of
the Christian Bros. is that their wines be ready for drinking

when they reach the dinner table. Some exceptional wines and great values can
be found in these cellars. We suggest you try them.

CLOS DU VAL is referred to as ‘Bordeaux in Napa. The

wine-maker - who we found knowledgeable and charming
~ is Bernard Portet (the son of the manager of Chateau
Lafite Rothschild) who 'went west' to grow wine that would
approximate the characteristics of the Medoc. Unlike
many of his neighbors, he does not strive for power, but
for balanced delicacy .

CUVAISON is a small, fine winery, principally owned by

Oakleigh Thorne, one of New York's most knowledgeable
wine lovers. There is a brilliant future for the wine because
the wine- maker is Philip Togni who studied in France and
put in long tutelage at Chateau Lascombes in Bordeaux.

FREEMARK ABBEY'S PINOT CHARDONNAY 1973 was

the one that won the First Award at a New York blind
tasting against twenty Chardonnay rivals from Burgundy
and California. It is the classic by which all other dry
white wines of California are generally judged. They
also reach high points of excellence with their Johannis-
berg Riesling and Cabernet Sauvignon.

HEITZ CELLAR'S houses one of the most idealistic of
wine-makers - Joe Heitz. His wines are the most
sought-after, hard-to-come-by, and most expensive
of the Napa Valley. Our supply is small, and we offer
them optimistically in the hope that they will not all
be gone within days of the mailing of the brochure.

ROBERT MONDAVI'S CABERNET SAUVIGNON

is often served at the White House and at dinners

given by the State Department. If a Lafite Roth-

: | schild is to be born in Napa Valley, we suspect it

ck will take place at the Mondavi Winery. The winery
sicowon 195 ay vor is a work of beauty well worth visiting - the dedi-

cation of Robert Monadvi and his sons and daughter

to making the best wines of the valley, is a delight

to behold. Their friendliness as hosts make them well worth visiting.

MOUNT VEEDER WINERY is a tiny eagle's nest of a vineyard
high atop the Mayacamas Mountains, dramatically situated on
an extinct volcano called Mount Veeder. To a California
wine-lover, Michael Bernstein's vineyard proves to be as
exciting a place to visit as Romanee-Conti is to a Burgundy
lover. His Cabernet and Chardonnay are not just good - but

JOSEPH PHELPS! vineyards are perhaps the most impressive

of the valley. Joe Phelps is a Colorado builder who used

wood to great effect - including pavilions, a closed railroad
bridge, and beautiful upright oak tanks. Walter Schug, the
German wine-maker, is producing some of the best Johannisberg
Riesling we have ever tasted, with a promise of a remarkable
equivalent to Beerenauslese and Trockenbeerenauslese. Not
many bottles were produced, so we suggest reserving now to be
one of the lucky ones. Should reach us by May/June.

post at the University of Chicago to tackle the challenge of being a wine- maker.
He has succeeded. Due in April.

STERLING
VINEYARDS

STERLING VINEYARDS is a sun-washed white fortress in

the style of a Greek monastery, perched on a ridge high

over northern Napa Valley. It is reached by an aerial
tramway. We have tasted many of their wines and some

are already proving astonishing. They are outstanding in

reds - and you will like their Zinfandel, Cabernet Sauvignon
1972, and the prize-winning Merlot 1973. Their Chardonnay
is truly superb.
