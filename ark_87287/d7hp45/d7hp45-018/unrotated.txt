Our experience has taug sht us that it is futile to forecast the tastes of
Scotch whisky drinkers, there are as many tastes as there are brands,
y solution for the merchant is to carry as many of the
leading, recognized brands as he conveniently can. This we have
attempted to do, and if your favorite brand is not listed, we are pre-
pared to secure it for you at the shortest possible notice. There are
several straight whiskies listed as well as all the usual blends. Par-
ticularly noteworthy are the all malt Scotches—-Smith’s Glenlivet,
Berry Bros. Superb Liquer and Glen Graeme.
