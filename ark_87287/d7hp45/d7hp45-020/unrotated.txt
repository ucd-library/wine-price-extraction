M. LEHMANN, In « Rh OP ARK AVERY
ie, a

Cognac is the name of the finest of all brandy, and is distilled from
a wine which is made of grapes grown within the legally defined
district of France from whence it derives its name. No other brandy
can authentically be called Cognac. It is from the Charente or “inner
circle’ of Cognac, which is again divided into districts, that the
choicest brandies are produced. Named in their order of quality,
they are Grande C hampagne, Petite Champagne, Borderies and Fins
Bois. Should the name “Champagne”, as used in connection with
brandy be confusing, Cognac historians point out that this term is
merely obtained from the ancient name of the district, which was
once called La Champagne.

The brandies listed in this catalogue were selected from among
the acknowledged leaders.
