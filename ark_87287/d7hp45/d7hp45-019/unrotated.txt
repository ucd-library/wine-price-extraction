Much has been written about whiskey but it 1s always interesting to
know that this popular distillation was unknown in America during
early Colonial days. Mention of the word “whiskey” was not re-
corded until the Revolution and prior to that our ancestors drank
rum which was made in New England. It is controversial whether
the whiskey referred to had been brought from England by traders,
or distilled here with the “know how” of Scotch and Irish settlers.

BONDED—a guarantee that the whiskey is straight, is aged for a
minimum of four years, bottled at 100 proof and has been aged,
stored and bottled under Government supervision and in strict con-
formance with Government regulations. Pure alcohol is 200 proof,
therefore, bonded whiskies are half alcohol by volume. (Based on a
temperature of 60 degrees Fahrenheit. )

STRAIGHT—any type whiskey made from a fermented mash of
grain containing not less than 51% of rye, corn, etc., and which has
been distilled at not more than 160 proof. It must be aged for at
least two years in new charred oak casks and cannot contain or be

blended with neutral spirits.

BLEND OF STRAIGHTS—these are merely what the term implies
two or more straight whiskies, of either the same or various ages,
blended together according to various formulas.

SPIRIT BLEND—a minimum of 20% straight whiskey by volume
blended with neutral spirits, preferably grain, that have been dis-
tilled to 190 proof making them almost tasteless, colorless or
“neutral” in character.
