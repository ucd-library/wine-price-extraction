WHAT IS CARRUADES DE CHATEAU
LAFITE-ROTHSCHILD?

At Chateau Lafite-Rothschild, the world’s greatest red wine
vineyard, they follow the practice of labeling the wines grown
from vines older than twelve years—CHATEAU LAFITE-
ROTHSCHILD. Those wines grown from younger vines are
labeled — CARRUADES DE CHATEAU LAFITE-ROTHS-

CHILD. The grape varieties, soil and viniculture are identical.

In blind tastings it is difficult to distinguish between the two.
The differentiating characteristics are that the Carruades is a
bit lighter and matures somewhat more quickly. No matter
which label is on the bottle, you will surely be experiencing
one of the greatest red wines of the world. NONTILLA
We quote Cyril Ray from his book, Lafite: “The Carruades
is made from the same grapes as the Lafite itself, in the same
proportions, grown in the same vignoble, made by the same
men, in the same way, and under the same roof. Like Lafite,
it is entitled to the appellation ‘Pauillac.’ The only difference
between the Carruades and Lafite is that the Carruades is
made only from those vines on the property that are not yet
twelve years old, the Lafite from twelve-year-olds and older.”
1967 was the last vintage at Lafite that was bottled under the
Carruades label. Those listed here are therefore collector’s
items. They are available in limited quantity and are irre-
placeable. The wines are truly superb and bear all the rich-
ness, complexity and distinction of a wine grown and chateau-
bottled at Lafite-Rothschild. Order now,

THE VINEYARDS OF NAPA, SONOMA, AND MENDOCINO VALLEYS

Our associates, Sam and Michael Aaron, spent the second half of January joyously exploring the great
vineyards of Napa, Sonoma and Mendocino Valleys. They were delighted with many of their wine
discoveries - some of the more exalted California wines achieving a rank of great distinction. However,
like all good things in life, these truly great wines are produced in limited quantity - few reach New
York. When they do, the quantity is so small that they must be rationed. Don't let this discourage you.

We are limiting this report to Napa, Sonoma and Mendocino - the areas we have just visited. We will

report on our coming visits to the vineyards south and east of San Francisco in a later brochure.

THE NAPA VALLEY

We quote from the newly-issued book, THE CALIFORNIA WINE BOOK, by Bob
Thompson and Hugh Johnson, "The Napa Valley is the place in California, the
keeper of the flame, the pinnacle." Now let us proceed on a tour together of the

better vineyards of the Napa Valley.

BERINGER/LOS HERMANOS BROS.

The vineyard was founded by the Beringer Bros. in 1871 and
was acquired by Nestle in 1971. Out of its 2500 acres of
vine, the distinguished wine-maker Myron Nightingale has
produced some glories. In our opinion, under the name of
Los Hermanos, the Beringer Winery has made a great contri-
bution to those. who want to drink good red and white wine

from a handsome 50.7-0Z. magnum carafe.

Robert Balzer, wine editor of the Los Angeles Times Mirror, recently
conducted a tasting of California Gamay Beaujolais with a ten-man,
expert panel that included Burgess Meredith and Carroll O'Connor
(widely known as Archie Bunker). The comments read, "Los Hermanos
Gamay Beaujolais is the big winner! 18.3 points - or the highest score

at the tasting! The wine is 95% of the 1974 vintage, 5% of the 1975.
Fresh, light, gay, fruity and soft." The 50.7-oz. carafe is equal to

two regular bottles, which means that the cost per fifth comes out to

less than $1.90. Possibly the best red wine buy in town. Like Beaujolais,

serve slightly chilled.

CHENIN BLANC
A clean, medium dry, all purpose white wine that can be served day in
and day out, without making too much of a dent in the family budget.

CHARDONNAY
The varietal flavor of the Chardonnay comes through loud and clear in
this well-made dry white wine.

BEAULIEU VINEYARDS, with its classic gardens, resembles a
wine chateau in the Medoc, so it is not too surprising to learn
that the finest Beaulieu bottles are of the greatest Bordeaux
wine grape - the Cabernet Sauvignon. First among these giants
are the 'Private Reserve’ Cabernets - regal, rare and rationed.
Only three bottles to a customer while our stock holds out.
However, don't overlook the other excellent Beaulieu Cabernets
which are listed below and are available in somewhat larger

supply.

CHAPELLET WINERY is a genuine wine-growing estate that
features Johannisberg Riesling and Cabernet Sauvignon
supplemented by excellent Chardonnay and Chenin Blanc.
The vineyard is at a high altitude, remote from neighbors.
Don Chappellet left a prosperous Los Angeles business to
live the challenging life of a wine grower. He and his
family live a rich life and produce superb wines.
