Editor’s Note: Chateau Lafite Roths-
child 1948 is one of the greatest sur-
prises that ever befell the Bordeaux wine
experts. It was squeezed between the
highly publicized 1947 and 1949 vin-
tages and therefore was ignored during
its early days. Because of its richness in
tannin, like the ugly duckling, it blos-
somed into beautiful maturity which
only became apparent recently. Can-
didly, in a comparative price tasting, it
surpassed the Lafite Rothschild 1947
which commands five times the price.
The cost is extraordinary for a wine that
has spent two decades in the bottle and
from one of the great red wine vineyards
of Bordeaux - — only $13.75 the bottle,
$148.50 the case. As a suitable and
equally deep-flavored alternative, we
turn to the rich wines of Pomerol and
recommend with enthusiasm the Cha-
teau Rouget 1964 at $3.79 the bottle.
$40.95 the case.

 

‘At this point the dinner deserves a
pause, some pleasant relaxed conversa-
tion while we await the dessert. I do not
think you should attempt to make your
own Buche de Noel unless you are highls
skilled. It would be much simpler to call
Bloomingdale’s or your favorite French
Bakery in advance and have him pre-
pare one for you which you will pick up
the day before the dinner. Mr. Gumpert,
the food buyer of Bloomingdale’s as-
sures me that theirs are excellent and
compares favorably with those made in
Paris. Something cool and light will be
required now. My favorite. whether it
be for Christmas or the year round. is a
Champagne Sherbet. It is simple to

ike—anyone can do it yrovided you

1 freezer or an electric mixer with
1 freezer attachment. Actually. it can be
ade in the freezer trays of the refriger-
r. Directions are given below.

“Tf the glamor of the dinner is to be
maintained at this point, we know of
nothing better to serve than the greatest
of Champagnes—Dom Ruinart Blanc de
Blancs 1961—in the dramatic and festive
18th Century handsome bottle. After all.
remember, we are not compromising.”

Editor’s Note: Only 1,300 cases of
this remarkable Blanc de Blanes reached
the United States in 1969. There are
those whose claim this Cuvee makes a
serious bid to being considered the best
single champagne produced in France
and we are not inclined to disagree too
strongly. In any event, it is capable of
providing the fitting climax climax to
your Christmas dinner (15.79 the bottle,
170.53 case). As a less expensive alter-
native, you might consider the Blanc de
Blancs from one of the oldest cham-
pagne houses in France—the St. Mar-
ceaux Blanc de Blancs 1962—it is well
worth $10.00 the bottle but your cost
would be only $7.49 the bottle, $80.90
the case.

“And now we come to the slow, pleas-
ant climax, when the nuts and fruits are
put on the table, the cigars are brought
forth, and the greatest Cognac that one
can find is served with hot, strong coffee.
[ know of no Cognac that compares with
the Hine Family Reserve which is the
proud creation of the Hine family who
have been important in the Cognac
country since the 18th Century. Most of
this Cognac is from stocks that date back
to the early 19th Century, refreshed with
some younger brandy. Each bottle is
numbered and hand-signed by Mr. Hine
himself. Only 25 cases were shipped to
the United States in an entire year, for
the Hines hate to part with it—and I
blame them not.”

Editor’s Note: The Hine Family Re-
serve Cognac is the greatest single Co-
Pnac we haa € CVET offered. As a possible
alternative, you might consider the
Single Cask l nbhlended Cognac.

DOUBLE TURKEY CONSOMME

The time from start to finish is rela-
tively long, but very little attention is re-
quired during the process. In any event,
even if there were more trouble in the
preparing, the results would be worth the
effort.

Purchase about 4 pounds of turkey
parts from a good market. I usually buy 2
pounds gizzards and 2 pounds necks and
backs or sometimes just the back section.
Place in an 8 or 10 quart pot with water
to cover, with an inch or so above. Bring
to a boil rapidly and skim off any scum
which rises to the surface during the first
ten minutes of boiling. Reduce the heat
to simmer and cover the pot and let it
simmer for 6 to 8 hours very, very slowly,
with what the French sometimes refer to
as a feeble ebullition.

When it has cooked thoroughly, strain
into a large bowl and discard the meat and
bones—allow to cool. Cover and place in
the refrigerator for 24 to 36 hours. Pur-
chase 2 turkey legs and thighs or two or
three legs. Carefully skim the fat from the
broth and place the new meat in the pot
with the broth. Bring to a boil and skim
off any scum. Cover and reduce the heat
to simmer and simmer for 5 to 6 hours.
Allow to cool and strain into a large bowl.
Discard the meat. Chill in the refrigerator
for several hours, or overnight. Remove
fat carefully and taste the jelly, for that is
what you will have by that time, for the
proper proportion of salt. It should need
no other seasoning—for the true essence
of turkey is enough. Add salt to a pot and
add the jelly and heat over medium heat.
Bring to a boil and boil rapidly for 30
minutes. Cool to lukewarm, or cold. Beat
3 or four egg whites lightly and put into
the broth, returning it to the fire. Heat to
boiling, whisking with a metal whisk till
the broth comes through the oil and the
egg white rises to the surface. Strain the
broth through a linen towel or several
thicknesses of cheese cloth and it is now
ready for serving. You will have about 12

cups of double consommé.
