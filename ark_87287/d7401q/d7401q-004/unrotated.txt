AX CHATEAU MOUTON D’‘ARMAILHACQ 1942 (Pauillac) $06. *1.48.. 11.69

This 1942 Claret which towers head and shoulders above the regional red wines of Bordeaux is now
fully matured and a delight for present day drinking.

 
       
  
 

 
 

*CHATEAU DUCRU BEAUCAILLOU 1943 (St. Julien)

One of the biggest and stoutest of the 1943’s—Perhaps even bigger than a Lafite of the same year. A
magnificent wine that will continue to improve with the years.

 
   
  
 

 
 

*CHATEAU LYNCH BAGES 1943 (Pauillac)
Considered one of the best vineyards of the Medoc. In a great vintage year, such as 1943, it is rich, fine,
full, with a distinguished after-taste. An irresistible opportunity for those who want truly great Claret at
modest cost.

 
   
   
  
 

 
  

*CHATEAU MOUTON D/ARMAILHACQ 1943 (Pauillac) 286 1.59 18.65

This Chateau is adjacent to Mouton Rothschild and is also the property of the Rothschild family. Delicate,
polished and aristocratic, it is a beautiful wine to drink today.

 
   
  
 

   

*CHATEAU RAUZAN-GASSIES 1937 (Margaux) 413° 2.19: 23.95

By and large, the 1937 Clarets are the hardest to obtain and the most sought after. This one 1s just
coming into its own and demonstrates its true greatness when served today. In our opinion, this is a
Letter bottle of wine for immediate drinking than a Latour or Lafite of more recent vintage even though

the latter may sell for three times the price.

 
     
    
    
 

   

   

*CHATEAU LEOVILLE LASCASES 1937 (st. Julien) 451 2.39 25.95
No longer commercially available, this magnificent 1937 was one of the most successful wines produced
during this extremely great vintage. Now over a decade in the bottle, it has acquired great mellowness
and charm.

G CHATEAU RIEUSSEC 1942 (Sauternes) aie 21.87 22487

The 1942 vintage proved more successful in Sauternes than in any other wine growing district in France.
It possesses all the richness, lusciousness and finesse associated with great Sauternes.

HW LES ECHEZEAUX 1947 419 3.49 39.75

Estate-Bottled, Domaine de la Romanee Conti
The wines of the ‘Domaine de la Romanee Conti,’ because of their scarcity and magnificence, have
always been collectors’ items among serious wine drinkers. This one was produced at the ‘Echezeaux’
vineyard during the great 1947 vintage. Though superb for immediate drinking, it will achieve even
greater heights after it has matured further in your cellars.

J PULIGNY MONTRACHET, PUCELLES, 1946 70. 1.6): 19.26

Estate-Bottled, Domaine Leflaive
The ‘Pucelles’ vineyard is outstanding in the commune of Puligny-Montrachet. The 1946 vintage pro-
duced many excellent white Burgundies that were well above average. This thoroughbred wine demon-
strates the validity of this statement in a most impressive manner.

     
 
      
   
   
     
   
   
     
    
     
 
 
     

*These five wines were carefully aged in the cellars of Bellows & Co. We were fortunate to have
been able to acquire these distinctive Clarets from Henri Wines, Ltd. in time to add pleasure
to your Fall and Winter entertaining.
