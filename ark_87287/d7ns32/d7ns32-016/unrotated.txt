Remarkably fine example of French Armagnac Brandy
in Antique Glass Decanter. The bottle is giant size with
a solid glass center around which the Brandy flows.
A most intriguing bottle that is now being featured in
curio shops of Paris.

Messrs. Hine have used their oldest reserve Cognac

The man will be poetic about the Cognac, the woman
will be eternally grateful for the beautiful Decanter.
