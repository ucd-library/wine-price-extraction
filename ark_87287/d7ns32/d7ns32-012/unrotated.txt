FIRST SHOWING! The perfectly prepared Extra Dry
Martini of Heublein that can be served proudly di-
rectly from the bottle, a beautifully designed Pitcher
Decanter. It is sufficiently handsome to be a conver-
sation piece, and yet it costs no more than the ordinary
bottle. Long after its contents have pleased the Martini
drinker, it still remains as a useful, graceful, Cocktail
Shaker and Water Pitcher. Nor do devotees of the
“Manhattan” need feel disconsolate, for this cocktail
can also be obtained in the beaker at the same price.
