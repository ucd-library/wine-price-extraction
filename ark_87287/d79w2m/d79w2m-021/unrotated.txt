BLANC DE BLANCS 1961
makes a serious bid at being
considered the best single
Champagne coming out of
France. Quantity limited.

15.48 the bottle— 167.19 the
Case.

America’s historic Bourbon is the
claim of VIRGINIA GENTLEMAN, bottled
only in full quarts.

 

Every once
in a while a star sud-
denly appears in the
galaxy of Cham-
pagne. This year a
great discoveryis
CHARLES HEID-
SIECK ROYAL BRUT
1959. Wine tasters
are amazed by its ex-
cellence. Very few
cases have been ship-
ped to America. It
cost 11.95 the bottle,
129.06 the case.

PERNOD~—as
French as ‘Boeuf Bour-
guignonne’, Montmartre,
and the Bal Musette —
will please your Franco-
phile friends.

American history
seems to indicate that our
cabinet members favor Ken-
tucky Bourbon. In England,
since 1667, kings and prime
ministers have preferred
Scotch whisky, and it has
often been HEDGES @&
BUTLER Royal. It rules with
a light hand, authoritative
but not despotic.

 

 

Scotland has sent
us their Scotch liqueur and
now Canada sends us their
Canadian liqueur which uses
fine Canadian whiskey as a
base. It bears the name of
the man who is reputed to
have created it-GEORGE M.
TIDDY.

 

Our good
friend, Richard
Blum, president
of the company
which imports
PETER DAW-
SON reports an
extraordinary in-
crease in the
sale of this
whisky during
the last two
years. He aattri-
butes it to the
quality of the
whisky, careful
blending and
well-balanced
lightness.
