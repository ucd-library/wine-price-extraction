ok Baron Philippe de ‘Rothschild

The great wine tradition of Chateau Mouton Rothschild
was recognized even during the early 15th Century
when it was the property of the Duke of Gloucester.
The careful cultivation of the vine and care in the cellar
was further enhanced when Baron Nathaniel de Roth-
schild, great-grandfather of the present owner, acquired
the vineyard in 1853. It has remained in the hands of
the Rothschild family since then, and came under the
personal supervision of Baron Philippe de Rothschild
in 1923. Chateau Mouton Rothschild has long com-
manded one of the highest prices on the Bordeaux
market. Its vineyards are planted 95% Cabernet Sau-
vignon, the grape variety which is most expensive to
cultivate in Bordeaux because of its low yield. How-
ever, these vines produce a rich wine and a long-lived
one. The longevity of the wine can be testified by the
fact that even its 1918 vintage, which we recently drank
with Clifton Fadiman at the Lutece Restaurant, tasted

a few more years of development ahead of it.
Immediately adjacent to Chateau Mouton Rothschild is
the property of Chateau Mouton Baron Philippe (for-
merly Chateau Mouton d’Armilhacq). Despite its prox-
imity to Chateau Mouton Rothschild, its soil is some-
what different. The result is that Chateau Mouton Baron
Philippe is a bit lighter, but of outstanding Pauillac
character and of unique distinction.

Since the yield of the two vineyards that Baron Phi-
lippe owns are relatively small and not equal to the
world demand, he developed the idea of creating an
exclusive mark—‘Mouton Cadet’. The purpose was to
offer the appreciative wine drinking public his own per-
sonal selection of the good wines of Bordeaux—wines
that he believed in, above average quality, and wines
that could be produced in sufficient quantity to satisfy
an ever-increasing world demand.
