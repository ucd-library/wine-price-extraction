1966 Estate-Botitled

RED BURGUNDIES

“Five thousand dollars invested in wine t
interest rates—the intangible dividends c
but are equally real”.

The above is a quote from the current December issue of TOWN &
COUNTRY Magazine. (We recommend that the wine lover stroll to the
nearest newstand and get his copy of December’s TOWN & COUNTRY
—in it you will find an informative, entertaining article describing “How
to Lay Down A Wine Cellar’—it talks not only about the more mature
vintages that are ready for drinking, but also how to wisely acquire, and
from what areas, such current years as 1966 and 1967.)

If this quotation has any validity, we know of no vintage in recent years
to justify investment more than the classic, truly great year of 1966 in
Burgundy. ’66 has all of the earmarks of longevity, exhibiting great
fragrance, fruit, sufficient tannin and superb balance. The wisdom of ac-
quiring 1966 red Burgundies is further testified to by the fact that the ’67s

his year will grow in value much faster than
annot be measured by any Dow-Jones index,

proved much too light and were lacking in balance and color—and the
early reports about the 1968 vintage indicate a dismal harvest. As we go
to press, we learn that the diminishing quantity of ’66s that remain in

Burgundian cellars have gone up on an average of 20% during the last
few months.

As wine drinkers, should you want to anticipate, by all means buy your
estate-bottled 1966 red Burgundy now while full selection is available
and the prices are still under reasonable control? And, as a further div-
idend in Burgundy, most of the ‘66s are proving to be charming for
present day drinking, the bigger ones can be counted on to gain com-
plexity and added bouquet and stature for at least another decade.

the north. Full, rich, very distinguished.

1074 CLOS DE VOUGEOT, Grivot ...... 6.79 73.35
Comes from the upper part of the vineyard where the finer wines are
produced. Schoonmaker states, ‘‘distinguished more for its breed and
bouquet than for its body and power.”

916 CORTON, Cuvee Docteur Peste ..... 7:79 8415
Consistently commands the highest price of any of the barrels offered
at the Hospices de Beaune auction. Noble heritage. Only 480 cases pro-
duced. By far, the greatest single red wine vineyard of the Cote de
Beaune and the Hospices sale.

906 CHAMBERTIN, CLOS DE BEZE,
Gelinas ce 9.95 107.45

From Schoonmaker’s Encyclopedia, ‘authentic Chambertin is invariably
expensive but is worth what it costs, for there is no better red Burgundy
and few as good—powerful, long-lived, with astonishing class and breed’.

1069 MUSIGNY, VIEILLES VIGNES,
Comte de Vogue... .......4...6.. 16.50 178.00

A small portion of this 16-acre treasured vineyard is still planted in pre-
phylloxera vines that pre-date the 1870s. It remains the proud property
of Comte de Vogue. Most experts agree that this noble, long-lived, Bur-
gundian classic represents the highest heights achievable on the Cote
d’Or. We were fortunate to be able to obtain a few cases.

*Wines bearing an asterisk are available in half bottles—and for
immediate delivery—at $3.00 the case additional.
