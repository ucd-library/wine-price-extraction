EZRA BROOKS represents an
early 19th Century Kentucky tradition.
The taste is old-fashioned, mellow, well-
rounded and flavorsome. The age is 7
years, the proof is 90, and the price is
less than you think.

Somehow, on
each of our trips to
the vineyards we
manage to detour to
the Cognac area to
_ visit our good friends
rey at MINE. |t ts une
Wo doubtedly the supe-
rior quality of their
Cognac that inspires —_

for this post-war period can

tional relations. But it can be
found in the field of liqueurs —
the happy alliance of ‘‘Bene-
dictine & Brandy” — better
known as B & B.
