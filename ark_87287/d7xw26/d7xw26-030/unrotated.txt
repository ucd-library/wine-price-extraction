  

RED BURGUNDY (cont'd)
1963 VINTAGE

Far from a banner year in Burgundy, 1963 did turn out some
astonishing surprises. Certainly the Clos de la Roche of Ponsot
and the Grands Echezeaux of Mugneret will provide superb
Burgundy at dramatically low cost for those who choose to
adventure.

However, the most startling of the 63s come from that glitter-
ing jewel of Burgundy—the Domaine de la Romanee-Conti. The
proprietors gambled on a harvest, waiting two weeks after
most other growers had picked, thus reaping the benefits of
steady sunshine during that fortnight. Ready to drink now,
these extraordinary wines of the Domaine de la Romanee-Conti
can hold their heads high in the best of company.

283 aoe te ee OC, viene oe 3.99 43.10

Burgundy, particularly when Ponsot is the estate-bottler.
Don’t let the low price discourage you—you will fall in
love with this wine.

278 «=. GRANDS LOMEZEAUS cose ee: 4.99 53.90

638: LA TAGHE : 2. ie 13.95 150.65
In our opinion, La Tache is quite the equal.of Romanee-
Conti itself, though substantially lower in price level.
Fantastic and memorable.

1962 VINTAGE

The recent Time-Life Wine Book states ‘“‘The ’62s are not simply
good, but can be considered great. Red Burgundies ideally
suited for present drinking.”

289 AUXEY-DURESS, DURESSES ........... 4.39 47.40
We share the opinion of Andre Surmain of the Lutece
Restaurant who believes this relatively unknown Bur-
gundy represents the best value for those who want out-
standing wine at relatively modest cost. Estate-bottled,
René Roy.

325 CORTON MAREGCHAUDES .............. 8.49 91.70

tion. Estate-bottled, Camus.

OLDER RED BURGUNDIES

‘Three authentic survivors of the famed Albert Barolet collec-
tion still remain in our cellars. Dr. Barolet was one of the most
distinguished physicians in the Burgundy area. He died in 1969
at the age of 71. These three noble red wines are from his
extraordinary estate, possibly the most important wine legacy
left in Burgundy during the 20th century.

598 VOSNE-ROMANEE 1953 .......-----+-+-: 13.50 145.00
The most remarkable wine-producing commune of all
France. Fine, with very rich overtones. Bouquet out-
standing—flavorful.

529 CHAMBOLLE MUSIGNY 1952 ........-.-- 16.50 175.00
1952 is among the most long-lived years in Burgundy,
and this wine proves it—just emerging. Beautiful color,
not big, but beautifully balanced.

460 POMMARD RUGIENS 1928 .........---- 29.75 321.30
Some consider this the most distinguished denizen of the
fabulous Dr. Barolet cellar. Utterly remarkable. Amazing
that a Burgundy almost 50 years old tastes this young

and beautiful.

   
   
 
 
  
   
 
  
  
  
  
  
  
    
   
 
  
 
 
   
  
 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
  
 
  
 
  
 
 
 
  
 
 
   
  
  
  
  
  
  
 
 
  
  
 
  
 
 
  
 
  
 
 
 
 
   
  
 
 
  
  
  
 
 
  
 
  
 
   

RHONE VALLEY

The Rhone river starts in Switzerland and empties into the
Mediterranean. Red and white wines flourish along its entire
length. The important wine section is south of Lyon and in-
cludes all of the world-famed names listed below.

RED RHONE WINES

No. Bottle Case
599 COTES DU RHONE ROUGE 1971........ 1.99 22.50
The CRAIG CLAIBORNE JOURNAL reports in its April issue,
‘We found a red wine that is honest and dry and clean to the
palate. It is a 1971 from the Rhone Valley, bottled at the vine-
yard called La Vieille Ferme—it is excellent and the equal, we
feel, of the much better known and neighboring Chateauneuf-
du-Pape, which it resembles. We predict that if the wine is
properly stored, it will have softer qualities within a year or
two.”

Incidently, for those who would want further information about
subscribing to the ‘Craig Claiborne Journal,’ it is suggested that
you write Craig Claiborne, P.O. Box EEAA, Easthampton, N.Y.

SPECIAL OFFERING—Five (5) cases, totaling 60 bottles for

full season’s supply of top-flight red wine?

587 CROZES HERMITAGE 1967 ............. 2.99 32.30
From the vineyards surrounding Hermitage overlooking
the Rhone Valley. Similar in characteristics to Hermitage
itself, but with a little less depth, maturing more quickly
—however, it is considerably less expensive. Estate-
bottled, Fayolle.

585 GIGONDAS 1970) 2.30) Se 3.19 34.45
Gigondas is a snuperior example of red Rhone wine—the
very wine featured at the Hostelerie de Beaumaniere at
Les Baux. Caves St. Pierre.

538. (GORNAS 1969: -. 03 eee 3.29 35.55
Nestling inthe hills, near the Rhone Valley, just south of
Lyon, is the cornas vineyard—a most satisfying example
of red wine. Clape.

815 Si, JOSEPH 196068 3. ieee 3.79 40.95
One bank of the Rhone River produces Hermitage—the
opposite bank produces St. Joseph. The grape varieties
and taste qualities are similar, although the Hermitage
generally reaches more exalted heights. Estate-bottled,
Florentin.

577. CHATEAUNEUF-DU-PAPE 1967 ......... 3.99 43.10
There is an eagle’s nest vineyard towering over the town
of Chateauneuf-du-Pape which is called Domaine de
Beaucastel. It is at this vineyard that this glorious ex-
ample of an outstandingly fine red Rhone Valley wine is
estate-bottled. It is now in balance, with five years of
aging, and you will be delighted with it.

drive south of the famed Pyramide Restaurant in Vienne.
The incredibly steep vineyard faces due south, held up
by sturdy retaining walls, and everything must be culti-
vated by hand. Deep in color, full-bodied, amazingly
Jong life, and everyone looks for the aroma of violets
when they drink ‘Céte Rotie.’ Estate-bottled, Domaine
Devieux.

813 HERMITAGE 1970 .............---eeeees 5.49 59.30
Estate-bottled, Domaine Jallade. The vineyard is ‘pure
rock’ and faces due south. George Saintsbury described
it as “the manliest wine” he has ever drunk.
