The wines of the DOMAINE DE LA
ROMANEE-CONTI, because of their scar-
city and magnificence, have always been
collector’s items among serious wine
drinkers. We proudly offer two fine vintages
__the remarkable ’63s, which were picked
three weeks after their neighbors and hence
enjoyed more richness, sunshine and bal-
ance—and the classic ’69s, which reached
new heights in longevity and excellence at
the Domaine. All are scarce and irreplace-
able—we suggest acquisition before they
disappear from the market.

The Greatest White Wines of France

From the Leading White Wine Estates of Burgundy

Here are the great white wine vineyards of
Burgundy. Each is small, noble, and estate-
bottled by the most reliable and reputable
crowers of the wine communes that proudly
proclaim ownership of these top flight vine-
yards. M. Laneyrie, the President of the
Wine Growers of Pouilly and Fuissé, is
generally acknowledged as the man who
produces the best of the area; Robert Vo-
coret is Mayor of Chablis and his ‘Le Clos,’
a Grand Cru, makes a bid towards being
the best single wine of the area; M. Sauzet
is President of White Wine Growers of
Burgundy and his Puligny-Montrachet is
legendary; our favorite white Burgundies
come from the cellars of Bachelet-Ramonet;
and as for Montrachet, the greatest single
dry white wine of France—the fact that we
can offer it at all, because it is so hard to
come by, is remarkable in itself. Choose
among these noblemen— you will not
regret it.
