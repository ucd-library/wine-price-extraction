VANDERMINT

Minted Chocolate Liqueur

 
   

The Dutch have long been
famous for their superb
blending of rich chocolate.
Here it is combined with a
subtle touch of fresh Mint to
achieve the superb flavor of
this delicious cordial. Even
the distinctive Delft-like bot-
tle is typically Dutch.

Certainly, it will be appreci-
ated as a holiday gift. But
for your own pleasure, we
suggest you serve it neat,
on-the-rocks, or simply pour
Y2 oz. of Vandermint over
the rocks, adding 1 oz. of
Vodka.

Vodka From Poland

Poland claims that it is
their land, and not Rus-
sia, that first created
Vodka. We do not know
which one is right — but
we do know that this is
an excellent example of
80 proof Central Euro-
pean Vodka.
