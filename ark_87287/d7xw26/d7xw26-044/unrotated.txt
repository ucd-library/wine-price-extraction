The Most Royal
of all Scotches
Chivas 12 Year Old

There is a glory in this
Scotch thoroughbred. It ap-
peals to the eye, to the
taste, and to the sense of
uncompromising excellence.
If you intend sending Chivas
as a gift, the gold embossed
carton will add dignified
charm and richness. If you
propose to drink it yourself
during the holidays, you
could not do better.

THE WORLD’S MOST RENOWNED
CREME DE MENTHE
(Green and White)

We have just returned from a tour of France, visiting
bars, restaurants and cafes everywhere. We spoke about
wines and spirits with many of the proprietors. We par-
ticularly asked why GET was the Creme de Menthe that
dominated every bar, and was recommended so highly.
The answers were spontaneous and enthusiastic. They
all considered the White and Green Menthe made by
GET the best of Europe, the most concentrated in pep-
permint flavor, the least cloying on the palate, and the
most refreshing.

Being skeptical by nature, we conducted our own com-
parative tastings and we are quite in accord with their
findings. Perhaps the reason is that the firm of GET
specializes particularly in Green and White Mint, and
such concentration of effort can achieve the greatest
heights. Whatever the reason, we found it eminently
Satisfying, and we are certain you will enjoy it as a
spritely, cooling finale at the end of the dinner party.

CHIVAS REGAL 21 YEAR OLD ROYAL
SALUTE IN SPODE CERAMIC FLAGON

 

A ROYAL SALUTE to the royal sovereign is marked by
firing 21 guns—a royal salute in the world of Scotch
Whiskeys is marked by 21 years of aging in oak cask.
Both represent tradition and excellence.
We all know how good this aged Whiskey is. But the
flagon also deserves a salute. It is fired by SPODE of
England, whose bone china has become world-famous.
Not averse to gilding the lily, this noble product is also
encased in an attractive royal purple velvet opera bag.
Not inexpensive—but what a gift! (Below 297.56 case)
