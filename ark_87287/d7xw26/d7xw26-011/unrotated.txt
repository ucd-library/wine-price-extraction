glittering enough even in the ordi-
nary bottle. In the dramatic, im-
pressive MAGNUM it becomes the
most glorious of all Champagnes,
whether it be a gift, or at your
Christmas dinner (190.84 case)

Magnum 35.44

“D-5” It is a wise man who sends
a case or a few bottles of the mag-
nificent CHATEAU LASCOMBES
1967 as his personal Christmas
greeting (a gift that will improve
with time). (70.10 case) 6.49

‘*D-9’’ The
only thing
more French
than Grenou-
ille, or ‘‘frog’s
legs,” is LA
SEINE — not
only the river,
but this su-
perb apéritif
—drink it over
ice, mix with
soda.

“D-2” The river Spey yields the
best salmon and best Whisky of
Scotland. Why? It’s along the
banks of this blessed stream that
SMITH’S GLENLIVET 12 YEAR
OLD UNBLENDED is produced. A
classic that can be served instead
of Cognac — it’s so remarkable.

nacs The SINGLE CASK is unblended
and of the 1934 vintage (Below 15.96).
The GASTON BRIAND is of the 1904 vin-
tage and perhaps the greatest Cognacs

derful. (Below 27.96). Both — Below 43.91

“D-4” The kind of dry Gin that you find
in this rather unique bottle, is the very
taste that is popular in London for Mar-
tinis, ‘Gin & Bitters,’ etc. If, after you
return from Europe, you yearn for the
Gin taste you experienced in London, try
TANQUERAY’S and you will recapture
it. (Below 76.96 case)

“‘D-8’’ Our good friend,
Gregory Thomas prefers
this KIRSCH DE ZOUG to
Framboise, our favorite. The
argument still goes on—
both are noble spirits. But,
we do concede, that this is
truly a wonderful Kirsch.

FITE ROTHSCHILD 1966. Chateau bot-
