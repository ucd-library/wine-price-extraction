you aware that the great 1970 red wines of Bordeaux
can be acquired now, prior to their bottling, and at
prices that will certainly prove to be lower than what
you will probably ultimately have to pay for them two
or three years hence.

The 1970 wines were quickly spoken for and everyone
waited with bated breath for the quality appraisal of
the ’71s and their opening prices. To the astonishment
of everyone, the 1971 vintage in Bordeaux opened at
dramatically higher prices than 1970. This resulted
directly from low yield of the harvest and ever-increas-
ing world demand. We all know how fabulous 1970
was in terms of warmth, depth of flavor and longevity.

WHAT ABOUT 1971? On an overall basis, its excel-
lence is not universally up to 1970. In 1971, it is more
irregular with some vineyards being better than 1970,
some the equal and many less good. We certainly know
that Lafite Rothschild, Picon Lalande, and Chateau
Bouscaut will be as good as ’70, if not better. We also
know that the price of the 1971s will continue to rise
based on the fact that the succeeding vintage, 1972,
is not the match of the previous two years in overall
quality. In summary, we would advise that you buy a
proportionately higher quantity of the ’70s but not to
neglect acquiring at least some of the ’71s to fortify
your cellar against the years ahead.

CHATEAU GREYSAC (Medoc)...... 39.75 39.75

A ‘sleeper.’ From an astonishingly fine Medoc vineyard
proudly owned by Georges Hereil, creator of the Caravelle
airplane, and now Honorary Chairman of Chrysler-Interna-
tional. His dedication to excellence is reflected in this long-
lived, noble wine.

CHATEAU FOURCAS-HOSTEIN

(Pisteae). 6 ee 39.75 —
Noble Medoc vineyard recently acquired by a group of wine-
loving Americans. Excellent, recommended.

CHATEAU CAMENSAC

(Haut Medac) 2.0.0. 42.50 ee
A sleeper. Classified 5th Growth in 1855 and among the 62
great vineyards of Bordeaux. Worth much more.

CHATEAU DASSAULT

(St. MaaihGn) 26 42.75 —_
Just awarded the high classification of ‘Grand Crw’ in St.
Emilion. This recognition was earned by dramatic recent
improvement in quality inspired by the proprietor, Marcel
Dassault, the famed airplane designer.

CHATEAU BOUSCAUT (Graves)... 54.75 57.90
There are 12 ‘Grand Cru’ classified vineyards in Graves,
among which Chateau Haut Brion reigns supreme. In this
noble class can be found Chateau Bouscaut—a wine that
develops more quickly than a comparable Medoc, yet still
retains the virtues of long life. Even a 1928 Bouscaut tastes
virile today.

CHATEAU PHELAN SEGUR

(Si. Beloahe) ok ae 63.00 54.00
An across-the-road neighbor of the more highly classified
Chateau Calon Segur. Similar in characteristics.

CHATEAU LAFON-ROCHET

(Si Fleune) 66 68.50 _
Awarded first prize after blind tasting by L’Academie du
Vin as the best wine produced during the 1970 vintage in St.
Estephe—no small distinction since it was competing against
the other classified famed growths.

CHATEAU GISCOURS (Margaux)... 84.25 90.75
This 3rd growth 1855 classification Margaux is highly per-
fumed, elegant, and endowed with great longevity. Superb.

CHATEAU GLORIA (St. Julien)... 84.25 90.75
Noble vineyard owned by Henri Martin, President of Bor-
deaux Wine Growers Association, and Managing Director of
Chateau Latour. In league with ‘Grand Crus.’

CHATEAU RAUSAN SEGLA

(Matiauky 5 89.75 89.75
Thomas Jefferson once wrote, “Razan-Margau, this is what I
import for myself.” (Note the archaic 18th Century spelling
—nevertheless, Mr. Jefferson was referring to this specific
vineyard.)

M-20A CHATEAU DUHART MILON

Sherry-Lehmann, Inc., 679 Madison Avenue, New York, N.Y. 10021

ROTHSCHILD (Pauillac)............ 94.50 116.00

Adjacent to Chateau Lafite, sharing the same proprietor,
Baron Elie de Rothschild. The Baron is sufficiently proud
of the wine which is produced at this 1855 classification vine
yard to motivate him to add his name to the label. Elegance
and depth are beautifully harmonized.
