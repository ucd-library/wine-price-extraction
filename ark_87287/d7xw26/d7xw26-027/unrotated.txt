1969 VINTAGE

There is an up-to-date vintage chart in the book “How To Eat
Better For Less Money” which describes the 1969 vintage in
white Burgundy as follows, “like the red Burgundies, the whites
have been produced in limited quantity, are extremely expen-
sive and are truly great. Be on the lookout for them. They are
long-lived.”
