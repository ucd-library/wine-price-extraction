RED COUNTRY WINES

Here are the local ‘vin du pays’ wines of France that bring so
much joy to tourists who explore the French countryside. Each
has its own personality, its own message, its own touch of
charm. They were not easy to come by since many of the
growers are not export-minded. Undoubtedly, you have heard
about some of them, have read of their virtues in literature—
and we happily bring them to you.

VIN ROSE (PINK WINES)

Here are the most carefree wines of all—the versatile pink Vin
Rosé that go with almost anything. We think you will find the
best of Europe and the United States listed below.

Bottle Case

MINERVOIS ROSE 1970 (Gold Award)... 1.79 19.35
Each bottle proudly bears a seal announcing the fact
that this very wine won the Gold Award at the Macon
Fair. It is grown in the hilly country of the Languedoc,
not far from Provence.

ALMADEN GRENACHE ROSE........-.- 1.98 21.33
The ‘Gone With The Wind’ best-seller of northern Cali-
fornia. Our tasting notes indicate that this well-made
wine will stand up against almost any other Vin Rosé.
ALOUETTE, ANJOU ROSE 1971......... 2.19 23.65
Good Vin Rosé should be fruity and the Loire Valley is
noted for its fruit. From the distinguished Cooperative
of St. Cyr.

PROVENGE ROSE 1970..........--+++:- 2.19 23.65
Hereby hangs the tale. Jacques Loussier is handsome,
distinguished, and one of France’s best contemporary
composers. You may have already heard his improvisa-
tions of Bach on records which are popular throughout
the world. You may have even heard him in concert with
his group at the Philharmonic. Mr. Loussier loves the
wines of his beloved France so much that he bought a
vineyard in Provence. He only produces Vin Rosé and
his wine reflects his creativity, charm, and dedication.
Try it-you will come back for more.

SONOMA VINEYARDS VIN ROSE....... 2.59 29.58

valleys. Here is an outstanding example.
