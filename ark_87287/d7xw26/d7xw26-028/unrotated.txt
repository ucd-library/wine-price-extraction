  

BEAUJOLAIS

Here are the most beloved red wines of France. Rich in fruit
charm, and innocent attractiveness—wines that do not pire
intellectual qualities, but rather easy sensuality. In short, they
are not wines to be laid down for future drinking but to be
consumed joyously during the first few years of their life. All
of those listed below are from impeccable sources and among
them there is the Chateau de La Chaize—a vineyard that enjoys
the reputation of perhaps being the best single source of Beau-
jolais of the entire area.

1972 VINTAGE

The 1971 vintage in Beaujolais was atypical—it was rich in
tannin and concentration of flavor, developing longevity and
depth but with less obvious fruit. 1972 reverts back to what
Beaujolais is all about—this means a simple wine, very light,
fruity and designed for drinking over a short period of time,
not for laying down. Two of the best ’72s have reached us and
they are here for immediate enjoyment or as a joyous wine to
send to a friend for Christmas. The third one, Brouilly 1972,
Chateau de La Chaize, will not reach us until March 1st but is
well worth waiting for. If you buy it now and await March
delivery, you will save almost $5.00 for the case. A good in-
vestment for the farsighted.

From a farmers cooperative in Beaujolais. Typical, fruity,
utterly delicious. Your friends will love it if you send it
as a gift and you will enjoy it during the holiday period.

319° BEAUJOLAIG: ST. ANDEE......-..-..--- 3.39 36.61
Here is the very wine that many of you have read about
in NEW YORK MAGAZINE and in our full-page Ad that
appeared recently in the NEW YORK TIMES. Hundreds
of cases have already been spoken for, appreciated, and
reordered. It reached us by air lift on a Douglas-DC 8 to
make certain it was here for the holiday period. Like
butterflies and wild daisies, its pleasures are transient.
It will bring its touch of delight between now and next
Summer-—please drink it by then.

F-1 BROUILLY—CHATEAU DE LE CHAIZE... 38.50
The two Beaujolais listed above are available for imme-
diate delivery but you will have to wait until March to
enjoy the majesty of the best vineyard of all of Beaujo-
lais—Chateau de La Chaize. In March, it will be about
$43.00 the case. If you buy it now, it will cost you only
$38.50 but you must patiently await its delivery. This
vineyard has consistently won the Gold Award at both
the Macon and Paris Fairs during the last 4 years. It is
an odds-on favorite in the open competition that will
take place next Spring. In any event, now is the time to
save almost $5.00 the case. Also available in half-bottles
and magnums at $3.00 the case additional.

La Marquise de Roussy de Sales and the vignerons are happy as
they gather the 1972 Beaujolais harvest. You can share In their
joy if you order the 1972 vintage now, and have the patience to
await this truly remarkable Brouilly, Chateau de La Chaize, which
will reach you by early March. You will save almost $5.00 the case
if you order now and the reward will be great in March. The best
of Beaujolais takes a little longer but we know of no better way
of launching the spring season of 1973.

Brouilly is one of the 9 great townships of Beaujolais. It

BROUILLY, CHATEAU DE LA CHAIZE.. 3.69 39.85

Peterson f This. Brouilly 1971, estate-
bottled at Chateau de La
Chaize, has won the Gold
Award at the Macon Fair as
the best produced during the
1971 vintage. It has consist-
ently been the best-selling
red wine in our history—
everyone loves it and comes
back for more. The Chateau
de La Chaize vineyard, in
: ‘ the famed wine-growing dis-
- —— trict of Brouilly, has been
maintained from father to son for over 4 centuries by
the Marquis de Roussy de Sales family. Since every
bottle comes from the estate, and the quantity that we
will receive is less than the demand, we urge that you
order promptly to avoid disappointment. Also available
in half-bottles and magnums.

BEAUJOLAIS VILLAGES ..............- 2.69 29.95
This wine traces its origin to the Chateau de La Chaize
vineyard described above. Actually, every drop comes
from the Brouilly vineyard of the Marquis de Roussy de
Sales but the name had to be changed to ‘Villages.’ Why?
Under French law, a grower is only entitled to produce
so many cases per acre. He must move to a lower classi-
fication any overproduction. This wine represents over-
production but is indistinguishable to the palate from
Brouilly itself. If you are interested in what is in the
bottle rather than what is on the label, we offer you here
the best single value of all Beaujolais. Also available in
half-bottles at $1.49 each, $32.95 the case of 24. In mag-
nums, $5.96 each, $32.95 the case of 6.

BEAUJOLAIS SUPERIEUR ..........---- 2.99 32.30
Estate-bottled at the renowned Chateau de Pizay. Out-
standing example from some of the best soil of Beau-
jolais.

BEAUJOLAIS CHENAS ..........--.---- 2.99 32.30
A superb Beaujolais, estate-bottled at the Domaine
Laneyrie, produced in Chenas, one of the nine great wine
growing villages of Beaujolais. Outstanding.

FLEURIE (Rt. Hon. Ernest Marples)...... 2.99 32.30
The Rt. Hon. Ernest Marples owns the ‘Les Laverts’ vine-
yard in the heart of Fleurie. It represents in beautiful
fashion the heights that an estate-bottled Beaujolais can
achieve. The fruit, balance, bouquet all combine to
achieve delightful high expression. Also available in
half-bottles and magnums.

BEAUJOLAIS JULIENAS ...........--+:: 3.39 36.60
Estate-bottled, Domaine Laneyrie. Rich in fruit and fla-
vor—superb.

MOULIN-A-VENT (Ernest Marples)...... 3.79 40.95
This wine is described above under 1971. We still have a
few cases of the 1970 that is just coming into its own
with several good years ahead.
