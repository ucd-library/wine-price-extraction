With the prices of many of the famed wines of the world going
up dramatically during the last year, there has been a tendency
for many wine drinkers to turn to Italy to provide good wine
at liberal prices. We have taken the challenge seriously, we
have searched out the best that Italy has to offer, and our taste
selections appear below. Gattinara, Barolo and Carema will
astonish you by their excellence. However, in addition to seek-
ing out the gems, we have concentrated on good Italian red
and white wine designed to provide drinking joy for those who
want to acquire their wines at the lowest possible prices.

ITALIAN RED WINES

No. Bottle Case

627. ROSSO DI VERONA 1970
(Full 332 oz. litre) .........-------+++: 1.79 19.95
Delightful, fruity Italian red wine discovered by FRANK
SCHOONMAKER in Valpolicella country near Verona.
Holds 9% ozs. more than the average bottle, thus making
it a ‘best buy.’

549 LAMBRUSCO AMABILE ...........----- 1.79 19.95
Grapy, rich taste, a trace of sweetness—a truly carefree,
highly popular red wine grown not far from Bologna.
Emilia Vini.

523 CHIANTI MONTEPALDI 1970 .......---- 2.19 23.65
Marchesi Corsini is famed throughout Italy for his re-
markable ‘Riserva’ which is listed below. Even this
modestly priced red reflects his dedication and excel-
lence.

665 BARDOLINO 1970 ........---::5:eeeees: 2.19 23.65
A refreshing, fruity, light red wine grown along the
shores of Lake Garda. Low price for its outstanding
quality. V. Petternella.

621 VALPOLIGELLA 1970 ..........-+----:: 2.19 23.65
Pleasing, ever-popular, fruity light red wine grown near
Verona. Similar to a Beaujolais. Excellent example. V.
Petternella.

531 CHIANTI CLASSICO 1967 ...........--. 2.69 29.05
The family of Marchesi Corsini claim three Popes as part
of their heritage. He owns some of the best vineyard land
of Tuscany, and this ‘Riserva’ is considered one of the
best red wines produced in Italy. Worth at least $1.00
the bottle more.

648 BARBERA 1969 ..........--seeeeeeceees 2.79 30.15
Deep-colored, full-bodied, rich in flavor. Excellent when
young and this wine should be consumed within the
next two or three years. Cherosco-La Morra.

O84. CHITA. BOSE) 6. i ek ries Sone, 2.95 31.85
Classic example of top-flight Chianti.
645 DOLGETIO 1970 ..........:... 02. 2-: 2.99 32.30

Grown on the high slopes of the Piedmont. Soft, quick to
drink, delightful. Cherosco-La Morra.

446 BARDOLINO BOLLA ...............>..: 3.25 35.10
Here is the very wine featured in the Italian restaurants
of Rome and New York.

1038 CHIANTI SERRISTORI 1970

(In Handsome Gigantic 59 oz. Bottle) ... 3.49 19.95
Attention should be paid here! Here is a gay, generous,
gigantic bottle, equal to about two and a half regular
bottles, that comes out less than 6¢ per ounce! Hardly
more than beer! The wine is not just good, but comes
from the cellars of Conti Serristori, one of the most re-
spected growers of Tuscany. The heritage is impeccable
—it was selected for us by Frank Schoonmaker and the
combination of his enthusiasm and what we tasted, per-
suaded us to bring it to you. Six in case.

625 GAREMA 1964 .... 2... s eee eee 3.79 40.95
The wine lovers of Italy are so fond of Carema that
rarely is it ever exported. Made from the Nebbiolo grape
north of Turin. Superb. Luigi Ferrando.

5163 RUSTICANA IN DOUBLE LITRE ........ 3.96 23.61

Here is economy. Equal to almost 3 bottles and it comes
from the superior vineyard soil of Valpolicella. Six in
case.

BAROLO 1966 ........-...--3-<--- 22> 3.99 43.10
Here again, Frank Schoonmaker is proud of this discov-
ery which he found among the hills of Piedmont. We
share his opinion that Barolo is perhaps the best red
wine of all Italy; full-bodied, slow-maturing and com-
parable to a top flight Rhone Valley red. Generally kept
at least three years in wood and then put in ‘Burgundy’
bottles. Powerful, definitely belongs in the ranks of great
red wines.

CHIANTI RISERVA. « «420s en et eaes 4.61 49.79
Demonstrates clearly the excellence that Chianti can
achieve. Estate-bottled, Castle of Brolio.

GATTINARA 1964 ......---seeececeeeees 4.99 53.90
Made from the same grape as Barolo. Grown southwest
of Lake Maggiore. Full-bodied, slow to mature, long-
lived. Can hold its own against the best red wines of the
Rhone Valley. Hard to come by. Antoniolla.

CHIANTI DUCALE GOLD 1959 .........-. 6.59 TiAl
The Chateau Lafite of Italy. Remarkable. Estate-bottled,
Ruffino.

WAROUEQO 1967 2s oo ee ee «0 6.95 75.05
What a glory! If you do not think that the wines of Italy
do not approach greatness, please try this one. Cherosco-
La Morra.

FRASGATI 1969. <2 ....-....------+----> 1.79 19.95
While dining at the Grand Hotel in Rome, we were
amazed by the Frascati they served us—way beyond the
class of any other we experienced. The Grand Hotel
Manager then told us that it comes from the Valle
Vermiglia vineyard, owned by Pietro Campilli, now
Presidet of Italy’s National Economic Council and until
recently, President of Edison Montecatini. Perhaps it
was his devotion to excellence in whatever field he may
be engaged that permitted Mr. Campilli to produce this
agreeable and refreshing white wine.
BIANCO DI VERONA 1970

(Full 33% oz. litre) ..........------++:> 1.79 19.95
FANK SCHOONMAKER again brings joy to the wine
lovers of America. Here is a delicate, dry, eminently sat-
isfying white wine that is the equal of the best Soave you
have ever tasted.
SOAVE 1970 4... 5 ie 2.19 23.65
Perhaps we are prejudiced, but we consider this the best
dry white wine of all Italy. V. Petternella.
Me ge eo ie ie Bh ree fe 2.29 24.73
Grown near Adriatic. In amphora bottle. Dry, very light,
pale, fresh. From the ‘Castelli di Jesi’ vineyards which
sets the standard for all other Verdicchios.

BIANCO RIGASOLI ........------+++::> 2.75 29.70
Dry, golden, relatively full-bodied.
GURL O (Gilly 2.99 32.30

The Dukes of Salaparuta send us this, the best dry
white wine of Sicily.

ANTINORI WHITE CHIANTI ........--- 3.05 32.94
A favorite in the better restaurants of Italy.
CRO UR ea a oe eee 3.15 34.02

From Umbria. In squat straw bottle. Dry, Ruffino.
BIANCO DI TUSCANO 1970

(In Handsome Gigantic 59 oz. Bottle).... 3.49 19.95
Here is the dry white counterpart of the Chianti Ser-
ristori described above. The cost is less than 6¢ per
ounce—do you know of a better bargain in good dry
white wine? It is clean, dry, honest and designed to
cheer. Case of 6.
RUSTICANA IN DOUBLE LITRE ........ 3.96 23.61
A double litre holds almost 3 bottles. If you like Soave,
you will love this one. A ‘best buy.’ Case of 6.
