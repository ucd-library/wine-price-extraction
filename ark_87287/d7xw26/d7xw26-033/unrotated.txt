American Wines have now become of age and we are proud of
what is produced within our borders—we take them seriously.
Perhaps we have not yet achieved a Chateau Lafite-
Rothschild, a Montrachet or a Musigny, but we are well on
our way. It may take another generation, but knowledge, dedi-
cation, trial-and-error will move us closer to the ultimate of
perfection.

In the interval, it is our responsibility to bring you the best of
northern California and New York State. Each wine listed
below has been tasted intrinsically and comparatively. Each
is best within class. If you are interested in experiencing what
the vineyards of America have to offer, the selections below
will bring you this possibility. For those who are familiar with
the better vineyards of America, they will recognize the out-
standing examples listed below. For those who want to learn,
there is much adventure and knowledge to be gained. Happy
comparative tasting!

HEARTY BURGUNDY (Gallo) ........... 1.25 13.95
Don’t scoff. This full-flavored red wine has stood up well
at blind tastings among experts with some of their com-
petitors commanding triple the price. For further econ-
omy, why not buy the full gallon? $4.49 the gallon—it
holds the equivalent of five bottles, which averages out
at 90¢ each—$16.50 the case of four. Not even a thrifty
Frenchman can do better.

MOUNTAIN RED (Almaden) ............ 1.59 17.15
From northern California. Ideally suited for excellent
day-in and day-out drinking. However, for greater econ-
omy, we urge that you buy this very wine in the hand-
some gallon size for $5.31, $f9.15 the case of four gallons.
Each gallon is the equal of five bottles so that if you are
adept at mathematics, you can see that the saving is very
substantial—particularly if you choose to buy a Case,
where there is a further 10% discount.

BOORDY RED 1970 (N.Y. State).......... 1.89 20.50
Philip Wagner, former editor of the Baltimore Sun is the
dedicated proprietor. Grown along the south shores of
Lake Erie, using European hybrid wine grapes. Surpris-

ingly good.

BURGUNDY (Sonoma Vineyards) ....... 2.99 33.95
We have recently returned from the Windsor-Tiburon-
Sonoma Vineyards and spent a day with Rodney Strong,
the Chairman. Here is northern California’s full-flavored

Brother Timothy, the cellar master at this noble Napa
Valley vineyard, has won many prizes for the excellence
of this wine—California’s answer to Bordeaux.

The grape of Beaujolais is treated in beautiful fashion at
Mondavi’s remarkable vineyard in Napa Valley. Sur-

Bottle Case

PINOT NOIR (Sebastiani) .............. 3.25 35.35
Sebastiani and ‘Sonoma’ are synonymous. There is even
a town in the valley named after him. His Pinot Noir has
won awards at California’s fairs.
BULLEN ILE 1971 oe a 3.25 35.10
There is a museum along the shores of the Finger Lakes,

Incomparable quality, small yield—the red wine grape of
Burgundy—excellent.
CABERNET SAUVIGNON

(Sonoma Vineyards) ...............--- 3.49 39.95
America’s best red wine—made from Cabernet Sauvig-
non, the grape that gives the red wines of Bordeaux their
distinction. Here is the kind of wine that should be
bought now and laid down for a year or two so that you
can experience in the future the round, mature excel-
lence that the best red wines of California can aspire to.
PINOT ST. GEORGE (Christian Bros.).... 3.69 39.40

tential at the Christian Bros. Napa Valley sanctuary. Will
intrigue the curious wine drinker.

To get any Cabernet Sauvignon from northern California
is not an easy accomplishment. To get one from Sebas-
tiani is an achievement. Rationed in California.
PINOT NOIR 1969 (R. Mondavi).......... 4.92 53.15
If a Chambertin is to be created in California, it will
probably happen here at the Robert Mondavi vineyard
in Napa Valley.

us this light, dry, fresh white wine.

lent dry white wine.
