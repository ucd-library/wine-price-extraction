OTHER
SPARKLING WINES

The name ‘Champagne’ is guarded jealously in France and only

sparkling wines produced

in the strictly delimited Champagne

district are entitled to bear the name. However, some intriguing
sparkling wines, without the name ‘Champagne’ are made in
other parts of the world.

Bottle Case
PATO FRIO (Cold Duck-Spain).......... 2.99 32.30
In America they ask for ‘Cold Duck’: in Spain, ‘Pato Frio’
is starting to take hold. It is a blend of red and white
crackling wine produced in the Rioja area.
SPARKLING NECTAROSE fetta). 22... 2.99 34.75
We are all familiar with pink champagne. They produce
a counterpart in the Loire Valley and it is less austere,
less dry, and fruitier. It is called SPARKLING NECTA-
ROSE. Only 2 months ago it sold for $5.20. It is available
this holiday period for only $2.99—whether it be for your
own dining pleasure or as a gift to an appreciative
friend. Quantity limited and irreplaceable. Also avail-
able in half-bottles at $1.64 each, $37.75 case.
VERY COLD DUCK (Germany).......... 3.49 39.75
COLD DUCK was invented in Germany. It all had to do
with a Baron who mixed his left-over Champagne and
sparkling Burgundy after a hunt—the remainder from
pre-hunt breakfast. Here is one of the best examples we
have yet run across.

ANJOU BLANC DE BLANGS (Loire). <.. 3.99 43.10
Typical fruit of the Loire Valley. Medium dry.
KRITER BRUT (Burgundy)............... 3.99 43.10

A best-seller in both England and France. Produced in
the southern part of Burgundy. Dry. Also in Magnums.
LAMBRUSCO SPUMANTE [Italy)........ 4.09 44.18
Sparkling red wine produced west of Bologna in north-
ern Italy. Somewhat sweet, with grapey bouquet.
BOYER BRUT 1969 (Haute-Saudie)....... 4.39 47.40
Our most successful sparkling wine because of dry ex-
cellence and dramatically low price. Young, fresh, bone-
dry. Made of superior grape varieties and fermented in
in bottle, as in Champagne. Grown at high altitude in
the French Alps. Also available in half-bottles at $2.39
and Magnums at $9.56.

SPARKLING VOUVRAY (Loire) ......... 4.39 47.40
Fruity, dry sparkling wine made in Vouvray, one of the
choicest sections of the Loire Valley.

LE DUC BLANC DE BLANGCS 1969....... 4.89 52.80
World-recognized example of the excellence of the spar-
kling wine that the high altitude of the French Alps is
capable of producing.

CLOS DES CORDELIERS ROSE BRUT... 4.99 58.50
When we were last in St. Emilion, we were skeptical.
They offered us their sparkling dry pink wine
(Bordeaux’s response to Champagne) and we were en-
chanted by it. You will be, too.

CODORNIU BRUT (Spain)............... 4.99 53.90
The most famed and best dry sparkling wine of Spain.
ASTI SPUMANTI [italy), =. .......22.,. 5.29 57.15

Asti is a town south of Turin which is renowned for its
sparkling wine, relatively sweet.

HENKEL TROCKEN (Germany).......... 5.78 62.53
The best and most famous dry white sparkling wine of
Germany.

CHAUVENET RED CAP (Burgundy)...... 6.99 75.49
Chauvenet Red Cap is to sparkling Burgundy what
Xerox is to copying machines—the most famous and
sought-after and the standard for quality.

   

Last Minute Wine Notes
As We Go To Press

1 — WQXR announces an important wine radio broadcast
that will start immediately and continue indefinitely into the
future, weekdays only, from Monday to Friday. Each day at
7:05 P.M., immediately after the news, Terry Robards will
report on the latest events in the wine world (Mr. Robards is
financial writer for the New York Times and wine writer for
New York Magazine). This radio show promises to be in-
teresting, informative and stimulating.

Immediately after Terry Robards reports, WQXR hopes to
feature a conversation about wine between Burgess Mere-
dith, actor, director, knowledgeable wine lover — and Sam
Aaron, president of Sherry-Lehmann, Inc., author and lec-
turer on the subject of wines — this was not yet confirmed,
but looks probable, as we go to press. We urge that you
listen and learn about the latest developments in vintages,
vineyards, best values in wines, etc. Happy listening!

 

2 — It was ‘stop-the-press’ for us! August Sebastiani is one of
the most important wine producers of Napa-Sonoma Valleys
in California. He has long been an admirer of ‘Beaujolais
Nouveau,’ and decided to do the same thing in California.
He has produced a small quantity of Gamy Beaujolais 1972,
harvested by hand between October 2nd and Sth, bottling it
November 15th, 1972. It is here for you to enjoy and to
compare with the young, fresh Beaujolais we received from
France, Only 400 cases were produced — and it is delicious.
Curious? It is available to you at $2.99 the bottle, $34.75 the
case — quantity limited.

3 — Marquis de Roussy de Sales is the proud proprietor of
the best vineyard of Brouilly in Beaujolais. The wines are
rich in depth, flavor and fruit and are several notches above
the category of ‘Beaujolais Nouveau.’ This glory of Beaujo-
lais will not reach us until March 1st, but it is well worth
waiting for. It will sell for about $43 at that time. If you are
one of the devoted followers of the majestic Chateau de La
Chaize, it is available to you now at $38.50 the case — a sav-
ing of almost $5 — but it must be ordered now, with you
having the patience to wait until March Ist for delivery. Out-
standing investment, both economically and in terms of what
you will experience when the wine arrives.

4 — Chateau Mouton Rothschild 1929 in Double-Magnum
(equal to 4 bottles) twice fetched over $9,000 the Double-
Magnum at auction this year. The 1966 Mouton Rothschild
— another great year — is available for immediate delivery
at $180 the Double-Magnum. What will it be worth 10 years
hence? 20 years hence? 30 years from now? We leave the
answer to you. From the private reserves of Baron Philippe
de Rothschild — quantity limited.

5 — We have just returned from the Sonoma Vineyards that
control almost 3,000 acres of superior grape varieties in the
Napa-Sonoma area. We were astonished by their dedication,
the excellence of the wines, and their brilliant future. Here
is a vineyard that will bring plaudits from wine experts dur-
ing the years ahead. Turn to Pages 28D and 28E and observe
their scope, ranging from Burgundy and Gamay through
Cabernet Sauvignon, Pinot Noir and Pinot Chardonnay.
Glorious wines indeed. We happily report that if you buy a
solid case of 12 bottles of any one varietal — and if the order
reaches us in time — your message, which can include the
name of the recipient, donor and occasion will be imprinted
on each of the 12 labels, free of charge. Please allow 2%
weeks for this process because it takes time for imprinting
and shipping. What a noble Christmas wine gift indeed!

6 — TIME-LIFE are proud of their new magazine that
covers the field of economics, It is called MONEY. The
current December issue goes into great depth on the subject
of ‘wine as an investment.’ Get a copy — you will enjoy and
profit from it.
