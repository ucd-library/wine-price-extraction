 

NEWS! The Beaujolais of C

ARRIVES IN TIME TO
BRING ITS CHARM IO
YOUR HOLIDAY LIVING!

The Brouilly1971 Won Gold Award
at Macon Fair — the Beaujolais
Villages 1970 is Fruity, Charming,
and Just Coming into its Own.

THIS 1971 BEAUJOLAIS BROUILLY, which won the Gold
Award at the Macon Fair, is the proud, estate-bottled wine
srown at Chateau de La Chaize, one of the noblest and most
highly regarded vineyards of all Beaujolais. It has consist-
ently been the best selling red wine in our history—every-
one loves it and comes back for more. Our inventory was
depleted during most of November, but we happily report
a new and last shipment has reached us in time to bring its
fruity, arbor-like delight to your holiday dinner table.

The 1970 BEAUJOLAIS VILLAGES is an intriguing wine
story. Under French law, you are permitted to use the name
‘Brouilly’ only for a limited number of bottles per acre.
Anything beyond that quantity is permitted to take on the
name ‘Beaujolais Villages,’ but its true vineyard origin
‘Brouilly’ must be deleted. In fact, every drop here is from
the Brouilly vineyard and is indistinguishable by any com-
parative tasting. The benefactor here is the consumer who
is more interested in what is in the bottle than what appears
on the label. The proprietor of La Chaize, Marquis de
Roussy de Sales, reduced his price, and the savings are
passed on to you. At $2.69 the bottle, $29.95 the case, our
tasting panel is of the opinion that this is probably the best
value in truly outstanding Beaujolais available to the Amer-

ican public.

THE CHATEAU DE LA CHAIZE vineyard, in the famed
wine-growing district of Brouilly, has been maintained,
from father to son, for over four centuries by the Marquis
de Roussy de Sales family. Tradition dictates that they never
compromise with dedication and excellence. The Marquis
de Roussy de Sales is a director of Christian Dior, spending
most weekends with his charming wife, Nicole, among the
rolling hills of Beaujolais, cultivating the vine.

La Marquise and Marquis de Roussy de Sales are smiling and
happy because they have just gathered their 1972 vintage at
Chateau de La Chaize, and are pleased with what they have brought
in from their vineyards. The ’72s will reach us during March of
1973, and early tastings indicate that they will prove to be fruity,
typical, and excellent.
