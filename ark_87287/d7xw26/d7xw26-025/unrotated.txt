Here again, to preserve objectivity, we quote Frank Schoon-
maker’s recently issued Vintage Chart.

4971. As in red Burgundy, an astonishing year, which brought
more than its share of local disasters, yet many wines destined
to rank among the best of their decade. In the early, pre-dawn
hours of April 29th, most of the best Chablis vineyards—those
on the right or east bank of the Serein, all seven of the Grand
Crus, and many of the Premier Crus as well, notably Montee de
Tonnerre, Monts de Milieu, Vaulorent, Fourchaume—suffered
grave damage from a killing frost, and eventually produced a
scant half-crop at best. The white wine vineyards of the Cote
d’Or, spared this early catastrophe, were ravaged by hail on
August 19th. What has been salvaged appears to be of wholly
remarkable quality, very great white Burgundies, full-bodied,
rather high in alcohol, yet well-balanced and capable of im-
proving if laid away and in this respect unlike any we have
been buying since the 1961s. Certainly a great year,...

We were extremely careful in the selection of red Burgundies,
making certain every one was estate-bottled by an impeccable
grower and each had been tasted by either Frank Schoonmaker
or Robert Haas. We have set up the same high standards of
selection in regard to the 1971 Burgundies that appear below.
You will find them full-bodied, beautifully balanced, and the
most long-lived of all white Burgundies since the. memorable
1961s. Many of them will be spoken for quickly—so we suggest
ordering promptly.
