Emperor Franz Josef had a favorite wine and it was
Loibner Kaiserwein—perhaps the best single dry white
wine of all Austria—and note how inexpensive, in light

THE WINES OF YUGO-SLAVIA

Yugo-Slavian vineyards are on the same temperate zone lati-
tude as Piedmont, Bordeaux, and the Rhone Valley. Wine-
making can be traced back to the 6th Century. Here are their
best red and best white at dramatically low prices.

deaux.

THE WINES OF ROUMANIA

Wine was known in Roumania even before the Greeks founded
the Black Sea colonies. These wines are exported to West Ger-
many, Austria, Great Britain, and the Common Market. They
are evidently appreciated because their sales keep marching
upwards to these countries.
