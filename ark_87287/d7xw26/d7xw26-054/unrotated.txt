Audubon drew it... the great, golden bronze bird... so
American that Benjamin Franklin urged its adoption as
Our national symbol... can outrun a galloping horse...
hunters testify to its Sagacity... the Tom wild turkey is
the undisputed master of his harem... civilization en-
croached, and not too many remain in the land... but
we happily report that WILD TURKEY BOURBON is stil
among us to add its distinction to your own drinking—
and its uniqueness to your gift-giving.

SPAIN SENDS US ITS NOBLEST SELECTION
in handsome, useful cork chest.

6 Bottles of sackcloth-covered DRY SACK SHERRY,
(No extra charge for cork chest.)

Do you know of any gift that would be more
appreciated on Christmas morning under
the tree? Spain is rightfully proud of the
cork that it produces and its artistic ex-
pression that you see here. Spain is equally
proud of the remarkable Sherries that it
produces, particularly the medium dry DRY
SACK. You can buy an individual bottle in
its festive sackcloth wrapping for only 4.98.
But to reach an ultimate expression in gift-
giving, we strongly advise that you send 6
bottles in the cork chest for only 29.88
complete.

A word of caution — there are not many of
these cork containers in our inventory—they
will be depleted quickly — so we strongly
urge ordering early.
