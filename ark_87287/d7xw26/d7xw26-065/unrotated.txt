In Sturdy Blue Denim Tote Bag

PICK NINE HALF BOTTLES of your choice
—nestling comfortably in the gay, useful and
delightful sturdy blue denim tote bag (only
$4.95 additional—we have seen these same
tote bags priced in department stores at over
$10 each). Half bottles of Champagne are
charming, practical, imaginative, and in the
spirit of holiday festivity. Your gift will be-
come doubly precious when beautifully pre-

sented in the blue denim tote bag.

NOTE:

THE WHOLE TOWN’S TALKING ABOUT DELIGHTFUL
NEW GIFT IDEA

 

If the blue denim TOTE BAG intrigues you, you are not restricted to Champagne alone. You can send up to six bottles of your favorite
wine, Scotch, Gin or Bourbon, or any other items. Simply make your selection and add only $4.95 for Tote Bag (our comparative shoppers
tell us that this bag, without contents, sells for over $10 in leading department stores).
