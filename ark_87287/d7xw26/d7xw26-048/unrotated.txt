For the first time in America you can recapture
a 19th Century French Christmas gift custom—
giving the lucky recipient a FULL BARREL of
good French red wine. The barrel holds the
equivalent of 26 regular bottles, held in a poly-
etheline sack that protects it from oxidation.
Just turn the spigot and out comes a good
young red wine, which the importer informs us
was produced at a farmers’ cooperative in Beau-
jolais. We have tasted the wine and it 1s fresh,
fruity, and utterly delicious,
