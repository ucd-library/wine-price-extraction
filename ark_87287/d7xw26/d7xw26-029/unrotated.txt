  

RED BURGUNDIES

Among recent vintages, ‘1970’ was the ‘star’ in Bordeaux; the
‘1969’ took the center of the stage in Burgundy. As in Bordeaux,
the world demand for the great vineyards of Burgundy are out-
stripping the limited capacity of the vignerons to produce. The
result has been that wine prices at the leading vineyards have
been spiraling upwards, complicated by a low harvest yield in
1971, devaluation, and an eagerness on the part of the Burgun-
dians to achieve the high prices commanded by the great vine-
yards of Bordeaux.

Below, we are dealing with great vintage years from top-flight
vineyards. The cellars of Burgundy are now denuded, but we
happily report that we have brought some of the gems to our
friends in America. Choose among them.

1969 VINTAGE

We know of no better way of testifying to the true excellence
of the 1969 red Burgundies than to simply quote Frank Schoon-
maker’s recently issued Vintage Report, 1969 is an exceedingly
great year in Burgundy, quite in the class with fabulous 1961
... deep-colored, rich, everything that fine Burgundies should
be...a few conceivably even 20/20, which is as high as I can
go.’ We know of no more persuasive statement to justify an-
ticipating your future requirements than the objective evalua-
ation by Mr. Schoonmaker—an opinion share unanimously by
the Burgundy wine growers’ community.
