“The very existence, let alone the sheer per-
fection, of these Madeiras is an historic wine
event—these 19th Century Madeiras have pro-
vided one of the great wine tasting experiences
of my life,” states James Beard.

When these irreplaceable and aged thorough-
breds are gone, the opportunity to taste authen-
tic old vintage Madeiras of this caliber will be
lost forever.
