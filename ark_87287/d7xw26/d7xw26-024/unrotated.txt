1959 CHATEAU BOTTLED

     

1959 was hailed as the “vintage of the century.’ With the pas-
sage of time, we think ’61 and ’70 may have surpassed this
highly publicized year. Those that survive are glorious, ex-
tremely expensive, and will excite wine-lovers everywhere.
We do not have many of them left to offer and we list them

below.

1952 CHATEAU BOTTLED

  

During the early life of the 52s, they contained an excess of
tannin which obscured the fruit. This has changed—they are
now coming into their own, can be enjoyed now with a long,
long life ahead.
