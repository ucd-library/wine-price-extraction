1970 REGIONALS

Don't let the low prices at which we are offering these out-
standing regional Bordeaux wines dishearten you. They are not
run-of-the-mill—each of these wines traces its origin to a spe-
cific vineyard, placing them into a more thoroughbred class.
Ideally suited for drinking day-in and day-out.

713 BORDEAUX ROUGE, Chat. Rousselot.... 1.99 22.50
810 MEDOC, Domaine des Lauiers........-.- 2.79 30.15
670 ST. EMILION, Chat. de Lescours......... 2.89 31.20

SANS-ANNEE

These two wines should not be overlooked. The ‘Simplet,’ is
beautifully balanced and a delight. The ‘Chateau Bahans Haut
Brion’ was grown and bottled at the famed Chateau Haut Brion
vineyard and is a blend of the 1964 and 1965 vintages. Extra-
ordinary opportunity for those who want truly outstanding
wine at relatively modest cost.

223 SIMPLET, Guy Schyler..............---- 2.19 24.50
260 CHATEAU BAHANS HAUT BRION...... 4.39 47.40

1969 CHATEAU BOTTLED

Because of half a normal production, the opening prices of the

1969 were record-breaking. Some exceptional examples have

reached our shore. Here are some outstanding values below

$3.00 a bottle from excellent vineyards of Bordeaux.

409i CHATEAU BELLEVUE .........+-.-+5«+. 2.19 23.65
Our 1967 ran out quickly because everyone loved this
wine and came back for more. The excellent 1969 is now
here.

314 CHATEAU GUIRAUD-CHEVAL ......... 2.89 31.20
Cote de Bourg sends us this delicious wine. Not chateau-
bottled, but a delight—outstanding value and good wine.

248. CHATEAU COUTELIN-MERVILLE ...... 2.99 32.30
St. Estephe. Superior. Bottled by Eschenauer.
240 CHATEAU HANTEILLAN ............... 2.99 32.30

Fine Medoc, recently bottled in Bordeaux by Eschenauer.
This is the very wine that was chosen in a blind compe-
titive tasting by AIR FRANCE to serve on their European
flights.

168 CHATEAU CANON DE BREM........... 2.99 32.30
A chateau-bottled discovery from Canon-Fronsac—vine-
yards overlook the Medoc from the opposite shore of the
Gironde. ‘A best buy.’

255 CHATEAU LOUDENNE .........-------. 2.99 32.30
We love Martin Bamford, the Managing Director, and the
wine that he has produced here. Please visit his vineyard
when you are next in Bordeaux—you will never regret it.

ini « CHATEAU SIMARD ..........---..-.... 4.49 48.50
Here is the very vineyard that was served at El Morocco
to celebrate one of the more important anniversaries of
this year. Popular in all of the leading French restaurants

of New York.

380 CHATEAU LATOUR GARNET. 2. 2. =.. 4.89 52.80
Classified ‘Grand Cru Medoc’ in 1855. Excellent.

164 CHATEAU TAFON-ROGHED .2....2...--- 4.99 53.90

One of the great ‘Grand Crus’ of St. Estephe. Long-lived,
superb, ideal for laying down.

133 CHATEAU BOUSCAUT ..........--...-- 4.99 53.90
We are now dealing with the first vintage produced
under the dedicated supervision of the new Managing
Director, Jean Delmas—the man who is also Managing
Director of Chateau Haut Brion. This vintage proves
clearly the up-grading that can result from care, loving
devotion, selection, and superior vinification.

1968 CHATEAU BOTTLED

Likely to be overlooked as a vintage, but certainly the ’68s are
much better than the ’63s and ’65s. The great vineyards listed
below, through selection and reduction of total quantity, have
been able to provide truly excellent wines and are ideally
suited for present drinking. Here are some giants of Bordeaux
that can be consumed now at a price much below the value of
the intrinsic excellence you will experience. The Latour and
Petrus are priced here below the present replacement cost in
Bordeaux.

259 CHATEAU LEOVILLE LASCASES....... 3.99 43.10
St. Julien. One of the most sought-after of the Medocs.
178 CHATEAU CALON SEGUR............-- 3.99 43.10

St. Estephe. Usually, this vineyard produces wines that
take a decade to mature. In a light year such as ’68 you
have a happy harmony. Ready now.

1988. GHATEAU LATOUR .... cae ess cose 8.99 97.10
A Pauillac giant. Latour often reaches great heights in
unfashionable years. ‘A best buy’ for those who want to
experience the elegance of Latour at a non-staggering
price.

155  GHATEAU PETRUS. ......--...--.-.--- 8.99 97.10
Chateau Petrus—the giant of Pomerol—is hard to come by
and usually commands over $20 the bottle. It was excel-
lent in 1968 and we have a few cases available at a
liveable cost.

1967 CHATEAU BOTTLED

Exceptionally fine, soft, fruity, quicker to mature than 1966. It
took a while, but the current quotations in Bordeaux for 67
now approximate those that are being quoted for 66. If you
want superb claret for drinking during the next two or three
years, we suggest the ’67 rather than the ’66s which are slower
to mature.

231 CHATEAU HANTEILLAN : 32. 5.08 2.89 31.20
The wine of AIR FRANCE. Now has sufficient bottle age
to give softness. Bottled in Bordeaux by Eschenauer.

145 CHATEAU COUTELIN-MERVILLE ...... 2.99 32.30
Excellent St. Estephe—bottled by Eschenaugr. Just com-
ing into its own—long life ahead.

139 CHATEAU PICQUE CAILLOU........--- 2.99 32.30
A superb Graves worth much more than this low price.
159 CHATEAU MAISON BLANCHE........-- 2.99 32.30

Our 1966 was recognized for its outstanding excellence
and was depleted very quickly. The ’67 has just arrivec.
If you are interested in truly fine wine at liveable cost,
please don’t overlook this one. St. Emilion.
