SABRA

From the land of the Bible
comes the liqueur of Israel,
SABRA. Its unique flavor rep-
resents a happy combination
of Jaffa oranges, subtly set off
by a hint of chocolate.

The decanter in which Sabra
come is an exact replica of an
ancient Palestinian work of art
—ideally suited as a holiday
gift, or for your own personal
drinking pleasure.

Traditionally, a bit of Sabra is
added to a cup of steaming
hot tea; or it can be enjoyed
on-the-rocks; 2 oz. of Sabra
with 1 oz. of lemon juice makes
an ideal Sour—or simply serve
it as is as an after dinner
liqueur.

BEEFEATER GIN

13A Rarely has any spirit cap-
tured the enthusiasm of
the American public “as 13B
has BEEFEATER ENG-
LISH GIN. Only two dec-
ades ago, the name was
primarily associated with
a beautifully uniformed
guard protecting the
Tower of London and
other historic monu-
ments. Now, should you
stop the nearest passer-
by ana ask him the
meaning of ‘Beefeater’,
he will respond with ‘the
best gin in the world’. We
suspect future dictionar-
ies will record this fact.
If you have a friend who
likes gin, can you think
of a better gift to send
him than a few bottles of
BEEFEATER?

Monks at a remote hide-
a-way in the French Alps.
Its virtues have been ex-
tolled through the ages.
