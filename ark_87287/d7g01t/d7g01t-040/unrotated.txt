DRY SACK

“Mop This famed ‘Sherry in the Sack” may

~ just well be the finest all-around Sherry
produced in Spain. Rich and nutty,
moderately dry, its taste never fails to
please. A wonderful idea for aperitifs
before lunch or dinner. Another excel-
lent way to savor Dry Sack? — as part
of a fireside supper of cheddar cheese
and apples. Who says we can’t learn a
thing or two from English gastronomy!

Available in both fifth and 37% oz.
bottles. Dry Sack in either size makes
an excellent present. But don’t forget
yourself.
