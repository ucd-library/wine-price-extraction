NATEAU de LACH

BEAUJOLAIS

Rich in fruit and charm, boundless in innocence—small wonder
Beaujolais is the most beloved red wine of France. These are
not wines to be guarded for drinking decades from now, rather
they are to be quaffed joyously during the first years of their
short lives. Presented ha is an interesting selection of recent
vintages from impeccable producers—among them, Chateau de
La Chaize, the 300 year old estate that may be the best single
source of this wonderful wine.

1976 VINTAGE

After the 1976 crop was gathered, there was joy in Beaujolais.
The wines are fruity, typical, and command eu prices
in many years. This 197 6 is bottled immediately after November
15th, or about two months after the harvest. ae Beaujolais de
Primeur listed below will be put on a fast boat and will be
delivered early December.

1975 VINTAGE

One must choose his 1975 Beaujolais carefully. Some of the
flatlands Beaujolais proved disappointing. Those on the hill-
sides — picked and bottled discriminately — proved excellent.
Listed below are prime examples of the ae of Beaujolais.

296 BEAUJOLAIS VILLAGES (Louis Jadot)... 3.98 43.94
A favorite among our clientele.
299 BROUILLY (Chateau de La Chaize)....... 3.99 44.50
This Brouilly 1975, estate-bottled at Chateau de
Ras) La Chaize, commemorates the ‘tricentenaire’ of
the Chateau—100 years older than our bicenten-
nial! Built in 1676, Chateau de La Chaize is con-
sidered by wine authorities to produce possibly
the best single example of fruity, well-balanced
red wine produced in the soil of Beaujolais. This
1975 has won a Gold Award at both Paris and
Macon as the best within its class. The Chateau
de La Chaize vineyard in the famed wine-grow-
ing district of Brouilly has been maintained
from father to son for three centuries by the
Marquis de Roussy de Sales family.

    

It has consistently been the best selling wine in
our history. Everybody loves it and come back
for more. Acquire this 1975 Tricentenaire Cuveé
for your own pleasure—or send it as a Christmas
gift to appreciative friends.
1198 BROUILLY (Chateau de La Chaize) in
‘TRICENTENAIRE’ MAGNUM ......... 9.95 56.60
case of six
Here is one of the most beautiful magnums we have ever
seen. To commemorate the vineyard’s ‘tricentenaire,’ a
limited edition of magnums, embossed in gold, have been
sent to the United States. They promise to be collector’s
items and can provide the most imaginative and impres-
sive of Christmas gifts. They are also packaged in a
handsome box holding three magnums. We can think of
no more exciting a wine gift at $29.85 than this gift box
of three.
93. BEAUJOLAIS VILLAGES (Louis Latour).. 4.25 45.90
The distinguished vinification of Louis Latour is ap-
parent here. Excellent.

1974 VINTAGE

A very large crop of pleasant,

a |

lively wines.

285 BEAUJOLAIS (Roussy de Sales).......... 2.99 34.10
The proprietor of Chateau de La Chaize makes a small
quantity of wine bearing only the name Beaujolais. Racy,
delicious, this is an excellent way to experience the
Marquis’ wine-making talent at a lower cost than his
noble Brouilly.

849 BEAUJOLAIS (Alexis Lichine)........... 3.39 36.61
Vigorous, endowed with much fruit and fragrance.
462 BEAUJOLAIS VILLAGES (Marquisat) .... 3.99 44.50

Light, fresh taste. Delicious.
