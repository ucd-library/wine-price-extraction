FINE CHAMPAGNE
V.S.0.P. COGNAC

Hennessy Is
synonymous with
Cognac for brandy
drinkers around the
globe. These wise
Cognac connoisseurs
have come to recog-
nize that every bottle
bearing the Hennessy
name contains an
outstanding, civilized
spirit—at very fair
price. We are dealing
here not with just any
Hennessy, but with
their glorious V.S.O.P.
Extra aging in
expensive white oak
barrels makes V.S.O.P.
so special. Rich,
smooth on the palate;
perfumed, concen-
trated to the nose. A
much appreciated
Christmas gift. In
handsome gift box.

ln 1970, Chateau Lafon
Rochet is a glory and
one of the great Grand
Cru vineyards of St. Esteé-
phe. In a blind tasting
held in Bordeaux, the
1970 Lafon-Rochet was
selected as a first choice
competing against such
exalted vineyards as
Montrose and Calon
Segur. Beautiful today, it
has at least a decade of
development to look for-
ward to. (80.89 the case)
