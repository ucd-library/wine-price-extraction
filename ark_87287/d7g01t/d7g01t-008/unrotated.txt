THE FAMED BALLANTINE SCOTCH

IN A DECANTER AT NO EXTRA CHARGE

Since 1934, the name BALLANTINE on a bottle
of Scotch whisky has represented distinction,
sophistication, and an elegant harmony of all
of the elements that are necessary to create a
soft, light, and beautifully balanced whisky. Its
popularity—particularly for Christmas gift-giv-
ing—has not faltered until this day.

In light of its excellence, the price is modest
enough. (97.47 case) 8.55

We herald the return of Ballantine Scotch in
decanter—particularly since there is no extra
charge for the decanter. Since the quantity
shipped is limited, we suggest you anticipate
your Scotch decanter gifts early.
