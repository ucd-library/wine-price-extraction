BRRARELY has any book on the subject of wine aroused quite

as much enthusiasm and interest on the part of the wine
drinker as this remarkable work by Frank Schoonmaker.
During a recent visit to America, Dr. Burklin-Wolf, President
of the German Estate-bottled Wine Producers, told us there
is nothing, even in the German language, as authoritative and
complete.

It was this book that spurred us on (a labor of love) to create
the list of Rhines and Moselles which appears in these pages —
the largest and most complete selection of authentic estate-
bottled (Original Abfullung) German wines that has ever
appeared anywhere in America.

The combination of the book, used jointly with this list, can
easily provide a great adventure in wine tasting. Most of these
wines are available by the bottle and we strongly encourage
your ordering them in this fashion so that you can taste one
against the other before embarking on case purchases. We can
think of no more intriguing tasting session than when you
compare from the same vineyard a ‘Spaetlese’ with an ‘Auslese’;
a 1953 with a 1955; or the same wine from two different
growers.

From these northernmost vineyards of the world (believe it
or not, even farther north than Labrador) come these exciting
Rhines and Moselles — wines that struggle to survive against
cold and frost — and when they do, produce what are undoubt-
edly the greatest white wines of the world. A fine 1953 cer-
tainly provides one of the most extraordinary white wine
experiences of our generation.

To pleasant reading and happy tasting!
