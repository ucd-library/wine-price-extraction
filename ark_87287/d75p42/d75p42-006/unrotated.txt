719 BOURGOGNE ROSE DE MARSANNAY 1966, Clair-Dau ................

We rarely indulge in superlatives. We are doing it now. We genuinely believe this is |
the best Vin Rose produced anywhere in the world. It is made of the noble Pinot seen
Noir grape grown on the best soil of Burgundy just north of Gevrey-Chambertin.

At last! A Vin Rosé with genuine character and flavor. |
