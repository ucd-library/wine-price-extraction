Most of you are familiar with
James Beard’s food and wine ac-
tivities, particularly his classic
books on cooking, his monthly
column in House & Garden, his
internationally famous cooking
school, and the consistent regard
and respect he has obtained
through the years from the food
editors of America.

Aware of Mr. Beard’s creative
imagination, and the sense of joy
with which he approaches the
Christmas dinner, we asked him
what he would like to serve at
Christmas IF PRICE WERE NOT
A FACTOR. The menu appears on
the front page of this brochure—
the step-by-step details of how to
proceed follow below.

The dinner will actually take
place in the home of Mr. & Mrs.
Lester Gruber in Detroit, with
James Beard not only acting as a
guest, but also Mr. Beard will join
Mr. and Mrs. Gruber in the kitchen
that morning to prepare the repast.
The manner in which they will pro-
ceed is described here.

“T enjoy the challenge of planning
my own Christmas dinner with no holds
barred. I went through an entire galaxy
of memorable dishes and reluctantly
had to relinquish many because, after
all, I was dealing with only one dinner.
Like a ship guided by the North Star,
I tried to move towards only the most
constant and most significant in my
memory. But, after all, each one has a
right to be independent in his menu
planning as he does in the choice of his
religion or his clothing. But not all will
agree with venison and oysters, but I
genuinely believe I will be pleasing the
majority of those who read these words.

“We start off in immodest fashion
with the very best caviar obtainable in
America. It is the Malossol Beluga of
the ‘21’ Club Reserve, which can be got-
ten from Iron Gate Products in New
York. Every egg is perfect, whole, of
the right color and sheer perfection. In-
cidently, Iron Gate Products is reigned
over by General Malcolm Beyer, who
has as his associates Bob Kriendler (a
Marine comrade) and Jerry Berns of
the ‘21’ Club. Gen. Beyer assures us that
this is the best caviar available any-

where in the world—it is not inexpen-
sive at $55 the pound, but worth it if
you do not want to ak ate tan»

when it comes to caviar what’s the point
of compromising! The good General
tells us that Iron Gate Products will de-
liver anywhere in the Manhattan area
at $55 the pound, properly packed for
keeping. For an extra $5.00 they will
send it air express anywhere in the
country and dressed in the appropriate
protective clothing to keep it perfect
when it arrives. The simplest way to get
it is to write Iron Gate Products, Inc.,
424 West 54th Street, or phone them at
757-2670. I suggest you ask for Miss
Williams who will handle your order
personally and give you special
attention.

“And what goes with the best caviar?
My opinion is simply good toast, butter
if you wish, and a touch of lemon—as
you can see, I am a purist. For those
who are willing to dilute and make the
caviar go further, of course the tradi-
tional thing to do is to add chopped
egg and onion. Many like to have Cham-
pagne with their caviar—but not me. I
prefer a great Russian Vodka such
as Stolichnaya or a superb Polish
Zubrowka, preferably frozen in ice
which adds gaiety to the scene and the
proper temperature to the drink. It is
easy to get that exciting look of clear
ice surrounding the bottle—all you
have to do is put the bottle in a con-
tainer, fill the container with water and
put it in the freezing compartment. The
Vodka and Zubrowka will not freeze,
but the water that surrounds them will
become a clear block. Get rid of the
container—and you have an exciting
way of serving the drink. And make
sure you do not put the neck of the
bottle into the water because you need
it as a handle for pouring. It will keep
cold for many hours and the Vodka
will taste much better than it does
usually.”

Editor’s Note: The Stolichnaya Vodka
is bottled in Moscow at 100 proof. The
Polish Zubrowka, which is basically
Vodka with Buffalo grass inserted giv-
ing it a greenish tinge, is also available.

“Generally speaking, the caviar and
Vodka scene will have taken place in
the living room. At this point, we are
ready, with our spirits properly cheered,

to enter the dining room and sit down
to a joyous Christmas dinner. The first
course will be Chincoteague Oysters
from the offshore islands of Maryland,
accompanied by the great Le Montrachet
1966 of Marquis de Laguiche—the Mal-
paque of Canada are now out of season
and the Belon of France are much too
hazardous to bring in by air. In my
opinion, the Chincoteagues are the best
available at this time of year. The Chin-
coteagues can be obtained at any good
fish dealer such as Wynne & Treanor on
the East Side. I suggest you order them
in advance before your dealer runs out.
Plan on 6 to 12 oysters per person, de-
pendent on the appetites of your guests,
the size of your serving plates and the
generosity of your purse. Simply serve
lemon wedges and the thinnest of rye
bread, with good sweet butter, as the
oyster accompaniment. This simple ap-
proach, rather than dousing the oysters
in sauce, will bring out, in most dra-
matic fashion, the great white wine—
Le Montrachet of Marquis de Laguiche
1966.

“The total production of Laguiche
Montrachet is only 300 cases a year
and the 1966 is probably the best Mont-
rachet the good Marquis has produced
in a decade. It is a dramatically great
wine and so great with oysters.”

Editor’s Note: Sherry’s share of La-
guiche Montrachet 1966 is only a few
cases. We urge ordering it early. It costs
$13.68 the bottle, but is worth it. If you
want a great wine that is not quite as
costly, we strongly endorse the Batard
Montrachet 1964 of Ramonet at $6.99
the bottle.
