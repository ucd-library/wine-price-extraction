IREE STAR RUM (From Haiti) 5. oS 68.18 | O° g
Haiti they have arum called Barbancourt, made

not from molasses - but from the pure juice of sugar
cane. Connoisseurs of fine rum consider this the
best rum produced anywhere in the Caribbean area
For ahsoet 1 L00 years this rum has been distilled as ee

Cognac. If you are not familiar with Barbancourt. we

a vast improvement in your rum drinks

ION" BONDED KENTUCKY BOURBON 6.99 81.50 ee
ne a, one of the few remaining examples of

choice pre-war Kentucky Bourbon, was originally
led in 1942 and then bottled eight years later in

 

1950. It was made only of the finest grains ata small,
top-flight distillery and allowed to mature under ideal

conditions. We consider this collector's item one of
verfect bourbons we have ever tasted
