POMMERY & GRENO RESERVE RAINIER III BRUT

Brut that was served at the fairy tale wedding, in
Monaco, between Prince Rainier III and Grace
Kelly. It is the proud product of the best bottles
that existed in the extraordinary cellars of
Pommery & Greno. This full flavored, perfectly
balanced and bone dry wine has delighted many
of our friends who have experienced it during

the last several months. Undoubtedly, this is
the most unusual opportunity to acquire out-
standing Champagne at modest cost that has Pant as
been offered the New York public in years. ae ae Aeon ee
