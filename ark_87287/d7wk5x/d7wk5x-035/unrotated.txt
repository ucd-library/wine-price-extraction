   

of FRANCE

MONSIEUR MONNOT, in our considered
opinion, in his extremely small way, is unsur-
passed and possibly unequalled among the
white wine producers of France. His total pro-
duction of white Burgundy rarely exceeds ten
small barrels, or 250 cases in all. The wines
that carry his label are treasures indeed, with
an extraordinary wealth of bouquet and flavor,
powerful, and entirely remarkable.

We spent an entire afternoon in his tiny cellar,
just big enough to hold the ten small barrels,
ae were astonished by the fabulous quality
of what we tasted. His 1954s were superb, much
beyond the class of anything else we found
amoung the white Burgundies, and his 1955s
can only be described as fantastically great.

We happily report that most of his production
are now in our cellars to bring their magnifi-
cence to our clientele. We urge that you try
them — both 1954 and 1955 alike — if you are
interested in the best white wine of France.

It was at Arbois that Pasteur pursued his experiments with
fermentation. The Pasteur vineyard is now owned by
Henri Maire, the producer of this extraordinary Vin Rose.

BEAUJOLAIS ROSE 1953

At the Domaine des Tours, they follow the practice of
bottling a small amount of Rose for their personal use.
When at the vineyard we tasted it, and persuaded them
to send us a small annual shipment. Undoubtedly, pink
wine of France at its absolute best.
