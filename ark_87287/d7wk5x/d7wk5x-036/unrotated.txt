Mirabelle
Kirsch «“« Framboisel

It is generally acknowledged that the best small distiller in Alsace is Alfred
Hess. It is his ‘alcools blancs’ that are served in the great restaurants of Franee,
such as the Restaurant de la Pyramide (Point) and Hotel de la Cote @Or
(Dumaine).

Monsieur Hess lives southwest of Strasbourg at the foot of the Vosges Moun-
tains, in a zone famous for its fruit, both cultivated (the plums called Quetschs
and Mirabelles) and wild (the wild cherries for Kirsch and the wild raspberries
for Framboise). Although principally known for his fruit brandies, Monsieur
Hess is also an important vineyard owner, a great sportsman, and a much
decorated wartime chief of the Alsatian resistance movement.

Only after several years of negotiations, was he finally persuaded to ship us
a small quantity of his precious bottles, the best eaux-de-vie of all Alsace.
Often served chilled, remarkable for their bouquet, these are among the most
interesting and delightful of after dinner brandies — as such, perhaps the most
highly regarded rivals of fine Cognac.

Bottle

QUETSCH)....... 5.90

The distillery of Monsieur Hess never exceeds more than 600 cases of all his Eaux-
de-Vie combined in any one year. Just outside his distillery is his own orchard from
whence comes the small purple plums out of which this remarkable Quetsch is made

MIRABELLE)........................

9.700

Remarkable for its bouquet, this extraordinary fruit brandy is made from little yellow
plums, largely from his own orchard, but he does buy some from neighboring farmers.

ReMGCM il. o

The wild cherries from which this Kirsch is made must be gathered at an altitude
above 1000 feet in order to achieve the proper flavor. The ordinary commercial
Kirsch bears no comparison. Botile

FRAMBOISE............ fo.go

We often hear stories of the remarkable Framboise that was found in the home of the
Mavor or local Curé of one of the small towns in Alsace. Candidly, no matter how
remote the source, we doubt any are the equal of this one. Mr. Hess’s truck and men
ascend the mountains to an altitude well beyond 1500 feet to pick the wild raspberries.
Usually, at the end of the day, they do not come down to the distillery with more
than 100 pounds of this precious, elusive fruit. It takes 15 pounds to make one bottle
of Framboise.
