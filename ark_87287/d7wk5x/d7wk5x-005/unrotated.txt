We have searched long and hard
for a pleasing red and white
wine to sell under $1.00 the bot-
tle. We know of no more pleas-
ing examples available than the
red and white Bordeaux of Boyer
Freres.

RED WINES
BORDEAUX ROUGE 1953, Boyer Freres

No ordinary regional wine this! An authentic 1953 from
Bordeaux’s most important firm. Price has moved up sub-
stantially in Bordeaux since acquisition because of 1953
depletion and frost damage.

CHIANTI, Buzzoni (Quart Wicker )

A pleasant red table wine from Tuscany—in the traditional,
colorful, wicker bottle at a cost of only 3¢ the fluid ounce.

WHITE WINE
BORDEAUX BLANC 1953, Boyer Freres

A distinguished counterpart to the Bordeaux Rouge de-
scribed medium dry, pleasant and full of fruit.
From an impeccable shipper.

RED WINES
BEAUJOLAIS 1955, Domaine du Ringuet

Our best-seller among our red wines and for good reason
we quote the review this wine received in the New
York Times, January 29th, “then there is a Beaujolais that
is all a Beaujolais should be, but alas, seldom in this
country — purplish-red, with the fruity aroma and taste
of crushed grapes. In our opinion, a true discovery for
those who want true Beaujolais at a modest price.” :

ished Chateau bottled Claret. A real beauty.
