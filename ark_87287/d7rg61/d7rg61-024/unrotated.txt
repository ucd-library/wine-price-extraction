We quote the wonderful, newly-published Alexis Lichine's
Guide to the Wines and Vineyards of France, "The Cotes du
Roussillon have a number of hillside villages with distinc-
tive microclimates, which may label their wines as Cotes du
Roussillon-Villages. Worth noting are Caramany ... and the
Vignerons Catalans who have taken the lead in producing the
region's finest wines." Here is the best one of all - its
excellence will suprise and delight you: Due July.

SAUVIGNON BLANC 1978, Troisgros de Roanne
Jean Troisgros, one of France's great chefs,
sent us a sample of this '78 grown not far from Poitiers,

south of the Loire. Though it is featured at his famed Roanne
restaurant, we were still skeptical - but upon tasting it, ordered

400 cases. Here is aperfect everyday dry white wine. August arrival.

CAHORS 1977, Comte de Monpezat

A hundred miles east of Bordeaux, there is
Cahors - an area Frank Schoonmaker described as producing

unmistakable distinction." This 1977 was produced by Comte de Monpezat
whose son is now the\proud husband of the Queen of Denmark. Due August.
