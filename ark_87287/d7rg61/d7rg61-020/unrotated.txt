hed Wines of Spain

No. Bottle Case
If one compares the wines of California produced today with those made a decade
ago, the reaction would be "a miracle has been wrought" - the growth in quality
is nothing short of astonishing. Some have achieved the levels of the best of
Europe. Perhaps not so dramatically, the same is true of the wines of Spain.
They are infinitely better than they were in the past, thanks to their ever-
expanding knowledge, dedication and government regulation. Some of the best
buys in red wine that exist anywhere on the globe can be found among the vine-
yards of northern Spain - particularly those in Rioja. Choose among them.
