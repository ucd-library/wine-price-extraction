be presumptuous to claim to know the answer now. But we do not

rule out the possibility that in 1985, knowledgeable wine drinkers

will write epic poetry about the ‘71s - and speak in a more minor

of our wise salesmen bought two cases

believe in the future. We believe they

made a good investment - shouldn't you?

CHATEAU TALBOT (St. Julien) 15,95
Our associate Sam Aaron visited Jean Cordier, the
proprietor of Chateau Talbot, in March. After tasting

the '71 vintage, both agreed it may not be as dramatic

as the '70 - but may possibly surpass it in the long run.

CHATEAU GRUAUD LAROSE (St. Julien) 15.95
M. Cordier also owns Gruaud, which is classified as
a Second Growth, and is the 'big brother’ of Talbot.

CHATEAU DUCRU BEAUCAILLOU (St. Julien) 12.49 144.00
Ducru iS a winner - one of the greats.

CHATEAU HAUT-BRION (Graves) 29.95 342.00
We salute Jean Delmas - the man who made this noble,
classic, great red wine. Will thrive better with each passing year.

CHATEAU MOUTON-ROTHSCHILD (Pauillac) 32.49 aee. UV
Andy Warhol designed the label for the '75 vintage,

Pablo Picasso for the '73 vintage. This 1971 proudly

bears the artistry of Kandinsky.

CHATEAU LATOUR (Pauillac) 32.49 372.00
There is an inner, deep, concentrated darkness in

the heart of a bottle of Latour 1971 - a quality that
indicates a long, brilliant future.

CHATEAU LAFITE-ROTHSCHILD 34.95 397 .00

In April, we attended an extraordinary

tasting of 17 various vintages of Lafite-

1970 VINTAGE - No one questions the greatness, tne future lifespan, o

harmonious balance of the 1970 vintage, already established a
one of the 'greats' of our lifetime. However, every alert wi
merchant does question his ability to acquire any of the ‘70s
at all. Only the smallest quantities remain. Should you want
any for the future, now is the time to acquire them.

CHATEAU LAFITE-ROTHSCHILD (Pauillac)

Lafite '61 now fetches over $2,000 the case. Will
this happen to this '70 a decade hence? Most likely.

CHATEAU PETRUS 49.9
(Pomerol )

The most dramatic, hardest-to-obtain,

and most amazing red wine in the comtemporary
history of Bordeaux. Why? Quantity produced,
absurdly low - world demand, overwhelming -
quality of the wine - incredible!

CHATEAU MOUTON-ROTHSCHILD (Pauillac) 49.95 569.00
We are in the presence of greatness. Baron Philippe
de Rothschild deserves a 'Medaille d'Or' for what he achieved in 1970.
