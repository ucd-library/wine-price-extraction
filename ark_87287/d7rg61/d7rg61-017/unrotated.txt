Wines of Italy

We are enthusiastic about the excellence - and value - of the wines produced in
Italy - a feeling shared by Robert Finigan who states in his Private Guide to

Wine, "Even if you know Chianti and the familiar trinity of Barolo, Barbaresco
and Barbera, there must be dozens of Italian appellations totally unfamiliar to

you.

No.

I'm discovering new ones every week!...exciting finds by any standards."
