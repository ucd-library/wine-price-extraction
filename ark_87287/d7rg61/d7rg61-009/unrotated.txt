Red Burgundy

1976 VINTAGE - A great, magnificent year. Full-bodied, long-lived. Only

microscopic quantities remain at the Burgundian vineyards,
thus making them extremely rare, hard to come by, - and
expensive. Based on replacement, the '76s listed below sel]
for considerably higher prices. Now is the time to buy them,
while our low, early-acquisition prices are still available.
