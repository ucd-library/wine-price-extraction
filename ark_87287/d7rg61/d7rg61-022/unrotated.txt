Bottle Case

The California wine boom has had an important reverberation. Creative winemakers
are moving south of San Francisco in increasing numbers, attracted by conditions
for producing top-quality wine that may prove as good as anywhere in California.

Old vineyards in the Salinas Valley are being replanted with prime varietals,

and some of its rocky slopes are flourishing with vines for the first time ever.
There are pockets of magnificent vineyard soil even further south undergoing this
exciting transformation. Quality winemaking is no longer limited to the north.

CALERA WINE COMPANY - This 1975 Zinfandel - California's own varietal - is grown
in the Cienega district, and is exceptionally good.

CALLAWAY VINEYARDS - Eli Callaway, former President of Burlington Industries,
discovered a perfect microclimate in the hills near San Diego. His whites

Wines of Our Native Soil

No. NEW YORK AND WASHINGTON Bottle Case

Wine lovers sometimes have the impression that top-flight American wines are a
monopoly of California. Not so. Excellent wines are being made in many corners
of the U.S. by winemakers every bit as dedicated and innovative as those in Napa
and Sonoma. New York and Washington have particularly made their marks.

BENMARL_ VINEYARDS - The Hudson Valley in New York is one of the most promising
vineyard areas in the East - and the wines made by Mark Miller here at
the Benmarl Vineyards are the proof.

CHATEAU STE. MICHELLE - Did you know that the state of Washington ranks third in
the United States in grape production? Only a tiny percentage is turned
into premium wines, and of that, the very best is Chateau Ste. Michelle.

CLINTON VINEYARDS - This elegant, dry, well-balanced, estate-
bottled wine comes from Ben Feder's own small vineyard
near Clinton Corners. One of the best white wines ever
made in New York - comparable in style and quality to
a first-rate Loire. Production is tiny, so we urge you
to acquire some soon. Its praises are already sung.
