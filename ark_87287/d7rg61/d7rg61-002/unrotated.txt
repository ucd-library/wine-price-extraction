Red Bordeaux

1976 VINTAGE - 1975 was, in everyone's estimation, a great Bordeaux vintage.

As for 1976, we quote Robert Finigan's Private Guide to Wines,
"The '76s are fruity, soft and charming, rather like the '/3s
but with considerably more structure and character .... They
will be perfect choices for enjoyment while the much more

 

grandly proportioned 1975s mature." Excellent wines - and values!

We at Sherry-Lehmann, now know how an art dealer feels when he has but one
Picasso, Renoir or Matisse to sell. The price is high- but the acquisition
represents a rare experience. Each signed bottle bears a special label with
the date of signing and the bottle number from the total of that series.

When these bottles are gone, there will be no more. Both the wine and the
art represent the great heights which can perhaps occur only once in a life-
time. In extremely limited supply, we suggest your ordering promptly.
