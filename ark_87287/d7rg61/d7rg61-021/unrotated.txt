Wires of Oar Native

It's an exciting time to be a winemaker in California. The last decade has seen
the establishment of dozens of new, generally small wineries that began releas-

ing incredibl ood wines from almost the moment they opened. The older, larger
wineries, too, have enthusiastically joined the move toward top-flight varietals.

 

hoe SONOMA VALLEY Bottle Case

Extending northward from San Francisco Bay, are some of the oldest - and newest -
wineries in California. The wines listed below come from the choicest vineyard
acreage of Sonoma (called 'Valley of the Moon' by the Indians); Alexander Valley

(whose climate is similar to that of Burgundy); and lands along the Russian River.

CHATEAU ST. JEAN - At the renowned Four Seasons' Barrel Tasting last March, a
distinguished California winemaker savored a glass of Richard Arrowood's
late-harvest Riesling, paused, and then remarked, "I hope you all realize
how hard it is to make a wine like this." The praise was apt- and applies
equally well to all of the superb wines produced at Chateau St. Jean.
