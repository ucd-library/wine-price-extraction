TUK WIXK ERERS

THE CELLAR

by Samuel Aaron

I have just returned from a wine tour which cov-
ered, in fairly complete fashion, the most important
vineyards of Bordeaux, the Loire, the Rhone Valley,
Burgundy, Alsace, Champagne and the most im-
portant wine-growing districts of Germany.

On a trip of this kind, it is not uncommon to
visit more than 10 vineyards in a day and average
over 100 different wines. To accomplish my mission
within the prescribed time, I generally started tast-
ing before 9 o’clock in the morning and usually did
not leave the last vineyard of the day until well after
7 o’clock in the evening.

One of the pleasantest occupations known to man
is that of tasting wines at the vineyard. Somehow,
the ancient art acquires new dignity when it is done
in a cool, dark cellar surrounded by barrels. The
vineyard at which the grapes are grown is generally
but a-stone’s throw from the cellars and the man
who grew the grapes is standing by, making com-
ments as you taste. The proximity of nature’s
bounty and man’s art, so close at hand, in some
mysterious way affects the whole process; the wine
experience becomes more intriguing; even the taste
buds seem to become more sensitive and acute.

It is important to remember that wine is like a
living thing, subject to many influences such as eare,
temperature, etc. A Chateau Mouton Rothschild
1949, stored in New Orleans, is ready to drink
today, due to the warm temperature in which it has
been resting. The same wine in the cellars of the
Chateau, never having experienced an ocean

voyage, or temperature change, is still in its earlier
stages of development and will not be ready for
drinking for at least another year or two.

When tasting in the vineyard cellars, it is usually
necessary to sometimes taste 10 different barrels
of the same wine, grown from grapes in the same
fields, to determine which barrel is the best. Each
has its subtle difference which may reflect an earlier
‘cuvee’ (or picking), or a bad stave in the barrel,
or perhaps an overdose of sulphur in the wood.

The differences among barrels is revealed in most
dramatic fashion at the annual German wine
auction where the best connoisseurs of the country
bid for the wine barrel by barrel. There are in-
stances where a cask of Berncasteler Doctor will
fetch a price triple that of its adjacent barrel in
the same cellar—all from the same vineyard.

The Einstein Theory of Relativity also influences
the thinking of the wine taster: the standard can
never be absolute. Each wine must be judged in
terms of the district in which it’s grown, its poten-
tial within its own class, and the purpose for which
that particular wine is generally employed. Obvi-
ously, it would be less than fair to expect a red
wine that is suited for everyday drinking, such as
Beaujolais, to compete with a classic example of
Claret such as Chateau Lafite Rothschild 1947.
After all, it is hardly recommended that caviar be
served with every meal. It must always be borne in
mind that each wine, like food, has its own place
and offers its own particular satisfaction.
