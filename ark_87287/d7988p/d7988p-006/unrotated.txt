1988 PARK & TILFORD PRIVATE STOCK IN COCKTAIL SHAKER ccc 5.25 59.85
a We like being the first to tell you about an interesting new item — a

handsome, useful cocktail shaker holding the fine Park & Tilford’s

Private Stock whiskey. And, best of all, there is no added cost for the

cocktail shaker even though our scouts tell us that any gift shop would

price it for at least $3.00. The whiskey is outstanding and has been a

perennial favorite in the United States for over two decades. It is a

blend consisting only of mature, old whiskies — no neutral spirits. We

or 0g will like the product and the cocktail shaker as an extra

Ividend.
