211 — BEAUJOLAIS 1955

In France, they like to drink their Beau-
jolais young and fresh — here is a simple
‘vin ordinaire’ that can be found in many

a country inn of the Burgundian country-
side. It does not pretend to great stature,

an outstanding value.

The best red wine of the Cote de Beaune

179 — POMMARD EPENOTS 1953

Pommard is the best known of all Bur-
gundies — Epenots is the best vineyard.

from the dubious Pommard that floods the
market.

217 — BEAUJOLAIS BROUILLY 1953

We remember fondly our visit to Chateau
des Tours in the town of Brouilly where
this superb Beaujolais was born. It is
estate bottled, of top flight vintage year,
and has all of the fruit and warmth asso-
ciated with Beaujolais at its best. The neck
label proudly boasts of the Grand Award

it received at the Paris Fair.

There is an old French saying ~ “You can-
not be gay without drinking Volnay”’. The
wine is pleasant, of flowery bouquet, and
outstanding balance. A beautiful estate-
bottled example from a topflight vineyard.

292 — BONNES MARES 1953

A Burgundian treasure that is second to
none — the entire vineyard is only 34 acres
and Claire Dau is one of the important
proprietors. A dramatic wine experience
for those who like great red Burgundy.

250 — FIXIN, CLOS CHAPITRE 1953

Pierre Gelin is one of the best wine makers
we ever met. This superb wine, grown not
far from Chambertin is, in our opinion,
the best value in truly great Burgundy we

have run across.

234 — VOSNE ROMANEE 1953

The wines of Vosne Romanee are the hard-
est to obtain and the most expensive red
wines on earth. One English wine author-
ity referred to them as ‘the mingling of
velvet and satin in the bottle .

 

273 — CLOS VOUGEOT 1953

The largest and the most famous of all
Burgundy. M. Moillard showed us his sec-
tion of the vineyard, which is dead center
and one of the choicest parts of Clos
Vougeot. A great wine. Only 32 cases.
