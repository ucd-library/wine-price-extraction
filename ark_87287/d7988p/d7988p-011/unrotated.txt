  

NINE TASTING EXPERIENCES AMONG THE WHITE BURGUNDIES

These wines were picked carefully ~ each is a worthy representative of the vineyard from whence it comes. Now that
1956 has definitely been declared a failure, the owners now part with their 52s, 53s and 55s only under the greatest
persuasion and at considerably higher prices. Our advice is to acquire these now before the higher costs will be reflected.

317 — POUILLY VINZELLES 1953

An important discovery to those who like
dry white wine of finesse and fruit ~ a

399 — CHABLIS 1953

1953 was extraordinary in Chablis — a
devastating frost struck the vineyards in
Spring and less than 20% of a normal crop
was produced. The survivors were out-
standing. This is an authentic example.

356 — AN OUTSTANDING 1953

The Montrachets are the greatest of all
white Burgundies, and the Bienvenue is
one of the best vineyards, Sauzet is a
superb wine maker and his 1953 has the
unmistakable flavor; dryness without
harshness; floweriness without sweetness.

347 — MEURSAULT 1953

comes from one of the top vineyards

333 — MONTRACHET 1953

The ‘ne plus ultra’ of all French white

wines is le Montrachet itself — as herd to
acquire as Romanee Conti. Only 1& irre-
placeable cases remain.
