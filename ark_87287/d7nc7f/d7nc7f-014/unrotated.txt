Rhéne. Domaine de Riviére les Bas.

GAHORS {Gaves dO]... 1.99 22.50
Of late, we have been reading that experts consider
Cahors, the black wine from the high country, as the
best value of red wine in all of France. Certainly, Frank
Schoonmaker agrees when he states, “Slow maturing,
remarkably long-lived, firm, but not harsh, it has un-
mistakable distinction of its own... those interested in
wine and ‘discoveries’ will do well to seek it out.” It
sold for $3.75 only a while ago and we offer it to you
proudly at $1.99. This non-vintage is a blend of several
years—for those who want a more distinctive, longer-
lived version, we suggest the Cahors 1970 listed below.

VILLAUDRIC ROUGE 1973.............. 2.39 25.90
Grown in southwest France, in the Tarn-et-Garonne area.

vigorous.
