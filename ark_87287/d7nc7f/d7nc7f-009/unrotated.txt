RED BURGUNDY

Among recent vintages, ‘1970’ was the ‘star’ in Bordeaux; the
‘1969’ took the center of the stage in Burgundy—to be followed
by an even greater ‘star’ 1971, a year which some claim to
be the best vintage for red Burgundy since 1929.

It must be remembered that the great vineyards of the Céte
d’Or produce but a small fraction of the quantity yielded by
the chateaux in Bordeaux. This was particularly true of the
‘69s and ’71s, years that produced superb quality but pitiably
low quantity. The result was predictable. The prices for the
great names of Burgundy are now approaching the high levels
achieved by the famed vineyards of Bordeaux, and there is no
sign that they will come down in the immediate future.

We happily report that we bring you some of the great gems
of 1971 and 1969. Choose among them now—while a full selec-
tion is available—for surely most of them will be gone before
the end of the year and they are irreplaceable.

1971 RED BURGUNDIES

No. Bottle Case

er a 4.29 46.35
Don’t let the modest appellation which only indicates
the grape variety discourage you. In truth, we are deal-
ing with an excellent estate-bottling by Quillardet, pro-
duced skillfully on some of the better soil of the Cote
d’Or. If you are interested in what is in the bottle, and
not so much in what is on the label, here is a ‘best buy.’
Accidentally, the grower neglected to affix the vintage
label, but it is actually 1971.

1969 VINTAGE

We know of no better way of testifying to the true excellence
of the 1969 red Burgundies than to simply quote Frank
Schoonmaker’s recently issued Vintage Report, “1969 is an
exceedingly great year in Burgundy, quite in the class with
fabulous 1961... deep-colored, rich, everything that fine Bur-
gundies should be...a few conceivably even 20/20, which is
as high as I can go.” We know of no more persuasive statement
to justify anticipating your future requirements than the ob-
jective evaluation by Mr. Schoonmaker—an opinion shared
unanimously by the Burgundy wine growers’ community.

252 PINOT NOIR DE MARSANNAY.......... 4.49 48.50

Burgundian soil. Noble Pinot Noir flavor emerges,

known great red wine. Estate-bottled, René Roy.

oor OeNEROMANEE 5... 8.99 97.10
Despite its small size, Vosne-Romanée is the most re-
markable and famed of the wine producing communes

apex of excellence during the 1969 vintage.

excellence.

>) JOS DEVOUCEOT.....- 2. 12.50 135.00

Sey ll 26.50 286.20
Comte de Vogue generously sent us a few cases of his
utterly remarkable and dramatic Musigny, a wine that
can take on the best of Chambertins and Romanées. A
true collectors’ item—only 6 cases.

1966 VINTAGE

fragrance, fruit and superb balance. Shows remarkable promise

passed by 1961.
