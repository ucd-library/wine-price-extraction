RED BURGUNDIES

Here are a few rare survivors of famed vintage years of pre-
vious decades. Because of their small size, Burgundy growers
cannot hold on to previous vintages in the same manner that
it can be achieved in the large estates of Bordeaux. AS a con-
sequence, they are hard to come by and are much appreciated
by those wine aficionados who love fine old red Burgundy.
Here are a few remarkable examples that we are fortunate
enough to be able to offer you.

No. Bottle Case
325 CORTON MARECHAUDES 1962......... 7.95 85.85
Prince de Merode, the most important owner of Corton,

is particularly proud of his 1962 Marchaudes. Only a few
cases remain.

413 ROMANEE ST. VIVANT 1965............ 12.25 132.50
A blessed vineyard, next to Romanée-Conti, and now
produced by Domaine de la Romanée-Conti. Relatively
light, but the blessedness of the soil comes through with
distinction and clarity.

382 BEAUNE CHAMPINOTS 1961............ 17.95 193.85
Joseph Drouhin has been kind to our clientele and to us.
After continuous requests on our part for some of his
1961 reserves, which we have tasted, they finally con-

sented to send us a few cases. Here is red Burgundy at
its best.

907 CLOS DE VOUGEOT i952...........__. 22.50 243.00
1952 was endowed in Burgundy with great longevity,

This wine is vigorous today. From the cellars of Paul
Bouchard.

$48 CHAMBOLLE-MUSIGNY, CHARMES
TOBE te 34.50 372.60
The pride of the Hotel de la Poste cellars is this remark-
able 1934 which will impress you with its lively quality,
balance, and bouquet. A collector’s item.

   

EAUX-DE-VIE

The beloved clear white brandies of France can bring a special
quality to climax the summer dinner party, particularly when
served icy cold. The very appearance of the frosted glass will
bring delight to the eyes of the beholder. The taste captures,
in flight, the fruit of the pear, cherry, plum and wild raspberry.
One bottle will go a long way—because 1 oz. in a frosty wine
glass will bring lingering pleasure as your guests joyously im-
bibe the bouquet.

A-1 PEAR BRANDY (Niece). 14.96
Manguin produces pears on his island in the middle of
the Rhéne River that are shipped to the three-star res-
taurants of France. Each year, he reserves a small quan-
tity for distillation, producing the best pear brandy of
Europe. Remarkable.

A-2 MIRABEELE (Alsacé) = 3 6 422 4. ce 17.96
Jean Danflou owns the amazing boutique on Rue Thabor,
which is the shrine to the Paris gourmets who love fine
distillates. Made from little yellow plums found in the
exceptional orchards south of Strasbourg.

A-3 KIRSCH (Alsace) .. . cde sR Ee seme so oan oa 17.96
A pure distillate of macerated cherries—because of in-
tense flavor, one bottle will go far. From Alfred Hess.

A-4 “FRAMBOISE [Alsace] = 17.96
Another example of great Eaux-de-Vie discovered by
Jean Danflou. Made of wild raspberries gathered at high
altitude in the Vosges Mountains. It takes 15 quarts of
slowly picked wild raspberries to produce a single
bottle. Remarkable. Quantity limited.

 
 

CAREFREE WINES
FROM EVERYWHERE

WINE pre-dates recorded history and is grown almost every-
where. If you are looking for the great wines of the world you
will not find them below. However, you will find—in an age of
spiralling wine prices—several good, satisfying examples that
will not make too serious a dent in the family budget. Some of
these will represent previously untried journeys into wine
drinking—an Odyssey worth undertaking, particularly in the
Summer when there is freedom and leisure to move into the
by-paths of the wine world. These wines are not endowed with

fame and recognition—but each will have its own personal
message.

1325 NORMANDY APPLE CIDER (France)..... 1.39 15.12
Medium sweet, rich in apple taste, delicious as a summer
drink. Relatively low in alcohol.

845 HAMBLEDON WHITE 1969 (England).... 1.99 22.50
In British soil, Maj. Sir Guy Salisbury-Jones has suc-
ceeded in producing a rare, elegant dry white wine simi-
lar to a good Moselle. Try it—you will be amazed.

662° RIOJA 1971 (Spain) 1.99 22.50
Rioja produces the best red wine of Spain. Endowed with
earthy lustiness, honesty, and depth of flavor. This ex-
cellent example, from the outstanding firm of Bodegas
Riojanas will give you drinking satisfaction at low mod-
est sale cost.

917. VELTINSKE WHITE (Czechoslovakia).... 2.25 24.50

1281 CABERNET SAUVIGNON 1970 (Israel).... 2.49 26.90
Baron de Rothschild was proud of the red wine he pro-
duced from the Cabernet Sauvignon grape in Bordeaux.
He sent vine cuttings to the Carmel wine growers at
Richon Le Zion. The happy result is this wine proving
that the noblest of the red wine grapes can produce a
wine of distinction in the relatively warmer climate of
Israel. Certainly, this is far and away the best red wine
we have ever tasted from this country.

967 CABERNET ISTRIA 1969 (Yugoslavia).... 2.59 27.97
Full-bodied, deep colored earthy red wine—like a good
red Bordeaux. Astonishing excellence and value.

198 LOIBENER KAISERWEIN (Austria)...... 2.59 29.85
This was the favorite dry white wine of Emperor Franz

slightly sweet with a well-rounded flavor.”

800 VERMONT APPLE WINE (Vermont)...... 2.99 32.30
Though made from apples, it tastes more like a Macon
Blanc than it does a cider. Truly excellent. Will intrigue
you. New England can be proud of what they have pro-
duced here.

467 TOKAY SZAMARODNI DRY
in 46 oz. bottle (Hungary),........... 3.19 34.45
From the Carpathian Mountains of northeastern Hungary.

dry.

light, white dry version. Similar in style to a Vinho Verde.
