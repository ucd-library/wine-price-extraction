FOR THOSE INTERESTED IN ACQUIRING THE BEST OF
THE ESTATE-BOTTLED 1970 RHINES AND MOSELLES

In today’s soaring wine market, these are by far the best
white wine values presently available. All are from the pres-
tigious 1970 vintage—a year that gave us a bounty of de-
lightful, light, elegant Rhine and Moselle wines which have
matured beautifully and are just coming into their own.

This offering is limited to only the great vineyards and out-
Standing estate bottlers. It is also of economic interest to
note below the prices at which these wines sold for last
month—and even those quotations had not yet reflected
the upward price tendencies that these great vineyards
now command on the world market.

At $34.50 the case, anyone interested in enjoying outstand-
ing Rhines and Moselles during the next year or two, simply
cannot ignore this unique opportunity. In many instances,
the prices are lower than those that Presently prevail in
Germany. Quantity limited and subject to prior sale. We
Suggest you anticipate your future requirements promptly
to avoid disappointment due to early depletion.
