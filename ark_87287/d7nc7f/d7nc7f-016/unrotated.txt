To put it all in perspective, California produces over 75% of
the wine consumed in the United States—about 15% coming
from foreign countries—and the remaining 10% comes from
other states, chiefly New York. It should also be remembered
that California’s wine is made almost exclusively from Euro-
pean grape varieties and bear a taste similarity to the wines of
the Continent. All other wines made in the United States come
either from native American grapes, or from hybrids.

We have just returned from an intensive visit to the better
vineyards of northern California and were astonished and de-
lighted by what we observed and tasted. Though we have not
yet achieved a Chateau Lafite Rothschild or a Musigny, we
are well on our way. American wines have come of age and
they are to be taken seriously even by the most discriminating
wine drinker, whether he be a Frenchman, a German, or an
American.

It also became apparent that our gallon jug wine is considerably
better than the Vin Ordinaire the average Frenchman drinks
daily. If you are skeptical, we suggest you browse through the
listings of America’s best wines that appear below, choose
among them, and enjoy a true adventure in wine tasting.

SONOMA VINEYARDS

Knowledgeable wine drinkers, who have spent time in northern
California recently, bring back the word of the amazing devel-
opments taking place at the SONOMA VINEYARDS under the
capable dedication and expertise of founder and winemaker,
Rodney Strong. Mr. Strong has now planted over 5,000 acres
of superb vineyard land in Sonoma County and on these acres
he concentrates on the superior varietal grapes of California.

NAPA VALLEY

Rich in wine history and tradition, Napa Valley has more fine
vineyards per square mile than any other area in the U‘S. It
is narrow, only 35 miles in length, and is dominated by the
1,800 foot summit of Mt. St. Helena at its northern end. As in
Bordeaux, the vineyard names have become familiar landmarks
to the wine lover.

CHRISTIAN BROTHERS

Christian Brothers is a Catholic order originally founded in
France in 1700. Possibly, its birthplace may explain its devotion
to wine-making. Brother Timothy, one of the world’s most
knowledgeable wine authorities, is responsible for the wine.

ROBERT MONDAVI

The Mondavi family has owned the Charles Krug vineyard in
Napa for many years. Robert Mondavi thought he could do
better and several years ago started a vineyard on his own, a
few miles away. We have tasted the wines produced at the
Mondavi vineyard, and in our opinion, they are not only out-
standing today, but are endowed with a brilliant future.
