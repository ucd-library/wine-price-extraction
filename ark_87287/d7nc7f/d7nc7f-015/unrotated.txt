ITALIAN WINES

Many wine drinkers are now turning to Italy to provide good
wine at modest cost. We have taken the challenge seriously,
and have searched out the best that Italy has to offer. We
particularly commend the litres and double-litres as among the
best values in good red and white wine for the money—the
Ghemme, for a glorious, big red—and the Soave, for your daily
warm weather wine.

SHERRIES FROM SPAIN

‘Sherry-on-the-Rocks’ has now become in vogue on the conti-
nent. This habit is now being adopted in America—particularly
by those who prefer an aperitif of lower alcoholic content,
especially during the Summer.
