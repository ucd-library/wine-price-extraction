Written as the 1964 GRAPES are being gathered

with additional comments on new wines, food and

restaurant discoveries in LONDON and PARIS

EDITOR’S NOTE—James Beard, wine con-
sultant to House and Garden has often been
referred to by the press as “King of the
American food experts.” His recently pub-
lished book of autobiographical reminis-
cences Delights and Prejudices is high
among the non-fiction best sellers. Some
critics have praised it as the most readable
gastronomical contribution to the English-
speaking world in years. Mr. Beard has just
returned from a summer in Europe and
comments below on recent vintages
and provides us with current information
on Paris and London.

THE DRUMS ARE STARTING TO BEAT.
The echoes from the cheers for the 1959
vintage had hardly faded when M. Edgar
Pisani, France’s Minister of Agriculture,
proclaimed in July that the 1964’s repre-
sented the “greatest vintage year since 1921”
and promptly told the members of the
French Chamber of Deputies to acquire a
barrel or two while there was still time. Of
necessity, the good Minister was engaging
in some doubtful crystal-ball gazing, since
much can happen between July and Sep-
tember 20th, when the harvest begins. There
can be too much rain — or not enough rain
— or hail. The score is never final until the
sun enters the House of Capricorn (about
Dec. 22) when the wine comes “fallen
bright” due to cold, and the heavy sediment,
cloudiness, and yeast falls to the bottom,
leaving the wine crystal bright and ready
for the first possible tasting after the vin-
tage. Until then, all comments on quality
must be speculative, statistical and never
definitive.

I AM PUZZLED as to why Monsieur Pisani
(He was born in 1918 —a fine year)
chose 1921 as the greatest preceding year.
I have tasted some excellent Lanson ’21,
Y quem ’21,and some other great white wines
of that vintage, such as the Rhines and
Moselles. However, I have been around a
long time and I have yet to taste my first
bottle of truly great 1921-claret or any other
red wine for that matter. For red wines,
1921 goes down to history as a year of
scorched grape-skins, with only Cheval
3lane winning André Simon’s praise: “the
only perfect wine made in the Gironde in
this year.”

WHAT ARE THE FACTS? Here was the
1964 timetable
spring, with temperature in the 70’s during

a mild winter; an early

March; continual warm weather leading to
fairly early flowering; on June 3 heavy rain
storms, with intermittent hail, which caused
an estimated loss of 10% of the eventual
crop. After this setback, there was superb
hot sunny weather (at times the temperature
exceeded 100°F') ; there was some fear that
the lack of rain would result in a low yield,
but, within the last three weeks, some good
rain has fallen and the grapes have swelled
noticeably. The Sauternes is already rated
as another 1921, the Medoc and red Graves
promise to be truly spectacular! However,

I am one of those who does not cry “vintage
of the century” until the wine can be tasted

about Christmas. I must also report that

 

during July and August, many chateaux
sold futures at the record breaking price of
almost one million francs per tonneau of 96
cases — five times the opening price of the
1959’s, and almost double the opening price
of the 1961’s. By these standards, any ’59’s
or ’61’s that you see on Sherry’s list are not
just good values but astonishing bargains.

LET US GO EAST to Burgundy and the
Rhone Valley. Like Bordeaux, BURGUNDY
has been basking in the sun. The reds will
hopefully have enough sugar to reduce chap-
telisation to a minimum, and a higher alco-
holic content should give them more stamina
than the 1959’s. At this crucial point every
rainfall means another cask of wine to the
grower. The present cooler weather con-
tinues to give the necessary acidity. An early
harvest on about September 20 is envisaged.

PARIS IS A WONDEREAND every time I
revisit it. Perhaps the saddest note was
struck when I learned that Georges has re-
tired as Head Barman at the Ritz after being
a fixture of Parisian society for almost four
decades ... The new bistro discovery is the
simple, utterly delightful Petit Coq on Rue
Budapest . . . My current enthusiasm in-
volves a twenty minute taxi ride from the
Plaza Athenée to the 14th Arondissement:
it is the Auberge de Argoat on Avenue

Reille. Only thirty people can be served for
dinner, so reservations are essential. The
prices are unbelieveably reasonable, and
this tiny food shrine is presided over by M.
Goaragueer, who is both chef and pro-
prietor. The wine cellar reflects his taste.
trust him for
the food, and let him suggest from his cellar

Put yourself in his hands

the bottles of wine that do not even appear
on the wine list ... Many of us tend to over-
look the Tour d’Argent, just as many of us
no longer go to the Louvre or Notre Dame.
The fact that this great restaurant is so well
known to tourists does not detract from the
fact that it is probably the greatest three-
star restaurant in Paris. I do not mean that
you should order the much _ publicized
pressed duck just because it is so famous;
choose such specialties as Croustade Barbue
Lagrene, Quenelles de Brochet. And, of
course, there is the fun of wandering
through its historic wine cellars ... Every-
one in Paris seems to be talking about the
new experience in present-day dining which
takes place at the newly redecorated and
renovated LEDOYEN, strategically located
on the Champs Elysées. The genial host is
Gilbert Lejeune, former maitre d’ hétel of
the famed Lasserre. The food is good, the
wine is good, the surroundings uncompro-
misingly luxurious . .. For those of us
who love cooking at home, there is always
an interest in gazing at the moulds, copper
stock pots and shiny heavy utensils that we
see hanging in the bistros of Paris. Where
can they be bought, we often ask? For the
widest array, there is the firm of Dehillerin
in les Halles. But, believe it or not, you will
not be disappointed with the choice or the
prices if you go to the basement kitchen-
ware department of Galleries Lafayette and
Printemps...

   

 

 

 

OF MY STAY IN LONDON, I suppose the
highlight was picnicing at the country house
of André Simon. There were only four of us
— the remarkable 86 year old André pre-
siding — Elizabeth David, who prepared the
lunch, and whom I consider the outstanding
authority on French cooking in the English
speaking world — and Hugh Johnson, edi-
tor of the Wine and Food Quarterly. The
food was good picnic fare, which included
an old recipe for spiced beef, Italian capo-
nata and a collection of English cheeses.
The wines were 1962 country wines, picked
at random from André Simon’s cellar —
there were six of them . . . the London res-
taurants that delighted me on this last trip
are the White Tower in Soho — the never
disappointing Connaught Grill; the gastro-
nomical temple devoted to fish, Maison
Prunier; the glamourous Mirabelle—and a
new discovery, the Daphne in Chelsea . . .

THE INVENTION OF THE CORK-
SCREW, about two centuries ago, made
wine drinking easier: it is hard to imagine
living without one now. If I had to point out
the most epochal advance in wine drinking
since then, I would be inclined to single out
the forthcoming 450 page classic-to-be —
ENCYCLOPEDIA OF WINE by Frank
Schoonmaker. The bulky galley proofs of
this book—a monument both to Mr. Schoon-
maker’s life work and to his dedication to
viniculture — have kept me awake nights,
simply because the pages have proven so
pleasurable, absorbing, revealing, and re-
warding. It should be on the night-table of
every wine connoisseur.

My only fear is that my good friend, Walter
Frese, president of Hastings House, the pub-
lishers, is a shade too conservative in his
estimate of sales: the first edition will be
about 15,000 copies — a quantity that, in my
opinion, will be gone long before Christmas.
No doubt the first edition will quickly be
followed by a second, a third, and so on,
ad infinitum. But to make sure you have
your copy, I urge you to act quickly. Order
it now, and make certain that you are not
among those frustrated wine lovers who will
have to borrow a copy from a friend.
(Assuming he’s willing to lend it!) Since
the publication date is set for mid-
November, it might not be a bad idea to
order a copy now as an exciting Christmas
gift for those of your friends who are eager
to learn more about wine.

Presenting Some of the Great

Rare Red Glarets

of BORDE

@ Here are the much sought-after great red
wines of Bordeaux, authentic survivors of a
previous decade. Commercially they are non-
existent and acquiring them is akin to the art
collector’s search for a Matisse or a Cezanne.
Here are classic wines, available only in small
quantity, that are true masterpieces — sheer
perfection to the fanciers of great, old Claret.
