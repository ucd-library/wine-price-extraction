VER 30 YEARS have elapsed since we first opened our doors
and dedicated ourselves to the principle of offering wines
and spirits of indisputable origin and merit at the lowest prices.
The wisdom of this long range policy has been confirmed by the
gratifying growth in our clientele from year to year.
And now, in the Fall of 1964, here is one of the most excep-
tional SALE OPPORTUNITIES OF OUR HISTORY. In general,
there have been substantial cost increases at the vineyards and

distilleries, but we have rolled back the prices of many items to

reflect our original cost, and not what the present market should
dictate. We strongly advise the acquisition of your Fall and
Winter requirements at these low sale prices.

And now, more than ever, during these days of fluidity and
change, we continue dedicated to our historic policy of con-
stantly searching for the best within each price category. We
intend maintaining our leadership as the ‘“‘wine and spirit center
of New York,” whether it be for Thanksgiving or Christmas;

in 1965; or a decade hence.

Barristers’ Choice
RARE OLD SCOTCH

86 Proof

Yes! You read this correctly — we are
offering a 12 year old Scotch, bottled
at a full 86 proof, at only $4.99 the
bottle — possibly the lowest price
whisky of this calibre has ever been
offered in New York since 1942. How
is this possible? The 12 year old
whisky was imported in barrels and
bottled here. Its source is impeccable.
Under its original label, it would com-
mand over $8 — and there is no loss
in quality whatsoever. Quantity lim-
ited. Please act quickly to avoid dis-
appointment.

The Seoteh Find of the Year?

James Boswell

SCOTCH

It took years of tasting and planning

on our part to be able to offer a Scotch

of this high intrinsic merit at $3.99

the bottle! One thing that helped us

is the tax saving by importing it in

cask —the other is the fact that

there is a further tax saving in
bottling at 80 proof. The taste linac >

will probably match most of the . Boswel]
