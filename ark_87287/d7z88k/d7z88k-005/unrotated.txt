Frank Schoonmaker, who
found this 1934 SINGLE CASK
unblended Cognac (and we
here at Sherry’s), believe it is
probably one of the best Co-
gnacs of France. A true dis-
covery for those who like to
linger over fine brandy in front
of the fireplace, amidst pleas-
ant conversation,

The price has gone up $10 the &

Report from Europe
(Continued from page 3)
3ACK ON THE FARM at
Sherry’s some astonishing things
were accomplished while I relaxed
in Provence, and worked in Paris
and London. My colleagues,
Jack and Sam Aaron, inform methat
this summer they worked late every
evening, to meet the challenge of
this fall and winter season. All of
us, if we have been following the
papers at all, are fully aware that
new directions will be established,
and Jack and Sam, after thirty
years of leadership, not only intend
to maintain their position, but feel
that they owe it to their clientele
to protect them, more than ever, in
terms of quality and price. If my
barometer reads correctly, you can

look for some exciting things flow-
ing out of the creative energy of
the Aarons and their colleagues. I
had hardly been back a day when
I became delightfully conscious of
the fact that Sherry’s do not boast
idly about being the “wine and
spirit center of New York” but
have amassed evidence over the
summer to prove it even to the most
doubtful skeptic.

I TASTED THEIR $3.99 James
Boswell Scotch and it was not just
good, but excellent!; | hardly
know anywhere else you can get
such completely acceptable full
quarts of gin and vodka at $3.99
the Mouton and Lafite Rothschild
1960 is not only drinkable but su-
perb claret by anybody’s standards.

My favorite cognac, Single Cask, is
there in all its glory; I know no-
where in the country where you
can match Sherry’s collection of
rare old clarets; the Ledoyen 1959
Champagne was good in its native
habitat in Paris, and it is equally
good here; I suppose Dowling 12
Yr. Old Bonded is about as good
as bourbon that emanates from
Kentucky; I agree with Frank
Schoonmaker that Vosne-Romanee
la Grande Rue 1961 is probably as
great a red wine as any produced
in the Cote d’Or during that fabu-
lous year; and fresh from drinking
aperitifs in France, I know of noth-
ing that I consumed at the side-
walk cafes of Paris more satisfying
than La Seine—and it’s only $2.49
the full litre!

YW7E all admire the superlative wines that are produced
W in Bordeaux, Burgundy, Champagne, and the Rhine
and Moselle. But man cannot live by caviar alone. Per-
haps the most rewarding experience for the wine drinker
is to wander among the bypaths of the vast vineyard of
Europe and make his own discoveries — wines that have
their own integrity, their own message, their own charm—
and wines that need not be expensive — as any price-

conscious wine lover can testify.
