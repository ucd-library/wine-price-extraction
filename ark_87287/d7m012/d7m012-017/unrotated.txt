 

   

in the recorded history of Burgundy. If
you are sure of your source, and the wine
is an authentic one, we can report that
there are almost no bad wines at all—even
the lesser village vineyards gave wines
of remarkable merit — early maturing,
fruity, soft and attractive—scheduled to
be bottled in the Spring of 1961 and
ready to be enjoyed not long thereafter.
The greater vineyards have produced
wines somewhat better than the charming
1953s and there are some growers who
quickly compare them to the 1929s of
treasured memory.

WHITE BURGUNDY

Here too 1959 can be described as
sensationally great. Old Mr. Monnot, ap-
proaching 80 years, whom we have visited
often, says that it is the best year of his
lifetime. The white wines will be full
bodied, great wines by all standards, but
some producers may run into wines that
are too high in alcohol, too low in acid,
and will be short lived. The best 1959s,
carefully selected, will be similar to the
1947s and 1952s and probably better than
either. Fortunately, for those fond of
white Burgundy, the superb 1955s, 1957s
and 1958s, all good years, will be avail-
able until these appear on the scene.

RED BORDEAUX

On November 23rd, we received a
letter from the proprietor of one of the
great vineyards of Bordeaux who reports
“the climate has been exceptionally dry
and sunny, the grapes in perfect condi-
tion at the time of harvest, in fact, I had
not witnessed it in 30 years, the grape
gathering took place in good time; all
of the crop was ripe at the same time and
what could have been a disaster had it
rained, turned into a success as we were
able to pick the whole quantity before
it started raining again.” With the result
that in the Medoe and the Graves district
of Bordeaux especially, 1959 will surely
rank as one of the very greatest years
since 1900 for quality, but the total quan-
tity did prove a bit disappointing in

   

Bordeaux, and did not share the good
fortune of Burgundy in this regard. The
quality may be a shade less good in
St. Emilion and Pomerol where rains,
shortly before the vintage, slightly
marred an otherwise perfect Summer.
Quite properly, the wines have been com-
pared to the 1929s in class and distinction
and will mature fairly early like the
1953s. Interestingly enough, they will be
ready to drink before the 1957s which
still seem hard and are destined to mature
slowly.

These are not wines to drink three
decades hence, but will surely delight us
until 1975. As in 1947, almost all of the
wines of Bordeaux, even the lesser vine-
yards, show great promise and the usual
class distinctions among the vineyards
are lessened in such a year. Here are
wines that the entire world will be seek-
ing and we strongly suspect that they will
be hard to acquire or extremely expensive
in the not too distant future.

COTES DU RHONE

In this area, usually favored by the
Summer sun, 1959 was much less spec-
tacular than its more northerly neigh-
bors. Do not look for outstanding virtues
here. While generally pleasing and quite
good the wines will not achieve any peak
in quality—certainly no better than the
delightful 1955s or 1957s, if indeed as
good.

ALSACE

During the last days of November we
received a letter from the respected owner
of Caves Hanhart in which he says quite
proudly “we consider here the 1959 har-
vest the vintage of the century, one which
can be compared to the vintage of 1904,
1911, 1921, 1937 and 1945.” It will be
interesting indeed to experience Alsatian
wines that will be full and round, some-
what like the big wines of Germany, in-
stead of the light, fresh wines to which
we have been accustomed to drink from
this district.

LOIRE VALLEY

The Loire river meanders across most
of France and the vast area which it feeds
can hardly be classified as a single vini-
cultural district. In the upper Loire, the
Pouilly Fume, Sancerre and Quincy will
be excellent, not too great in quantity,
wines will be full and fine, and soon
ready. Further downstream, around
Vouvray, the 1959 was a year of extreme
drought and many of the wines may prove
to be too full bodied and much too high

 

in alcohol. Perhaps the most fortunate
area of all was near the Atlantic in Anjou
— the Muscadet country will produce
superb wines, the quantity and quality
going hand in hand. Early in 1960 you
will be able to enjoy the best Muscadet
you have ever tasted at delightfully low
cost.

ITALY

The results were quite uneven in Italy.
Extraordinary rainy weather in late
August and early September in the Pied-
mont area, the home of Barolo (just
across the border from the Rhone Valiey
of France), ruined what promised to be
a great year and the wines can only be
classified as fair. But as we move to the
Shakespeare country of Verona, the wines
of Valpolicella, Bardolino and Soave
promise to have the best vintage they
have produced during the last two dec-
ades. And further south, near Florence,
the Chianti district of Tuscany is giving
forth a quality that is far above average.

GERMANY

Every wine grower of Germany who
has reported to us firmly believe that the
1959s will surpass either 1953 or 1949,
and perhaps even compete with the 1921.
It is hard to judge here because the actual
vintage only ended toward mid-Novem-
ber, but it is safe to say that we are deal-
ing with a fabulous year. But one must
be careful because the German wine
growers adore the sugar-ripe years, with
the built-in natural sweetness. If ones’
taste runs towards lightness and acidity,
the high alcohol and full flavor, superb
as it can be it may not be precisely the
wine that you have bargained for. In
average years, the wines of Germany
grown in a more northerly latitude than
that of Labrador, require that sugar be
added to the lesser regional wines. In this
glorious year of 1959 over 90% of all of
the wine produced will have enough nat-
ural sweetness so that this process can
be dispensed with.
