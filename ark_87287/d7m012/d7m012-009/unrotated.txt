CHOOSE THE SIGNIFICANT YEAR
AS A THOUGHTFUL CHRISTMAS GIFT.

One of the noblest of the worlds great wines is un-
doubtedly an authentic vintage port that has achieved
its maturation, like fine still wine, in bottle rather than
cask. Here is the greatest collection in the world —
moved to our cellars in New York, bottle by bottle,
from the private port museum that Richard Hooper &
Sons have maintained in their country house for almost
a century. Honored guests at their home were asked the
date of their birth or anniversary and a vintage port of
that year was served.

In a small personal way, you can follow the same
thoughtful practice. We suggest sending, as an imagina-
tive birthday or anniversary gift, authentic vintage port
proudly bearing on its label “THE YEAR.’ And do not
overlook the possibilities of sending as the most indi-
vidual of Chrismas gifts, a bottle of port that bears the
year of his birth, anniversary, or any other special event.

If you have not yet experienced the vinous joy of
bottle-aged authentic vintage port, we strongly advise

that you acquire some for your own pleasure.
