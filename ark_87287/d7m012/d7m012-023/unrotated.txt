Here is an extraordinary opportunity to acquire a very rare and out-
standing Scotch, famous for decades as the original truly light whisky
and until recently unobtainable in the U. S$. A. since pre-war days.
Favorite of our fathers, this exclusive Scotch is remembered and ae-
claimed today for its traditional maturity, balance and superiority of
flavor. Very definitely a whisky of remarkable distinction—will delight
the palates of the most demanding Scotch drinkers. It is still carefully
rationed in Britain and limited stocks in the U.S. A. are eagerly sought
after.

As a gift the “Antiquary” is a perfect compliment to the recipient’s
good taste.
