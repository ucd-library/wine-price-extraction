 

TRE ON

 

While shopping for antiques in London last year, we chanced upon a beautifully
executed “FIRKIN”, embellished with brass hoops and it cost $30, which now occu-
pies an honored place in our home. Because everyone was delighted with it we had it
duplicated in New Hampshire in time to present to our clientele this Christmas. Not
only will your selections be presented in the most original fashion, but the recipient

will be forever grateful for the “FIRKIN” and its

manifold after uses—for fireplace logs, magazine or

umbrella holder, plant stand or just as a decorative

object in it’s own right.

ADD ONLY FOR THE “FIRKIN”’

 

In 1957, Her Majesty, Queen Elizabeth II visited Portugal
and to commemorate the event, the entire contents of the cask
which held the 1792 Solera was bottled, interrupting a 165
year slumber. We were fortunate in acquiring some of these
precious bottles and were amazed by its extraordinary
qualities — its full vigor, penetrating bouquet and great
depth of flavor. Being relatively dry, it rivals fine old Cognac
in scope and interest.

Here is a true collector’s item, that soon will be gone—even
a single bottle will add its touch of lustre to the most dis-
tinguished cellar, historic interest to the holiday dinner
party, and heartwarming joy as a unique Christmas gift to

an appreciative friend.
