Special Offering of 1966. 1967 & 1969

This offering represents a unique opportunity to acquire the 1969 vintage in advance—and at a substantial savings. However, we do not recommend that you purchase 1969,
unless you already have a goodly supply of ’66s and ’67s in your cellar, and you are stocking the 69s as a gap-filling successor.

For those of you whose inventory of wines is only on a current basis, and you are not involved in laying down cases for later in the decade, we strongly urge that you acquire

1966 and 1967, rather than take on the ’69s at this point in your wine life. WHY? You need merely read the vintage report that appears in the recent TIME-LIFE book “Wines
& Spirits.” We quote verbatim:

1966—The Chateau owners were happy as they gathered this great vintage; they were able to obtain the highest prices for claret in Bordaux wine history. A bit less body
than the ’64s, but compensated for by unusual bouquet, better balance, and a remarkable similarity to the extraordinary '53’s, as well as sufficient tannin to provide the
backbone for exceptional longevity.

1967—The crop was most beneficial to the wine drinker because it was exceptionally large, above average in quality, and produced a soft, quick-maturing, fruity wine with
a fine bouquet. This most useful, Satisfying vintage can be consumed joyously while we wait for the slower maturing '61s and ’66s to come to their full fruition.
