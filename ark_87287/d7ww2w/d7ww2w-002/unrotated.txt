AN HISTORIC OFFERING of the Famed
DOCTOR BAROLET COLLECTION

of Fine, Old, Rare Red Burgundies

Never has the American Public Been Offered Red Burgundies

of such Depth, Maturity, Greatness and Longevity.

 

HARRY WAUGH, director of Chateau Latour, internationally
famous wine authority, and author of “Bacchus On Wings” —
it is Mr. Waugh who unearthed the Dr. Barolet collection. HIS
COMMENTS APPEAR BELOW.

“It is not often that any follower of the wine trail comes
across a cellar secreting about 30,000 or so bottles of fine, old
Burgundy. The treasure trove in question belonged to the late
Dr. Albert Barolet, who died, aged 71, in 1969. He came from
an old, respected Burgundian family and was blessed with
enough of this world’s goods to make him completely inde-
pendent. The first news of the cellar’s contents reached me soon
after the good Doctor’s death, together with an urgent request
to evaluate the contents as soon as possible.

I learned that it was the Doctor’s father who amassed this
unique collection of historic vintages during the time that his
son was practicing medicine. Upon the death of Dr. Barolet’s
father, the good physician gave up the practice of medicine (he
specialized in Psychiatry ) to indulge in his personal enthusiasm
for collecting the best wines of Burgundy.

One of the ‘Aladdin’s Cave’ corners of the
vast medieval deep underground cellars that
house the precious old Burgundies that the
Barolet family have collected through the
years.

As wine cellars go, those of Burgundy dating back to medie-
val times, must be among the most romantic in the world. So
thick were the cobwebs (or fungus) that I found outside of
some of the bins that I mistook them for a solid, black wall.
Descending into them, as I did in September, I felt as if I were
entering an Aladdin’s Cave. Here was truly a Rip Van Winkle
atmosphere, everything sleeping and untouched throughout the
decades. It has taken me a happy, challenging three months to
taste all of the bin’s contents and verify the quality.

The style of present day Burgundies differ markedly from
their predecessors. The older vintages have a deeper color,
more depth, fruit and flavor easily detected simply by tasting—
their keeping qualities can immediately be spotted and quickly
verified by the nose and palate.

The possibility of acquiring wines from the Dr. Barolet col-
lection is surely a heaven-sent opportunity for the younger
generation to experience for themselves the kind of Burgundy
their fathers and grandfathers speak about and enjoyed.”

GERALD ASHER, one of England’s great wine authorities
and wine writer for the Sunday London Times, COMMENTS:

“Whilst I was in Burgundy on a cold January day, I visited Dr. Barolet’s caves, so that I can give you an up to date
word-picture of what I saw. The ancient house and courtyard had the air of a stage set for “Sleeping Beauty.’ As luck
would have it, on the day I visited, the town’s electrical system broke down, so I had to taste by candle light. It proved
to be a ‘Magical Wonderland’ of old vintages—the bottles smothered thick with time’s growth, rather like sheets of

cotton wadding.

Every area was taken up with a cache of bottles, the inevitable result of a true collector’s instinct—there were even
niches over the doors holding such hallowed years as 1893 and 1899. I happily tasted my way through some of the
ancient vintages and I was astonished by the vigor and youth expressed by these unbelievably old Burgundies. I had
rather thought that such longevity in red wine was mainly the domain of Bordeaux—but Burgundy can also claim

some sprightly worthy survivors of time’s toll.”
