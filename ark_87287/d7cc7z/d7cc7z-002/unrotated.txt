MADEIRA (continued)

era, and Madeira tasting parties be-
came a standard pastime in the
Tidewater region of Maryland and
Virginia. We can picture such a
gathering in the elegant dining
room of a country home. The
shining mahogany table reflects
the shifting lights of the candles in
silver candlesticks. Before each
guest is an array of glasses. At the
host’s elbow are a dozen or more
decanters, each containing a dif-
ferent Madeira. The attitude of
participants in such tastings was
one of utmost seriousness. Smoking
was not permitted; even the aroma
of tobacco dulled one’s palate.
The decanters of Madeira ranging
in color from golden to amber
to brown, were passed around
the table, and as the men sipped
they commented on the merits of
each wine. He whose favorite
was rejected was an unhappy
man.

What happened to the prolonged
love affair between Americans and
Madeira wines? First came disaster
in the form of a fungus that struck
the vineyards of the island in the
mid-19th Century. For some years
the vines were ‘“‘sick,’’ and the
Madeira left over from
stocks was

former
preciously guarded.
War between the
States, shipments were curtailed.

During the

Not long after, the dread phylloz-
era devastated the vineyards. This
was a disease brought in by native
that had been
transplanted for experimentation.
Again Madeira stocks had to be
conserved. By the early 1900’s
Madeira was once more available

in some quantity, but then the
world was plunged into war and
German submarines roamed the
Atlantic shipping lanes. At the end
of the war America had entered
the infamous era of Prohibition
and devotees of Madeira could no
longer order their favorite wine.

When Repeal came in 1933, the
new generation knew nothing of
the charms of Madeira or, for that
matter, of any other wines.
Madeira wines were only a faint
memory of a leisurely past.

Today, at last, we seem to be
recapturing some of the gracious
living of our past, and we are
rediscovering Madeira.

What of the Madeiras we drink
today? Are they the equals of the
wine of the past century? Of the
seductive Butler 16 that lured

Webster so successfully?
there been changes?

If there are changes, I feel sure
they are for the better. There
were, we know, great Madeiras 100
and 150 years ago. There are great
Madeiras today, and more predict-
ably so. The modern shippers have
the advantage of many more years
of experimenting to perfect the
product. When brandy was first
added to the wine, it was done in
a haphazard fashion. There was
no definite formula—no specific
amount prescribed. Like cooking
by an old recipe, one guessed—a
pinch of this, a dash of that, or to
taste. Today’s shipper knows just
how much brandy, just when to
add it, and how long to age the
wine to get the right results.

Madeiras still come in every
type: from dry to sweet, from
golden to brown, from light to rich.
But today they are known by grape
variety; the name of the grape on
the bottle tells us what to expect
when we pull the cork.

Have

IRST, there is Sercial. This is

a light, dry wine suitable for
apéritif, for the soup course and, as
many Madeira lovers will tell you,
for drinking straight through the
meal. As dry as it is, it has only a
slight acidy taste. It is smooth and
tender on the tongue with a re-
freshing aftertaste. Sercial is the
palest in color—a light golden, but
the term “‘pale’’ is misleading, for
it has brightness or sheen. The
Sercial grape is related to the Ries-
ling of Alsace and Germany, but
on the semi-tropical island of
Madeira it takes on new charac-
teristics. Grown high on the
terraced hillsides, it holds a hint
of tangy mountain air.

Next is Verdelho, not so dry as
Sercial, but definitely not sweet.
There is a little less tang, a little
more softness and a warm amber
color. Verdelho, too, can be the
constant the drink
with hors d’oeuvres, with soup,
with a bit of sweet. This grape is
related to the Pedro Ximenez of
Spain, but, like Sercial, grown on
this remote island, it develops a
special quality.

Bual, the third type of Madeira,
is a medium sweet wine with a
richer, deeper amber color. Wine
authorities have often waxed elo-
quent to the extreme over Bual. It
is admired for its delicate balance,

maining Madeira. Serve chilled.

Boeuf a la Porto Novo
(Beef Scallops with Madeira)

4 half-inch slices of French bread

sheet to keep warm while dish is
being made.

Melt butter and olive oil. When

very fast and should be at least
pink when they are served, so be

careful not to overcook them. Re-
move to a plate and keep warm.

serving plate or on individual
plates. Spoon beef in Madeira
sauce on top. Sprinkle with finely
chopped truffles, if available, and
