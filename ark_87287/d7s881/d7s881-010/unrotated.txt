PINOT CHARDONNAY
LES CHARMES 1977

A gold medal winning glory
from the Maconnais of
southern Burgundy. This
outstanding Pinot Chardon-
nay les Charmes won the
top award in its class at the
Paris Wine Fair for its clean
dryness, grace and distin-
guished bouquet. The price
is lower than one would ex-
pect for a wine of this quality
—only $4.49 the bottle, 48.50
the case.

 

SABLANT BRUT

Sparkling Wine from the Loire

The Christmas-New Year’s
period is the joyous time
when Champagne comes in-
to its own. For those who are
economy-minded, it must be
remembered that great spar-
kling wine is produced in
France outside the Cham-
pagne district. This Sablant
Brut proves it. Since the pro-
prietor is the distinguished
firm of Piper Heidsieck, all of
their Champagne skills were
brought to the Loire. You will
discover a beautiful harmony
of fruit and bouquet coupled
with dryness.
