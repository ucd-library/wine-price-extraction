Astonishing fact! The average 4-bottle Jeroboam of French
Champagne usually fetches about $80; the average 8-bottle
Methusulah is normally sold at about $185. Here we are offering
you the superb LANSON BLACK LABEL BRUT Jeroboams at
$65.95 each, and the Methusulahs at $94.45 each. How can you

resist?

Through the years, our clients have told us that the most inspired,
dramatic—and appreciated of gifts are the giant bottles of top-
flight French Champagne in these massive, impressive, over-
sized bottles. We are not talking about an ordinary Champagne
—but the world-famous LANSON BLACK LABEL BRUT. Unfor-
tunately, we have but 20 cases of each—and they will go fast.
First come, first served. All will be gone before Christmas Day.

Our fathers often tell us of the ex-
cellence and virtues of the Pre-
Prohibition Bourbons of their
youth. We recently conuucted a
blind tasting, matching the “20
Year Old Collector’s Item” against
two whiskies that were distilled in
1913 and bottled in 1933. To
everyone’s surprise, the ‘Col-
lector’s Item’ was chosen as the
better. If you have friends or
relatives that truly appreciate rare
old bourbon, now is the time to ac-
quire your supply for your
Christmas needs—because the
probability is that our limited inven-
tory will be exhausted before the
end of the year.
