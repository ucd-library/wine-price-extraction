Did you see column
in the Living Section of the

Wednesday, December 6th? The headline
proclaims, ‘Despite the high prices, there is no
shortage of wine, or of bargains.’ We agree—
but the problem of the wine consumer still re-
mains—to intelligently find the bargains and
be happily rewarded with good wine at
modest cost. Mr. Prial’s column inspired us to
analyze our own wine holdings criti-
cally—and to identify with the wine drinker
who would like to acquire good red and white
wines below $4.00 the bottle. We quote Mr.
Prial and supplement his comments with our
own.

;— ‘As more and more
people get into wine, the demand for the most
famous names goes up and up—and so do the
prices.... Perhaps we won’t be drinking as
much white Burgundy as we’d like for the next
few years, and first-growth Bordeaux may be
beyond the reach of most mere mortals for
some time... here then, is the result of several
forays into shops in the New York area in re-
cent days, plus a few tips from friends.
Nothing in this group costs more than $4.00
and some are considerably less. All of them, at
the moment, represent good bargains. Some
are, of course, in short supply; wine is not
Campbell’s soup.

s—if you find that good red
Bordeaux are beyond your reach, why not try
a Champigny from the Loire Valley, made
from Cabernet Franc grapes? (Editors’ note:
Our Champigny Rouge 1973 is still available
at $3.99 the bottle, $46.75 the case.) Speaking
of the Medoc, the greatest of all the Bordeaux
wine regions, how about a 1974 Chateau
Greysac for $3.99...anda 1973 Haut-Medoc,
Chateau Latour Blanche 1973 for $3.99?
(Editors’ note: Both excellent red Bordeauxs
are available at our shop.)

“Burgundy is pretty much a lost
cause in our price range, but asharp buyer can
find some wines from the lesser communes.
(Editors’ note: We agree—if one gives up the
more exalted names such as Gevrey-Cham-
bertin, Clos Vougeot and Vosne-Romanee, it
is still possible to get good red Burgundy at
modest cost. Here are some of our best ex-
amples: Quillardet’s Bourgogne Pinot Noir
1972 at $4.49; de Villaine’s Bourgogne
Bouzeron 1974 at $4.99; and Leroy’s amazing
Bourgogne d’Auvenay 1971 at $5.79.)

-—‘‘Beaujolais prices
are out of sight at the moment. Ironically, the
indifferent 1977 vintage, now much in
evidence in the stores, is on the average 25 per-
cent more expensive than the superb 1976 vin-
tage. By shopping around, it is still possible to
pick up some good 1976s in our price range.
(Editors’ note: Both the 1976 and 1978 Beau-
jolais vintages have earned the adjective
superb. 1976 is irreplaceable—but we still
have available for delivery, should you order
promptly, the following: Quinson’s Beaujo-
lais at $3.99; Louis Tete’s Beaujolais at $4.99;
Lord Marple’s Fleurie at $4.99; and Louis
Tete’s Chenas at $5.99—all 1976.)

+‘‘Buy some of the 1976s to hold you
until the 1978s come along next Spring. They
are expected to be good and, because the crop
was large, prices should hold or drop a bit. If
you can’t wait, the 1978 Beaujolais Nouveau
are arriving in the stores now. (Editors’ note:
We’re excited about how good the just-
arrived 1978 Beaujolais Primeur can be. Here
are the three best: Pellerin’s at $3.79, $43.95
the case; Piat’s at $4.49, $48.50 the case; and
Beaudet’s at $4.49.)

t—‘‘The Californians still have plenty of
good wine for us in the under-$4 area. One of
my favorites, Beaulieu Vineyard’s Beau Tour
Cabernet Sauvignon 1975 is still to be had at
$3.99. (Editors’ note: California vignerons
are proving their skills with these wines. You
will find in our shop: the Beau Tour Cabernet
Sauvignon 1975 at $3.99 bottle, $43.09 the

case. Also Sonoma’s 1974 Zinfandel at $3.30

bottle, $37.65 the case. Don’t overlook
Sonoma’s Alexander’s Crown Cabernet
Sauvignon 1975 (a prize winner) at $11.95 the
bottle.)

t-‘‘The celebrated Stag’s Leap Wine
Cellars in Napa Valley offer a rich 1977
Gamay Beaujolais for $3.99, an interesting in-
troduction to this winery, which caused a sen-
sation with its Cabernet Sauvignon a couple
of years ago. (Editors’ note: We happily
report we still have a few cases left at $3.99 the
bottle, $46.75 the case.)

+ ‘‘During the price rise in the
early 1970s, many wine drinkers happily dis-
covered the wines of the Rhone Valley.
History is repeating itself even though the
bargains are not as pronounced as they were
then. There are no more Cotes-du-Rhone at
$1.75 a bottle, as there were in 1972, but there
are some good ones to be had for $3 or a little
more. Several shops have the Vidal Fleury
1976 for around $3.50; the La Vieille Ferme is
a little less in New York, a little more in New
Jersey. (Editors’ note: Hurray! We have all
the wonderful wines of La Vieille Ferme:—La
Vieille Ferme Rouge 1976 at $2.99 the bottle,
$34.75 the case; La Vieille Ferme Blanc de
Blancs also at $2.99 the bottle, $34.75 the
case; and the more long-lived of the three,
Cotes-du-Rhone Rouge 1976 at $3.49 the
bottle, $39.95 the case. All are destined to go
up substantially by Spring 1979.)

t-‘‘Spain offers some good red wines
from the Rioja region for under $4, including
recent vintages of the Marques de Murietta,
Marques de Caceres, Domecq Domain, Bo-
degas Bilbainas and Rioja Vega. The Marques
de Caceres 1971, for example, sells for about
$3.50 in a few places. A number of the wines
under the Torres label, made in Penades, near
Barcelona are excellent bargains and fall well
within today’s guidelines. (Editors’ note: We
cheer again! We offer almost all of these
wonderful reds from Spain. Our favorite is
the remarkable Marques de Caceres 1971 and
1973 Rioja at only $3.49 the bottle, $37.69 the
case. Also available are Marques de Murietta
1973 at $3.99; Bodegas Bilbainas at $2.99;
Torres Coronas 1974 at $2.99; and the famed
Marques de Riscal at $3.98. Viva Espana!)

t—‘‘Some of the finest red wines in the
world are made in Italy and some of the finest
Italian red wines are still under $4 the bottle.
... 1973 Barolo Riserva from the house of
Bosca is $3.99 in one shop; a smooth Nebbiolo
d’Alba shipped by Valfieri is $3.89, and a 1970
Barbera from Calissano is still $3.50 in several
stores. (Editors’ note: Bosca’s Barolo Riserva
1973 can be found here at $3.99; the Nebbiolo
d’Alba also at $3.99; and the mature 1970
Barbera from Calissano at $3.39. Viva Italia!)

t‘‘These notes have dealt only with
premium-level red wines. No jugs this time
and no generics—blends called Burgundy in
California and given-names like Pontet-
Latour in France. Remember: wine prices
change overnight these days and supply is
always a sometime thing. This list is really just
to show what can be done, even in a tight wine
market.’ (Editors’ note: Frank Prial ran out
of valuable New York Times space. However,
we cannot ignore the useful jug wines that
become particularly meaningful at large holi-
day gatherings. We have tasted them all and
we find the best buys are: Red—the superb
Italian Valtellina 1975 available in handsome
59-oz. jugs at $4.49 each, $25.60 the case of
six. White—our ‘best buy’ candidate is Cali-
fornia’s Sonoma Vineyards Chenin Blanc
1977 in its generous 50.7-oz. decanter jug at
$5.69 each, $32.50 the case of six.)
