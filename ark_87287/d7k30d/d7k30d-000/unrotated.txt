’6{ BURGUNDY GETS
ASPARKLING PRICE

May Be Best of the Century,
Experts Say—and Pay

By ROBERT ALDEN
Special to The New York Times.

|; BEAUNE, France, Nov. 20—
|The 1961 Burgundy vintage will
/be the most expensive ever.

| In the opinion of the experts
here, the 1961 vintage is possi-
bly the best of this century.
jOnly 1929 is put in its class.|
| The average price paid at yes-
terday’s auction for the benefit|
of the Hospices de Beaune for a
\caSk containing the equivalent
of 228 bottles of wine was $814.
| The 1959 vintage, widely
jheralded as a great one that is
so expensive that it has been

all but priced out of the market
even before its red wines are
ready for drinking, sold for an
‘average of $479 a cask. That
imeans that the 1961 vintage will
be more than half again as ex-
‘pensive as the 1959.

 

3 Reasons for High Prices

There are three reasons for
tie Nigh prices.on the LoL
vintage,

Frost early in June, when

| of the experts chosen to judge

 

the vine plants were in flower,
‘substantially reduced the size
;of the crop.

| A sunny, dry August in the
|Burgunda wine-growing region
has apparently made the
press of the surviving grapes
extraordinarily good. The ex-
perts have spent the last three
days here sampling the still-
jgreen 1961 vintage and their
jenthusiasm was reflected in
| bidding.

he market for fine Frénch,
vintage wines, particularly the|
United States market, has heen)
expanding rapidly. Projecting
six or seven years into the fu-|
ture, when the 1961 red Bur-|,
gundies will be really coming
into their own, the market for
these wines may be such that
their price at retail, when they
are obtainable at all, may be
astonishingly high.

Some Tie It to Demand

There are pessimists here
who say that it is this last
factor and the matter of the
somewhat smaller yield this
year that are responsible for
the extraordinary prices paid
for the wine here.

However, the official verdict

the 1961 wines over the week-
end was that, taken as a whole,
the Burgundy wines of 1961
“have the character of a great
year and are apt to have a long
life.”

The wine experts here who
make their: iiving buying and
bottling wine in wholesale lots
apparently agreed with the jury
and) were willing to back up
their judgment in the hidding.

The first lot of wines put up
for sale, a Beaune, Dames Hos-
pitaliéres, brought a _ price
equivalent to $1,183 a cask,
compared with the previous rec-
ord for a red Burgundy—$714—
paid for another Beaune,
Dames Hospitaliéres in 1965.

The bidding reached a peak
for the red wines with the sale
of four casks of Auxey-Dur-
esses, Doillot, at $1,380 a cask,
or about $6 a bottle.

The price may be quadru-
pled by the time the wine ap-|
pears in retail stores six or
seven years from now, the in-|
crease covering costs of bot-
tling, shipping, taxes and profit
for importers and retailers.
