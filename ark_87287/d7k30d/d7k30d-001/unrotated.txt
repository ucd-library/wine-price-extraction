Last week we joyously pocketed our airplane ticket that would
take us to the November 19th Hospices De Beaune auction in
Burgundy. It was therefore a bit discouraging for us to cancel
out at the last minute because report after report reached us
from France that the prices would be record-breaking, and to
buy and sell wine at such astronomical levels was dangerous,
less than wise, and not suited to Sherry’s general policy.

This historic auction took place only last week and was epoch-
making in France. Simultaneously, an important wine event
was taking place at Sherry’s. The great 1959 Burgundies,
which we still believe are the best and most enjoyable of our
lifetime, are now arriving to bring their glory to you.

Even the lesser wines are excellent and the best are fantastically
great. An unparalleled year, rich in fruit, well-balanced and
ready to drink early. Let them bring their holiday joy to you.

Practically no 1959 estate bottled Burgundies worth acquiring
remain in the cellars of the growers. Where they are available,
they would undoubtedly command a higher price today than
the record-breaking prices just achieved by the new vintage—
1961.

We are happy to report that the prices are not yet out of hand;
but, in view of present demands, authentic 1959s will either be
unobtainable or double the prices listed below in two or three
years. Any wine listed here is from _an impeccable source, hap-
pily offered to you at the low acquisition cost of two years ago
and not based on the dramatically-high prices that now prevail
in France.

1959 RED BURGUNDIES

No. Bottle
*223 MOULIN-A-VENT, BURDELINES 2.19
Estate bottled, Mousset
The magnificence of the 1959 in the Beaujolais district particularly ex-
pressed itself among the Estate bottlings of the better villages such as
Moulin-a-Vent and Fleurie. This wine is full, slow to develop for a
Beaujolais, fruity, with a perfume rarely achieved in a red wine.

*206 FLEURIE, LES MORIERS 2.19 24.50
Estate bottled, Mousset
Another extraordinary example of great Beaujolais. Estate bottled by
an outstanding producer from vineyards of one of the better villages.

*246 CHATEAU DE MONTHELIE
Estate bottled, Suremain
Just south of Volnay and up a dirt road is the tiny village of Monthelie.
Less known than Volnay they sometimes achieve the stature of the good
Volnays but cost considerably less. Here is the best single vineyard of
the township and the wine was superb in 1959.

#172 CHAMBOLLE MUSIGNY

Estate bottled, Domaine Roumier
Alain Roumier, not yet thirty, was elected Mayor of his village, Cham-
bolle Musigny, about a year ago. Like his father before him, he is the
cellarmaster of the Comte de Vogue, but has a few small vineyards of
his own. Handled with great skill and unremitting care, these wines are
of exceptional class. The 1959—light, delicate, bouqueté—is out-
standing.

CHASSAGNE MONTRACHET,
CAILLERETS te eee Bie ae
Estate bottled, Delagrange

Red wine from the Chassagne Montrachet district is a rarity and hard
to come by. This one is well-balanced, soft, rich in fruit, and repre-
sents really fine Burgundy at low cost.

BEAUNE GREVES . ! eee
Estate bottled, Duvault-Blochet

The better vineyards of Beaune are characterized by softness and
lightness, noted for finesse and aroma, and are relatively quick to
mature. Here is perhaps the best single vineyard of this famed wine
producing town and is a true glory in 1959.

VOLNAY CHAMPANS 3.29 36.75
Estate bottled, Marquis d’Angerville

We recently visited the good Marquis, a young civilized, handsome man
man who takes his wine most seriously. We believe that in the 1959
vintage his ‘Champans’ vineyard yielded his best-balanced, and perhaps
his best, Volnay.

CHAPELLE CHAMBERTIN .............----
Estate bottled, Clair-Dau

Only a narrow road separates Chapelle Chambertin from the directly
adjoining Clos de Beze, and when well made, Chapelle Chambertin
is a true aristocrat, with enormous power and breed. The producer and
estate bottler, in this case, M. Clair-Dau, is one of the most highly con-
sidered producers of Burgundy and almost invariably wins one of the
Gold Medals at the great agricultural exposition in Paris.

OSTA 2. 3.99
Estate bottled, R. Engel

An interesting combination of body and strength that will improve
considerably with age. Great class at low cost.

POMMARD, LES EPENOTS ............00......
Estate bottled, Domaine Parent

Pommard is the best known of all Burgundies, possibly because its
name is easy to remember. The best vineyard is ‘Les Epenots’ which
produces wines of great finesse, softness and superb bouquet. Hard to
come by, here is a great 1959.

POMMARD RUGIENS 3.99 43.95
Estate bottled, Felix Clerget

The only rival to the ‘Les Epenots’ vineyard in Pommard is ‘Rugiens’.
It required much persuasion on our part to convince this reluctant
grower to part with the most precious barrel in his cellars.

VOSNE ROMANEE,
CLOS DES REAS ................
Estate bottled, L. Gros

The distinguishing characteristics of the great wines of Vosne are
lingering bouquet and rich, full character. In the masterful hands of
Louis Gros, Mayor of the town, the Clos des Reas vinyard has achieved
the delicacy and balance in this year that provides classic distinction.

GEVRY-CHAMBERTIN, ST. JACQUES 3.99 43.95
Estate bottled, Clair Dau

A sleeper! A truly great estate-bottled wine of the Chambertin area from
a grower who has won gold medal after gold medal in competitions—
note astonishingly low cost.

3.99 43.95

CLOS DE TART 4.19 46.25

Estate bottled, J. Mommessin

In the 7th Century a nunnery was founded in the town of Morey, not
far from Gevrey Chambertin, and the Nuns started a vineyard called
Clos de Tart. Today it is the distinguished property of J. Mommessin.
Big, sturdy, long lived, here is one of the crowning jewels of the
Cote d’Or.

CLOS DE VOUGEOT 4.59 49.75
Estate bottled, L’Heretier-Guyot

The wines of Clos de Vougeot vary greatly from one producer's cellar
to another, those coming from along the Route Nationale being far
less good than those produced in the upper part of the hillside adjoin-
ing Musigny, Grands Echezeaux, etc. This particular wine comes from
one of the best portions of the Clos. A splendid 1959.
