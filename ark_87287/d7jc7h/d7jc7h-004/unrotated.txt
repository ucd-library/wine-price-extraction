cause of seasonal demand, certain brands
c 1 1 1 ]

of popular scotch whisky become hard to

get. Aware of this, we have gone to excep

tional efforts to acquire a sufficient supply
of these scarce scotch whiskies sO that we
demands of our clientele

can please the
during

the pre-holiday season. Despite our
strong desire to make certain that you can
obtain the brand of your choice, in the
quantity that you wish, we know, from past
experience, that even our excellent inven-
tory position will be threatened by early
December. If you desire a particular brand
for gift giving, and you think it may fall
in the short supply category, our advice is

simple—order your Christmas needs early
