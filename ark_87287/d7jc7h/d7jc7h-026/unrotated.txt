RED WINE

691 MUSIGNY 1955 Estate Bottled, Hudelot
The magnificent wines of the Musigny vineyard are much
sought-after throughout the world. In our opinion, this

classic, velvety rarity will stand up against the noblest.

WHITE WINE

378 MEURSAULT, CUVEE
HUMBLOT, 1953 Hospices de Beaune

Acquired at the annual November auction of the Hospice
de Beaune. A graceful white Burgundy of true distinction.

Only 12 cases.

FEINE AUSLESE 1953, von Schorlemer

The name of von Schorlemer on the label automatically
results in a great Moselle. A ‘“‘Feine Auslese 1953’’ puts
it among the giants.

569 BRAUNEBERGER JUFFER AUSLESE

1953, von Schorlemer

During the 19th Century, Brauneberg was the most cele-
brated of the Moselles. Now, not quite as popular, it still
ranks with the greatest of the vineyards.

a 278 CHAMBERTIN 1955
Estate Bottled, Gen, Rebourseau
Here is ‘Le Grand Seigneur,” a title that Chambertin
carries gracefully. Amazing balance and fullness, classic
distinction—the proudest of the red Burgundies.

 

673 CHAMBERTIN MARION 1955
Y Estate Bottled, Pierre Gelin
Dr. Marion is one of the great surgeons of France and he
has spent much of his time in the vineyard. It is generally
agreed that his portion of acreage produces Chambertin of

the greatest finesse and bouquet. A collector’s item.

674 GRAND MONTRACHET 1955
Estate Bottled, J. Bavard

The ‘ne plus ultra’ of all French white wines is Le Mont-
rachet itself —an absolute maximum of 2000 cases a
year is produced by this single 18 acre plot owned by a
dozen proprietors. A glorious, much sought-after 1955.

1955, Estate Bottled, Dr. H. Thanisch
During our visit to Berncasteler Doctor last year, we were
particularly impressed by the superb quality that they
achieved during the 1955 vintage. Perhaps not as rich
or sweet as 1953, but surely the equal in class and dis-
