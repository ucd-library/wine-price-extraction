Here is one of America’s most remarkable spirits—12
Year Old JOHNNY REB, the reserve of a small country
distillery in Kentucky.

The number of barrels of 12 Year Old whiskey in exist-
ence is necessarily limited because of the serious loss
through evaporation—usually 50% during the twelve
years. However, the reward for patience is a whiskey
reminiscent of pre-prohibition classics—rich in flavor,
delicacy, bouquet and soft mellowness.

 

There is probably no better expression of the American
Distillers’ art presently available than JOHNNY REB,
made in the best American tradition in Kentucky. We
proudly offer this collector’s item to those seeking the
finest Bourbon obtainable today. Normally commands
+. $12.50 or more.
