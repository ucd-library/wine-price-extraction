n 384 B.C., Aristotle declared “sea water can be rendered potable by
distillation,” the idea for a future industry was born! A great many
a different forms of primitive distilling resulted in the centuries that
followed, but it was not until 1494, however, that a Scot, Friar John Cor
applied the art to barley and recorded “eight bolls of malt.” Although in
the early sixteenth century commercial distilling of a kind existed in Scot-
land, it was the nineteeth century that saw the establishment of the industry
with 87 distilleries. Today, blended Scotch Whisky is toasted around the
world and is particularly popular in America.

Fortnum & Mason have gone to considerate trouble in blending their Scotch
Whisky in order to obtain the richness, maturity and flavour, which has
resulted in this Whisky being a consistent favourite in London and elsewhere.
We ship only the most limited quantities of this precious spirit to our friends
SHERRY WINE & SPIRITS CO., INC. — but for

the discriminating Scotch drinker here is a

Scotch Whisky that easily surpasses many others

selling at considerably higher levels.

If SHERRY’S can spare a bottle or even

a case, we say, “Here’s to GOOD OLD

Whisky — drink it down.”
