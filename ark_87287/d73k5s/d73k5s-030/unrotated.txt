and the Harris family has one of the longest connections with the British
colony in Oporto. Their wines—both vintage and non-vintage enjoy
a superb reputation among Port-lovers in Britain. We are proud to in-
troduce them to the United States.

Why? Here is an estate-bottled Cognac that was produced during a great
vintage year—1949—in the most celebrated part of Cognac country—
‘Grande Fine Champagne’ It has remained in its unblended state in barrel
from its birth until the present date.

 

This utterly remarkable Cognac comes to us directly from M. Ragnaud.
Impeccable, authoritative, rich, fine.

These delicious, refreshing and celebrated Fruit Brandies are superb as after

warm and colorful, they are a true drinking experience.
