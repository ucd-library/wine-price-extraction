AMARONE Speri. ‘Recie’ are the “ears” of the grapes, those closest to the
sun at the top of the cluster. The grapes are semi-dried before pressing,
resulting in a distinguished red wine of incredible concentration and body.
Memorable.

Gaja. Recognized as one of the most successful and

Like Romanee-Conti, Brunello is the most unique, legendary

Monsecco. What Gaja is to Barbaresco, Monsecco is to Gattinara. A tiny
firm producing only 600 cases and where every wine is bottled and labelled
by hand. Elegantly rich but never heavy. Seductive.

Gaja. In 1969, Frank Schoonmaker wasso thrilled by this 1961 that he drove
all the way from Milan to Barbaresco to try and buy the entire production.
Signor Gaja regretfully declined. Now, 12 years later, the wine has become
even closer to perfection. Only 10 cases reached America—and then no
more.

Emilio Costanti. This vaunted, aristocratic wine, with its dry harmonious
flavor and extraordinary full bouquet, is always the most sought-after and
difficult to find.

CHIANTI 1979 © BIANCO 1980

The Marchesi de Frescobaldi whose ancestors were friends of Dante and
financial bankers of England’s Edward I and IJ, have been making wine
since the 14th century. Hanging in Florence’s Uffizi Gallery, is a 15th cen-
tury map showing the Frescobaldi vineyards as they were—and still are,
though much expanded. Grown in an ideal location, 400 metres above sea
level, the vines are rigorously pruned to control output and quality. The
results—this appealing CHIANTI 1979—young, light and balanced
—softer and more full-bodied than most other Chiantis twice the price.

The ancient house of Frescobaldi also sends us a white wine of distinc-
tion—BIANCO TOSCANO 1980, a fruity wine with a slightly greenish
tinge to complement its freshness. It is the joyous kind of wine to prelude
any meal. At a price so low, FRESCOBALDI BIANCO TOSCANO is
sheer perfection.
