WINES FROM LA VIEILLE FERME

We introduced LA VIEILLE FERME to America nine years ago. The
first wine was a dramatic Cotes du Rhone, which promptly became one
of the most sought-after red wines we have ever offered. In 1978 the
VIEILLE FERME family expanded with the arrival of a delightful red
from the Cotes du Ventoux (adjacent to the Rhone) anda delectably dry
Blanc de Blancs. The wines were so good—and the prices so low—that
hundreds of thousands of wine-lovers entered the large and happy band

of VIEILLE FERME admirers.
