& Presenting L A C AVE

The great wine caves of Europe are famed for encouraging the perfect
development of wine by guarding against the damaging effects of heat,
light, vibration, fluctuating humidity, odor and temperature variations. Re-
creating the conditions found in great wine caves, LA CAVE temperature-
controlled units can now perform this important function in your home.

Each LA CAVE unit provides an ideal environment for nurturing young
vintages and protecting those that are ready to drink by:

¢ maintaining an ideal, constant temperature of 52°-55° farenheit

¢ maintaining a humidity level of 60% to prevent cork drying

¢ eliminating strong odors which can permeate damp corks

e storing wines vibration-free

e shielding wines from light

LA CAVE wine storage units have been extremely successful in Europe
ever since their inception five years ago. Manufactured in France, these
ideal storage systems are now available in the United States, and have
already gained the respect of noted wine authorities for their unique excel-
lence in simulating true cellar conditions.

 

Each LA CAVE
unit is specially
ordered direct
from the manu-
facturer in France.
Please allow 3-5
weeks for delivery.
