CABERNET SAUVIGNON

ne FROM
RIDGE VINEYARDS

Recently Paul Draper, winemaker at Ridge Vine-

yards, travelled to New York to present a blind

SEEDER tasting of older vintages of Ridge’s Montebello
ee Cabernet Sauvignon.

CALIFORNIA
CABERNET
SAUVIGNON
YORK CREEK

 

As the wines were sipped, it was apparent to
everyone that Ridge has achieved something truly
extraordinary—a heritage of Cabernet Sauvignons of great concentration,
depth, and complexity. Admiration increased when the bottles were
unveiled, for it turned out that another wine had been included in the
tasting—several vintages of one of Bordeaux's greatest wines, Chateau

 

Latour.

The Ridge Cabernets stood up magnificently in competition with Latour,
which is very high praise indeed.

Those older vintages of Ridge have disappeared from the market. They are
collectors’ items, cherished in the cellars of those people foresighted enough
to buy them years ago. The wines we list below —a 1977 and a 1978 from the
vineyards at York Creek—are in the same grand Ridge tradition. Now is the
time to acquire them for your own cellar, so that you too, in future years,
will have the opportunity to taste the superb Cabernets of Ridge at their
perfect maturity.
