Fine wine deserves fine steware. Here is a selection of wine glasses designed by New York’s foremost wine
merchants, Sherry-Lehmann. Each glass is handblown and imported from Europe. Designed in the tradi-
tional manner, the generous rounded bowl allows for the maximum amount of air to be circulated in order

to let the wine ‘breathe’ and expand to its full potential.

Improved for 1981!

Here is the greatest contribution to wine since the invention of the
corkscrew. Since its introduction just over a year ago, the Screwpull has
already won over 100,000 converts. And now the impossible has been
done! The original Screwpull has been improved! The neck of this mag-
nificently simple device has been elongated to allow disgorging of even
the longest of corks, and holds the cork snugly once it has been extracted
from the bottle.

Terry Robards, noted wine editor of the New York Times, recently wrote
in his WINE TALK column, “Mr, Allen, a Texan, is a highly successful inven-
tor with some 300 patents in the oil field equipment [who] has advanced the
corkscrew in a quantum leap... The Screwpull comes closer to infallibility
then any other device for extracting corks, and it is so simple that anybody
can use it successfully... When I was invited recently to uncork a very old
expensive bottle of Chateau Lafite, | considered only one tool, the
Screwpull”

This is the only corkscrew you will ever need. Made of molded plastic
housing a teflon-like coated wire screw, the simplicity of its design and its
ease in handling will spoil you forever.
