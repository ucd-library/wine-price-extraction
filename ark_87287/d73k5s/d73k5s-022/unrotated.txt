Brouilly, Chateau de La Chaize 1979

The consistently high quality of this Grand Cru Beaujolais is no lucky acci-
dent. With extensive hillside vineyards in the village of Odenas, Chateau de
La Chaize.can proudly call its wine ‘Brouilly; one of the nine individual
‘growths’ that consistently produce the finest of Beaujolais. Unlike lesser ex-
amples, Chateau de La Chaize Brouilly is not bottled immediately after the
vintage, but in the Spring following the harvest when the added barrel age-
ing has brought out its full potential and unique longevity. In addition, the
property has been in the same family for three hundred years. The present
La Marquise de Roussy de Sales is a descendant of Pere La Chaize family
(the confessor of Louis XIV) who founded the estate in 1676. That generation
to generation of the family remains dedicated to the excellence of its wines,
is witnessed by the 1979 Brouilly . (4377)
