Vintage MADEIRA

From the

Last Century

“The very existence, let alone the sheer perfection, of these
old Madeiras, is an historic wine event—these 19th Century
Madeira have provided one of the great wine tasting expert-
ences of my life,” states James Beard.

Here is an unusual offering of five remarkable, authentic
19th Century Vintage Madeiras. Each bottle is signed by a
director of the impeccable firm of Blandy certifying that
the bottle contains a genuine Madeira of the vintage stated.
Most of these vintage Madeiras have disappeared from our
cellars. but these five thoroughbreds remain. We suggest
the acquisition of these precious bottles while they are on
sale during this period.

Pierre Poupon takes his wine growing seriously. He was weaned on the various ‘Vin
Roses’ in France, and resolved to provide an outstandingly fine Vin Rosé in Burgundy
using the classic Pinot Noir grape. The same variety used to produce Chambertin,
Musigny, Clos Vougeot, ete. Our tastings of this “Pinot Noir Rose 1964” gives strong
evidence that he has succeeded. The noble character of this grape and the Bur gundian
soil are reflected very clearly to the palate. Here is a pink wine of unusual class and
character completely dry and with distinguished bouquet. If you have found that
ordinary Vin Rosé lacked taste and interest, we urge that you try this one.
