It happened to us several months ago when we received the first samples of this
Champagne sent by NICOLAS OF PARIS, the most revered wine merchants of
France. We understood the enthusiasm of NICOLAS, because when we tasted the
wine we were quickly aware that here is a perfect and typical vintage ‘‘Blanc de
Blancs,” bone dry, elegant, truly dry and with great finesse.

Only last month it sold for $7.95 the bottle. At the current sale price of $5.99, it un-
doubtedly represents the best value in great vintage Champagne offered anywhere
in the United States. Quantity limited. This special offering ends April 15th
