CHATEAU GRAND PUY DUCASSE (Pauillac) 4,39
Some of the people who buy this great wine are adament about

laying it down for a few more years. Others are convinced

it's perfect pleasure now. We suggest you just decant it an

hour or two before serving. Grand Cru Classé in 1855.

| ab CHATEAU GRAND PONTET (St. Emilion) 4.99
ia

|

ND-PONTEI

Substantial savings for this top-flight

fi JON St. Emilion.

CLOS RENE (Pomerol) S29
Pomerols are not as well known here as they should be. Perhaps
this beauty will help start the right trend. Full, distinguished.

CHATEAU DUHART MILON ROTHSCHILD (Pauillac) 6.49
Duhart is now part of Baron Elie de Rothschild's domaine.
We can already taste the kinship with Lafite.

CHATEAU LYNCH BAGES (Pauillac) 7.99
Good price for this exceedingly popular wine. Needs another
five years to mature.

CHATEAU FIGEAC (St. Emilion) 8.75
Figeac's following continues to grow. Upon tasting this wine
you will understand why.

CHATEAU PAPE CLEMENT (Graves) 9.95
Ranks with La Mission Haut Brion and Domaine de Chevalier
as among Graves' finest.

VIEUX CHATEAU CERTAN  (Pomerol) 9.79

One of the great red wines of France.

CHATEAU LAFITE ROTHSCHILD (Pauillac) 20.95
Great years of Lafite are the backbone of every good wine

cellar. Lucky is the oenophile with enough foresight to

lay down some of this wine at so attactive a price.

CHATEAU MOUTON ROTHSCHILD (Pauillac) 21.95
A wine to cellar until the end of this century. Much power
and drama.

CHATEAU PETRUS (Pomerol) 25.95
Commands more than this in Bordeaux today. A classic claret
to treasure for decades.
