@ CADAUUAC pris BORDEAUX

Ronald Barton, the director of this famed property in St. Julien,
has told us of his particular pride in this superb 1970. The wine
is beautiful and will continue to improve for several more years.

From the wonderful 1970 vintage.

CHATEAU BEAUSEJOUR_ (St. Emilion)
Complex Grand Cru St. Emilion. Fine bouquet.

CHATEAU PICHON LALANDE (Pauillac)
The more feminine and elegant of the two great Pichon
chateaux. Much fruit and depth.

CHATEAU FIGEAC (St. Emilion)
A great St. Emilion. Possibly surpassed only by Cheval
Blanc. Just coming into its own.

CHATEAU HAUT BRION (Graves) -
The high standards of quality — as well as the demanding

centuries-old heritage — of Haut Brion have been enriched

by this remarkable wine. Considerable life ahead.
