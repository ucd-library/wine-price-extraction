CHATEAU LAFITE-ROTHSCHILD (Pauillac)

Blanche is a sizeable property, owned by

the renowned French wine merchants Barton

& Guestier. The quality they have made famous with all their
wines is readily apparent here - this is rich, honest, satisfying
wine expressing all the typical characteristics of a good Médoc.
1971, as we know, was an excellent vintage in Bordeaux. This
wine is now possessed of enough bottle age to show its full bouquet
and flavor. In addition, the price is astonishingly low - less than
$3 the bottle and less than $32 the case. Quite simply, no wine
bibber should be without a case or two of this wonderful wine.

 

 

CHATEAU RIPEAU (St. Emilion)
St. Emilions have a special place in the heart of every wine
drinker. The easy softness and quick-to-mature qualities are

always popular. This 1971 is just coming into its own. Grand
Cru Classé.
