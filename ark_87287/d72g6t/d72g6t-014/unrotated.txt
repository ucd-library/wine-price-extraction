Vintage MADEIRA
ae From the

Last Century

“The very existence, let alone the sheer perfection of these
vintage Madeiras, is an historic wine event—these 19th Century
Madeira have provided one of the great wine tasting experiences
of my life,” states James Beard.

Here is an unusual offering of four remarkable, authentic 19th
Century Vintage Madeiras. Each bottle is signed by a director of
the impeccable firm of Blandy certifying that the bottle con-
tains a genuine Madeira of the vintage stated. Most of these
vintage Madeiras have disappeared from our cellars, but these
four thoroughbreds remain. We suggest the acquisition of these
precious bottles w hile they are on sale during this period.
