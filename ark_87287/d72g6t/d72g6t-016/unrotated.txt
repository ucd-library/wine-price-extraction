S3 WISDOM’S
AMONTILLADO FINO . . .. 1.99 22.65

As this name implies, a good Amontillado belongs to the Fino family, but they
acquire certain different characteristics as they mature: the color becomes more
umber-like., As in the Finos. they are very dry, more nutty in flavor and develop
greater body. Here is a perfect example of fine Amontillado that normally com-
mands well over $3.00 the bottle.

$4 WISDOM’S
GOLDENCREAM. ... . 249 27.95

Generally speaking, a top-flight Cream Sherry such as this is the oldest and most
luxurious of the wines found in the Bodegas of Jerez. Usually, a fine Cream Sherry
of a reputable firm commands $5.00 or more the bottle. It is no ordinary event to
btain this medium dry, dramatically rich, wine for only $2.49. We urge that
you try it.
