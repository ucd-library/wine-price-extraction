246 CHATLAU DE MONTHELIE
Estate bottled, Suremain

Slightly more robust than Volnay, its immediate neighbor to the north,
the wines of Monthelie deserve to be better known among Burgundy
lovers. Try this out on your knowledgeable friends!

275 FIXIN, CLOS DU CHAPITRE
Estate bottled, Pierre Gelin

Here is the first great vineyard one encounters travelling into the
Cote D’Or of Burgundy, and a neighbor of Le Chambertin itself! Gelin
has produced here a wine of great flavor matched with elegance, which
has already become a favorite of several of our most discriminating
customers.

227 CORTON
Estate bottled, Senard
This vineyard, a prized legacy from Charlemagne dating back to 775,
produces wines thought to be the most brilliant in color of all Burgun-
dies. In a great year such as 1959, Le Corton is the equal of the great
wines of the Cote de Nuits—an aristocrat of unmatched pedigree.

393 CLOS DE LA ROCHE
Joseph Drouhin

4.39 48.50

The few acres that comprise this vineyard produce a superb wine of
great depth, one that manages to combine the richness of Chambertin
with the elegance of Musigny— its two neighbors to the north and south.

270 VOSNE ROMANEE, CLOS
DES REAS

Estate bottled, Louis Gros

The distinguishing characteristics of the great wines of Vosne are ling-

ering bouquet and rich, full character. In the masterful hands of Louis

Gros, Mayor of the town, the Clos de Reas vineyard has achieved a

delicacy and balance in this year that provides classic distinction.

801 BEAUNE, GUIGONE DE
SALINS a 5.99 65.95

Hospices de Beaune

Every November, when the Hospices de Beaune puts up its wines for
auction, those of the cuvee of Guigone de Salins (the wife of the man
who founded the Hospices) regularly outsell those of its neighbors. A
big wine, with the softness of a Beaune and the body and flavor of a
major Burgundy.

808 ECHEZEAUX

Estate bottled, Domaine de la Romanee Conti

7.85 85.00

The wines of the Domaine de la Romanee Conti reached a high point

in perfection during the 1959 vintage. We happily report that a few
cases of this majestic wine still remain.

1957 RED BURGUNDIES

354 CORTON, CLOS DU ROI
Estate bottled, Baron Thenard
The roi is Charlemagne but in the royalty of viniculture, Baron
Thenard outranks him here, as a grower of meticulous craftsmanship.
A truly noble wine, this Corton has a firmness of body balanced by a
soft finish and lingering bouquet.

308 GRANDS ECHEZEAUX

Estate bottled, Louis Gros

3.99 43.95

When the first °57’s proved to be slower to mature than had been
anticipated, they were forgotten in the rush of acclamation given to
the 1959’s. Here is a fine 57 that has come around, its bigness rounded
by time, ready to claim the honors it deserves.

 

649 QUINCY 1960 (Lapha)

21.95

Produced along the banks of the Cher, not far from the old city of
Bourges, this dry white wine is one of the best of the Loire.

431 SPARKLING VOUVRAY 1959

(Bredif) 4.99 54.95
It is generally acknowledged that the best sparkling wine of Vouvray
comes from the cellars of Marc Bredif. Fruitier than Champagne, it has
much finesse and charm

NEWS FROM CHAMPAGNE

Che new trend in drinking habits has been towards lightness. Aware of this, the highly respected Champagne firm of Krug have decided to do some-
thing about it. The decision was made six years ago—since then, Krug has set aside a special cuvee of the lightest and palest wine in their cellars. It is
now arriving in the United States for the first time—you will be delighted by its great delicacy, fragrant bouquet, and refreshing qualities. It is ideally
suited as an aperitif wine, and is wonderfully compatable for summer drinking. And we happily report that it is priced at a pleasantly low level.
