RED BORDEAUX ON SALE

 

In recent years, the price for the good red wines of Bordeaux have
soared to astronomic levels. We happily report, during a period
of world-wide inflation, the price clock has been turned back and
the cost of better red Bordeaux is dramatically less than it was a
year ago. Avail yourself of these unique sale opportunities.
