37A Your choice of
BENEDICTINE or ‘B and B’

The cry of ‘Eureka’ filled the air about the year 1510 at
a Benedictine monastery in Fécamp, France. It was dur-
ing that period that Dom Bernardo Vincelli discovered
the secret of making ‘Benedictine’ which was designed
to fortify and restore the spirits of the weary monks.
Shortly thereafter, this delicious liqueur found favor with
Francis | who discovered it when he passed through the
region in 1534.
During the 19th Century, the formula fell into the hands
Available at ih of Monsieur Alexandre Le Grand and his family have
milder 86° at 8 since been trusted to preserve the formula. The eccle-
the bottle siastical inscription D.O.M, which means ‘Deo Optimo
ape Maximo’ still is carried on every bottle of both ‘Benedic-
Below $88.36 tine’ and ‘B and B’.

FROM SCOTLAND
A 12 yr. old thoroughbred

During the Yuletide, there is an
observable tendency on the
part of the Scotch drinker to
move away from his year-round
favorite and participate in the
satisfying taste luxury of drink-
ing one of the older whiskies
of Scotland. This becomes par-
ticularly meaningful when a de-
cision is being made as to what
brand of Scotch should be sent
to an appreciative friend as a
gift.

When such a decision has to
be made, many of our clientele
quickly turn to BALLANTINE’S
12 YEAR OLD:

Despite its rich flavor, it still
retains sufficient lightness—the
blend is completely rounded,
and there are no raw edges to
be detected. Highly recom-
mended. (Below 102.00 case)

SHERRY

DRY SACK

The word ‘Sack’ was a
favorite expression in
Elizabethean days. The
word ‘Dry’ is a favorite
expression today.

The combination of the
two gives you DRY SACK
—the Sherry that is an
acknowledged favorite in
Spain, England, and
America. Rich in flavor,
dry—but not too dry. Try
it ‘on-the-rocks’.
