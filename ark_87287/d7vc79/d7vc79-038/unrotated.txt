AMBASSADOR
8 YEAR OLD SCOTCH

Represents a beautiful
combination of light-
ness and maturity re-
sulting from itsed
years of age. Will be
particularly appreci-
ated as a Christmas
gift. (Below 81.26 the

LA DOUCETTE case.)
POUILLY-FUME 1969 Below 6.99

The most sought after
white wine of the Loire
Valley. If you have never
experienced the delicacy,
fruit and flavor of the
Pouilly-Fumé 1969 pro-
duced by de Ladoucette,
we urge that you do so
at once. Here is the very
wine featured so consist-
ently by the better French
restaurants of America.
Sheer delight. (46.35 the
case.) 4.29
