This is not the regular 12 Year Old Smith’s Glen-
livet, but part of their remarkable 18 Year Old
reserve. Only 25 cases of this great rarity are
available—and then no more! ‘‘The Glenlivet” dis-
tillery is the first legally recognized Scotch maker
in Scotland. When you drink this remarkable 18
Year Old 91 Proof whisky straight, you are dealing
almost with an essence, untouched and unblended

in a single cask. It is not heavy, but delicate—it
can be served in a Cognac snifter and will easily
pass the test.

We urge that you acquire at least a few bottles,
while available, either to give an appreciative
Scotch drinking friend this Christmas—to add dis-
tinction to your own holiday dinner parties.
