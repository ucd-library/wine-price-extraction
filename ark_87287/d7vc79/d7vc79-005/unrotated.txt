Sensational Sale —The Best of Beaujolais From the Cellars of
mY RT ns

THE RT. HON. ERNEST MARPLES
Provides the best of Beaujolais
—Making Possible this Offering

WHO IS THE RT. HON. ERNEST
MARPLES? Why do we offer his wines
so proudly? Certainly, many of us are
aware that he was a favorite disciple
of Sir Winston Churchill; that he won
national fame as Minister of Transport
when he was in the British Cabinet;
and he won renown as the man who
‘“‘made London traffic work.’’ However,
few of us are aware that he is an im-
portant vineyard owner in the Beaujo-
lais district and an authority on the
wines of the Beaujolais countryside.

The bottles of red and white wine that
proudly bear the name of the RT. HON.
ERNEST MARPLES have now become
respected throughout America and
much appreciated by discriminating
wine drinkers throughout the world.
All the wines offered here are truly
outstanding within their class — the
prices at which they are being offered
are not just low, but fantastically so.

Can you think of a more imagina-
tive and economical christmas
gift than 12 superb bottles in the
handsome, useful Marples Wine
Rack? — ONLY $29.75.
Quantity limited —
suggest ordering promptly.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

    
 
 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

  
  
     

Red Wines of the Great 1969 & 1970 Vintage

SALE PRICE
No. Bottle Case

316° BEAU JOLAIS ? 1910 oF eee or re 22.50

The most popular and best loved wine of France at astonishingly low cost. The 1970 vintage
is relatively light, utterly charming, especially when served cool. The Rt. Hon. Ernest Marples
did well when he selected this beauty from a vineyard owned by M. Jambon.

386 BEAUJOLAIS VILLAGES 1970. . . . 2.19 24.50

From one of the 35 outstanding villages of Beaujolais, with more depth, alcohol and flavor
than the more basic Beaujolais listed above. From a proud estate owned by M. Goudard.

SSC 7sRROEILLY U0 . 1 3s a eee ee 33.95

Brouilly is one of the nine great townships of Beaujolais and the wine that it produces has
always been among our favorites. Rich in fruit and charm. From the estate of M. Nesmes.

250: .. MOULIN-A-VENTH1969).0 <at doce bas eee 33.95

Burgundy has its Chambertin and Clos de Vougeot. Beaujolais has its “Moulin-a-Vent’”—
far and away the best red wine growing area of the Macon—and always the most expensive.
This wine will live long—at least eight years of fruit and sturdiness lie ahead.

White Wines of the Great 1970 Vintage

416.2° MAEGON BLANG LUGNY 1970 2 sce os oa oe 22.50

Dry white wine not readily distinguishable from its neighbor. Pouilly-Fuissé. An outstanding
wine and “best buy.” Ideally suited for those who want to serve a good dry white burgundy
to accompany holiday menus at a price that does not make too serious a dent in the family
budget.

AO0” POUTELY-FUISSE 1970 44.4 “9 eee 36.95
The price of Pouilly-Fuissé at the vineyard has almost doubled. Good for another five years.
An outstanding, dry clean example grown by M. Chaleard.
