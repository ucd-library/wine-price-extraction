The 1970 white Burgundies proved elegant graceful, fruity, of exce F

wine comes from a ‘Premier Cru’ vineyard which command
substantially higher prices. The grower in this instance is
Robert Vocoret, the Mayor of Chablis, who is renowned for
the excellence of his wine, particularly when gathered in
such an outstanding year as 1970. We can state that if this
wine were permitted to bear the name it rightfully deserves,
it would command double this price.

was much variation in quality from vineyard to vineyard in

the 1967 vintage. Here are two outstanding examples of top-flight

SHERRY-LEHMANN, INC. - 679 Madison Avenue. N. Y. 10021 TEmpleton 8-7500

CORTON CHARLEMAGNE ............ 8.25 89.10
This vineyard, the steepest in all of Burgundy, produces a
dry white wine that is often compared to Montrachet. Estate-
bottled, Le Leure Piot.

MONTRACHET, LAGUICHE . 19.88 214.65
Rabelais always referred to this wine as “the divine Montra-
chet,” and Dumas proclaimed that “it should be drunk kneel-
ing and bareheaded.” The nobility of Burgundy has no
higher royalty than “le Montrachet,” generally considered
to be the greatest dry white wine of the world. The one
produced by Marquis Laguiche is considered the ‘King’ even
within this exalted company.
