THE WINES OF
GERMANY

All wine experts agree that the best German wines are superb, and
are possibly among the best white wines of the world. Even the less
expensive ones are charming and have finesse.

The latitude of the German vineyards extend as far north as Labra-
dor. Grapes struggle to survive, but when they do, they are superb.
The most important areas are the vineyards that overlook the Rhine
and Moselle Rivers. We take these wines sufficiently seriously to
offer you, after many visits and tasting, those that we consider the
best of Germany.

SALE OFFERING
OF 1970 RHINES & MOSELLES

EVERYONE IS TALKING about 1970 on the Rhine and Moselle.
We have gone to great effort to see that the ’70s would be shipped
express, so they would be here in time to add their freshness, fruit,
and good cheer to your winter entertaining.

The growers along the Rhine and Moselle rivers are rightfully happy
with their 1970 crop. It is true that they did not produce too many
peak wines in the exalted ‘Auslese’ and ‘Beerenauslese’ class—
however, this was more than compensated for by a bounteous crop
of truly superb, typical and well-balanced regionals and the less
complex estate-bottlings. After all, it is these less costly and less
sweet German wines that have proven most popular in America.

All of these represent regional wines at their best and come from an
impeccable source, HANS KENDERMANN. Mr. Kendermann is
recognized in Germany as an outstanding authority, never compro-
mising with quality. All of these wines are ON SALE. Our advice is
simple—if you are interested in acquiring authentic and excellent
Rhines and Moselles at low sale price to fortify your holiday menus,

NOW IS THE TIME to acquire them.
