1966 CHATEAU BOTTLED
A great, great claret year and a worthy successor to the classic 1961s.
There is every indication that the prices will surge upwards within
the year because of the relative failure of the 1968s and the astro-

nomically high opening prices that the 1969 and 1970 clarets have

commanded on the Bordeaux market.

CHATEAU MALESCOT

ST. EXUPERY 3.99 13.10
Paul Zuger, the proprietor, has brought this Margaux vine-
yard to its ultimate potential and we are dealing with a wine
that is worth much more than this price—largely because it
is not as well publicized as its neighbors but surely equals
them in quality.

CHATEAU BOUSCAUT 4.49 48.50
Delightful Graves. Ready now, with good life ahead.
CHATEAU PICHON LALANDE 4.79 51.75
A Pauillac that reached exalted heights in 1966.
CHATEAU CALON SEGUR 1.99 53.90

A St. Estephe that is starting to show its greatness.
CHATEAU COS D’ESTOURNEL 1.99 53.90
St. Estephe reaches exalted heights here.
CHATEAU BEYCHEVELLE 5.69 61.45
A St. Jylien no longer available on the Bordeaux market.
CHATEAU LEOVILLE LASCASES 5.79 62.55
Like Beychevelle, will soon disappear from market.
CHATEAU LA MISSION

HAUT BRION 8.95 96.65
A glorious Graves with 20 years of development ahead.
CHATEAU PALMER 8.95 96.65
In Pomerol. it is Petrus that is hard to come by—in Margaux,
‘tis Chateau Palmer. Elegance and balance are amazing here.
CHATEAU MOUTON

BARON PHILIPPE 9.49 102.49
Adjacent to Mouton Rothschild, and the same proprietor.
CHATEAU AUSONE 10.50 114.15
Relatively low price for a great First Growth St. Emilion.
CHATEAU HAUT BRION 13.95 150.65
Great distinction, power and finesse. The perfect wine for

laying down.

CHATEAU MARGAUX 13.95 150.65
Margaux. Another First Growth glory.

CHATEAU LATOUR 13.95 150.65
A Pauillac that is destined to outlive us all.

CHATEAU CHEVAL BLANC 13.95 150.65

The jewel of St. Emilion. Hard to come by.
CHATEAU LAFITE ROTHSCHILD. 17.50 189.00
Perhaps the most famous red wine vineyard of the world.
CHATEAU MOUTON

ROTHSCHILD 17.50 189.600
Truly distinguished and great. Rare now will be unavail-

able in another two years.

 

 
 

1964 CHATEAU BOTTLED

One of the better years of our generation. Most of the wines are
ready for present drinking, but the great vineyards may require an-
other year of bottle age.

Bottle Case
CHATEAU MAISON BLANCHE 2.19 23.65

A discovery in the mountains of St. Emilion.

CHATEAU CAPET 2.49 26.90
A superior chateau-bottling of St. Emilion. Now has suffi-
cient bottle age to make it outstanding in taste and in value.
Should you pull the cork and taste it, we suspect you will
come back for more, again and_,again.

CHATEAU BELGRAVE. ...... 3.49 37.70
Classified among the five great growths in 1855. Vineyard
lies on the boundary line of St. Julien. Beautiful example of
outstanding Medoc at relatively modest cost.

CHATEAU CLOS FOURTET........... 3.99 46.75
A Grand Cru St. Emilion. Similar in its taste qualities to a
Chateau Cheval Blane, but a bit lighter. The price is aston-
ishing because this wine costs more than this in Bordeaux
on a trade level today. Also available in Magnums at 8.56,
49.75 the case of six.

CHATEAU DUHART MILON

ROTHSCHILD .......... 3.99 46.75
A Pauillac adjacent to Lafite Rothschild, and owned by
Baron Eli de Rothschild. Because of the excellence of the
wine produced at this vineyard, Baron de Rothschild, has
chosen to now call the wine ‘Chateau Duhart-Milon Roths-
child” We now understand why. We have tasted this 1964
many times and it is utterly astonishing and in its own quiet
way can compete with the very best vineyards of Pauillac.
Shipment delayed by dock strike, available for delivery
spring 1972. Its true greatness justifies anticipating
your future needs at this dramatically low price.
CHATEAU DE SALES 2... 3.99 46.75
A prime example of Chateau-bottled Pomerol is not easy to
come by, particularly at only $3.99 the bottle. A beauty.
CHATEAU BOUSCAUT.................... 4.49 48.50
A Grand Cru Graves of unusual distinction. This 1964 ready
now.
CHATEAU TALBOT —2....... 5.99 64.70
An 1855 classified St. Julien that generally commands among
the highest prices in Bordeaux other than the First Growths.
Big, full-bodied, yet soft. Exceptional.

CHATEAU LATOUR 13.50 145.80
Pauillac. Great life ahead.
CHATEAU MARGAWX ..................-. 14.95 161.45

Elegance and finesse are distinguishing characteristics.

CHATEAU CHEVAL BLANC............ 14.95 161.45
Chateau bottled St. Emilion at its best.
CHATEAU HAUT BRION ................ 14.95 161.45

Possibly the greatest of the 64s. Should be acquired now.
CHATEAU MOUTON

ROTHSCHILD ........3 19.50 210.60
Rich, full, great.
CHATEAU LAFITE ROTHSCHILD 19.50 210.60

Has now become very rare. Outstanding.

1962 CHATEAU BOTTLED

Quietly, and with a minimum of publicity, the perfect 1962 clarets
are beginning to be appreciated by connoisseurs. Quick to mature,
here are the kind of clarets that can be enjoyed today and for several
years ahead.

196

CHATEAU LE CAUZE |... 2.49 26.90

Emilion. Bottled by Nicolas.

CHATEAU DUHART MILON.......... 4.49 48.50
A Pauillae adjacent to Chateau Lafite Rothschild, sharing
the same proprietor, Baron Eli de Rothschild. Worth much
more.

A St. Julien of depth and distinction. Bottled by Nicolas.
CHATEAU FIGEAC 5.49 59.30
