Each Can Be Poured Separately Out of the
Same 2 Compartment Bottle! 14B

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
   

There is beauty, func-

tional usefulness, and
‘ high excellence in this
two-headed Benedictine
creation.

In addition to its amusing
effect as a gift, it has the
practical virtue of permit-
ting you to serve the ex-
cellent Benedictine —and
for those who want it a bit
dryer, you are in a posi-
tion to immediately pour
the B & B, a combina-
tion of Benedictine and
brandy.
