THE WINES OF SPAIN

There is more vineyard land in Spain than in any other country in
the world—less than 3% is Sherry. The best table wines are from
Rioja and some good ones are produced in Valdepenas—also spot-
tily in a few other provinces. Look for the old vintage wines of
Rioja which are among the best values in outstanding red wine ex-

tant today.

673 BANDA AZUL 1967 . 1.49 16.50

Ernest Hemingway enjoyed visiting the cellars of Paternina
from where this wine comes. Look for earthy lustiness,
honesty and depth of flavor. A ‘best buy.’

889 SANT-GRIA, YAGO 1.59 17.28
If you do not want to go through the effort of buying one of
these Spanish red wines to make your own Sangria by adding
fruit juice, sugar syrup, and sparkling water, you can solve
the problem of buying this excellent prepared Sangria—now
becoming a national best-seller. Simply pour into a pitcher,
filled with ice, add cut fruit, club soda and serve.

190 TINTO 1967 ee 1.69 18.50
Produced by Rene Barbier, a rece h family that started to
grow wines almost a century ago in the Pinados region of
Catalonia, among the hills of Barcelona.

527 GRAN RESERVA 1959 2.49 26.90
As in Bordeaux, 1959 was a great year in Rioja. From private
reserves of Paternina.

THE WINES OF THE
ARGENTINE

The Argentine is the largest wine-producing and wine-consuming
country of the western hemisphere. The per capita consumption is
over 75 bottles! In America, it is about eight bottles. No great wines
are produced, but The San Felipe vineyard produces an entirely

delightful red wine here. Rich in flavor and balance. Interesting.
