1963 VINTAGE

Far from a banner year in Burgundy, 1963 did turn out some
astonishing surprises. The most startling of these come from that
glittering jewel of Burgundy—the Domaine of Romanee Conti. The
Domaine undertook extensive spraying of their wines—14 times in
all—which alleviated the problem of rot suffered so widely else-
where. In addition, they gambled on the harvest, waiting two weeks
after most other growers had picked, and reaped the benefits of
steady sunshine during that period. In short, we are dealing with
wines which are ready to drink now and can hold their heads high

in the best of company. Outstanding examples of superb craftsman-
ship in wine-making.

AUXEY-DURESSES, DURESSES 3.99 43.10
We share the opinion of André Surmain of the Lutece Res-
taurant who believes this relatively unknown Burgundy
represents the best value for those who want outstanding
wine at relatively modest cost. Estate-bottled, René Roy.
VOLNAY CHAMPANS 4.49 48.530

the best of the Pommards. A discovery. Estate-bottled,
Marquis d’Angerville.

yard is only 17 acres in size. We doubt that 100 cases remain
undrunk throughout the world. Estate-bottled, Camus.

1959 VINTAGE

If the °59 red Burgundies are properly selected, they are not simply
good, but dramatically great for present drinking, exhibiting great
charm, warmth, balance and delicacy.

CHAMBOLLE-MUSIGNY 11.50 125.00
The estate of the late Dr. Albert Barolet yielded this remark-
able 1959.

CHAMBERTIN, CLOS DE BEZE 12.50 135.00
To obtain a ‘Chambertin Clos de Beze’ of the 1959 vintage
is no small wine accomplishment. From the cellars of Paul
Bouchard.

ROMANEE ST. VIVANT 12.50 135.00
The Domaine de la Romanée-Conti now controls most of this
vineyard. It adjoins Romanée-Conti and Richebourg. Pierre
Poupon, one of the world authorities on the wines of Bur-
gundy, acquired a small quantity from a portion of the vine-
yard not owned by Domaine Romanée-Conti.
