FRENCH SPARKLING WINES

The name ‘Champagne’ is guarded jealously in France and only
sparkling wines produced in the strictly delimited Champagne dis-
trict are entitled to bear the name. However, some intriguing spark-
ling wines, without the name ‘Champagne’ are made in other parts
of France, particularly the Loire and Rhone Valleys and in the
mountainous countryside of the Haut-Savoie.

$1 BOYER BRUT 1967 3.99 43.10

and dramatically low price. Young, fresh, bone-dry. Made of

SPARKLING “COLD DUCK”

What is ‘Cold Duck’? We know it is a blend of sparkling red and
sparkling white wine that has become a current fad in much of

ling Coca-Cola’ which is an integral part of the American scene.

ALSATIAN WINES

The choicest vineyards of Alsace are on the slopes of the Vosges

Mountains starting from Mulhouse continuing north to Strasbourg.

The Alsatian wines are usually named after the grape from which

they are made such as Sylvaner, Riesling, Gewurztraminer, etc. Their

distinguishing characteristics are flowery fragrance, relatively dry.
but fruity.

689 SYLVANER 1970 1.69 18.25

menus and for ‘spritzers.’ Note low price. Caves Hanhart.
