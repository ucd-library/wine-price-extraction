THE COUNTRY WINES

OF FRANCE

Here are the local ‘vin du pays’ wines of France that bring so much

joy to

tourists who explore the French countryside. Each has its own

personality, its own message, its own touch of charm. They were not
easy to come by since many of the growers are not export-minded.
Undoubtedly, you have heard about some of them, have read of their
virtues in literature—and we happily bring them to you.

CORBIERES CHAINTRUEL 1.49 16.50

Nicolas sends us this excellent red wine grown on the rolling
hills of Carcassonne.

PROVENCE ROUGE 1970 1.69 18.25
Nicolas, the famed Parisian wine merchants, buy this wine
in vast quantities and get the best. Their purchasing savings
are passed on to you.

FITOU (Pyrenees) ......... - 1.79 19.35
No vintage appears on the label, but it is actually a 1969—
the best red wine of the French Midi. Full-bodied, vigorous.

LES BAUX ROUGE 1968...... 2.29 24.75
Estate-bottled at Mas de la Dame vineyard, residence of
Mr. Faye, President of the company that produces Cinzano,
Dubonnet, Cusenier and Pernod. His personal pride is re-
flected in the wine.
GAMAY DE SAVOIE 1970....... 2.49 26.90
Gamay, the grape of Beaujolais, takes on an interesting new
character when grown on the slopes of the Alps.
IRANCY 1969 (Burgundy)............ 2.69 29.05
Irancy is a village 10 miles southwest of Chablis in northern
Burgundy. It is fresh, delightful, and should be served
slightly cool.
CAPOUS 1967: oe 2.79 30.15
Interesting legendary red wine grown north of Toulouse, and
not far from the famed medieval Chateau de Mercués. Dark
crimson in color, long-lived, similar to a full-bodied red wine
in Graves. Estate-bottled, Parnac.
BOUZY ROUGE 1966

(Still Champagne) ...................... 5.99 64.70
Extraordinary red wine made from the Pinot Noir grape on
Champagne soil. Hard to come by, because the superior wine
produced in the village of Bouzy usually goes into the best
of Champagnes. A favorite in Paris—a rarity in America.
Estate-bottled, Domaine Vesselde.

PROVENCE ROSE 1969................. 1-69 18.25
A spritely pink grown near Mediterranean. Nicolas.
CABERNET ROSE 1969.................. 1.79 19.35

Produced in the Anjou area of the Loire Valley, made from
the superior Cabernet grape, providing more depth and
flavor than the average Anjou Rose. Nicolas.

LIRAC ROSE 1969 oe 1.99 21.50
This estate-bottling by Domaine Closel recently won the
First Gold Award at the Paris fair as the best within its class.
The vineyard is adjacent to Tavel, made of the same Gre-
nache grape, and is quite undistinguishable from Tavel itself.
This one is an absolute beauty.

TAVEL ROSE 1970................ oe eee 26.90
No ordinary Tavel this one, it is estate-bottled by M. Bernard.
It is of the current 1970 vintage, its youth retaining its color,
fruit and freshness. Because the soil is arid and rocky, the
yield per acre is small, resulting in more flavor and bouquet
than is usually associated with a rosé.

CASTEL ROUBINE .......... ee 2.49 26.90
Estate-bottled at outstanding vineyard in Provence. Con-
sidered the best rosé of area.
ROSE DE SANCERRE 1970
Amazing rosé from town of Sancerre in Loire. Est
V. Delaporte.

BOURGOGNE ROSE 1969... . 269 29.05
Made from Pinot Noir grape on Marsanay soil. Perhaps the
best rosé of all France. Estate-bottled, André Bart.

a dry white wine of much finesse, delicacy and balance. Un-
heralded because his wine is relatively unknown, it provides
a low cost discovery for the more adventuresome of wine
lovers.

THE LOIRE VALLEY

The Loire meanders for over 600 miles through France and wine is
grown along its banks from the Atlantic Ocean almost up to Lyon.
Because of the vast area, Loire wines include a wide and interesting
diversity of both whites and reds ranging from the acceptable to the
outstanding. Here are the best.

wine still sells under the slogan “Le tigre en buvait aussi.”

The birthplace of Rabelais yields a light, fresh red wine.
Best when young. Most consumed locally. Try it lightly
chilled—delightful. Estate-bottled, Rutheil-Couly.

Astonishing price for a dry white Loire of this estate-bottled

calibre. Lovingly grown and bottled by Savennieres.
