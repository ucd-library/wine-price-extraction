M-30A CHATEAU LA MISSION HAUT BRION

(Graves) 92.50

Woltner Freres, the proprietors, were the last to quote on
the Bordeaux market, and the price has just reached us. It
isn’t inexpensive, but since it competes in intrinsic excellence
with Ist growths, it is well worth the price. Distinguishing
characteristics are balance, finesse—the superb flavor of
Graves, and longevity. A classic claret.

M-32 CHATEAU LATOUR (Pauillac) 159.00
Full-bodied, firm, but with exceptional softness in 1970. Will
live for decades.

M-37 CHATEAU HAUT BRION (Graves) 159.00
Very big, full; power, combined with elegance. Undoubtedly,
the best Graves produced in 1970—in the same exalted
league as Lafite, Mouton and Latour. Now is the time to
acquire this great, great claret.

M-31 CHATEAU PETRUS (Pomerol) 199.00
Because of health of Merlot grapes, Chateau Petrus 1970 may
well be the best Petrus produced in the last two decades.

Only 16 acres—hard to come by. Dramatic velvetyness—a
glory.
M-36 CHATEAU MOUTON ROTHSCHILD
(Pauillac) 199.00

Baron Philippe de Rothschild is proud of the bigness, power,
and beautiful balance of his 1970 Mouton—certainly one of
the greatest of his post-war years.
M-35 CHATEAU LAFITE-ROTHSCHILD

(Pauillac) 2. Ge ee ee 199.00
We have watched the Lafite 1961 and 1959 climb to the $500
per case mark and beyond. Given another decade, the same
astronomic climb will surely happen to Lafite 1970.

SANS-ANNEE

These two wines should not be overlooked. The Simplet is beauti-
fully balanced and a delight. The Chateau Bahans Haut Brion was
grown at the famed Chateau Haut Brion vineyard and is a blend of
the 1964 and 1965 vintages. Extraordinary opportunity for those who
want truly outstanding wine at relatively modest cost.
