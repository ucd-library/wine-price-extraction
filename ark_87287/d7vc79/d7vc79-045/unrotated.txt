“The very existence, let alone the sheer per-
fection, of these Madeiras is an historic wine
event—these 19th Century and early 20th Cen-
tury Madeiras have provided one of the great

James Beard.

breds are gone, the opportunity to taste authen-
tic old vintage Madeiras of this caliber will be
lost forever.
