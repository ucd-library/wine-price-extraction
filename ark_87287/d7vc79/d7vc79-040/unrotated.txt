NOILLY PRAT

The classic dry Vermouth by which all other vermouths
are judged. Noilly Prat is pale, extra dry, and of impec-
cable origin. The favorite throughout the world for dec-
ades. The ideal companion for the Dry Martini—excellent
on-the-rocks with a twist of lemon peel—or mix with a bit
of Cassis for a splendid ‘Vermouth-Cassis.’ (29.70 case.)
