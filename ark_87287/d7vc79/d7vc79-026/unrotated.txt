a true dramatic glory

BEERENAUSLESE AND

TROCKENBEERENAUSLESE
BEERENAUSLESE means that individual grape berries have been
selected for their over-ripeness at the time of the picking. The most
perfect and ripest bunches are set aside and pressed separately—a
selection, not of bunches, but of single grapes cut from the bunches
by hand with scissors. They are always sweet, but never cloying,
with a tremendous amount of bouquet, fruit, and flavor. Should be
served only with dessert, or after dinner for a fabulous tasting
experience.

TROCKENBEERENAUSLESE is on an even more exalted level
since not only are the grapes picked individually by scissors, but
they are left on the vines until they are so ripe that they are dry
(trocken), or have almost become raisins. Fabulous, expensive, great,
