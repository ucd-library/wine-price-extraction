BROUILLY, CHATEAU DE

LA CHAIZE 2.99 32.30
The Brouilly 1970, estate-
bottled at Chateau de La
Chaize, has outsold any
other wine in our history.
Perhaps it is because it
won the Gold Award at
the Paris Fair; or it might
be that everyone loves it
and comes back for more

 

—whatever the reason, we

 

happily report that a new
Propuce wi ERANCE f, shipment has recently
: reached us, just in time to
avoid the necessity of our
imposing the 10% import
surcharge.
The Chateau de La Chaize vineyard, in the famed wine
growing district of Brouilly, has been maintained, from
father to son, for over four centuries by the Marquis de
Roussy de Sales family. Since every bottle comes from the
estate, and no more remains in France, we urge that you
order promptly to avoid disappointment.
Chateau de La Chaize is also available in the useful 18 oz.
PICHET size—much bigger than a half-bottle and two-thirds
of the regular bottle. The ideal size for dinner for two. The
Pichets are available at $2.19, each, $23.65 the case of 12.
BEAUJOLAIS CHENAS 2.79 30.15
A superb Beaujolais, estate-bottled at the Domaine Laneyrie,
produced in Chenas, one of the nine great wine growing
villages of Beaujolais. Outstanding.
BEAUJOLAIS JULIENAS 2.99 32.30
Estate-bottled, Domaine Laneyrie. Rich in fruit and flavor
superb.

1969 VINTAGE

At the Hospices de Beaune auction of the 1969 vintage in Burgundy

305 barrels were bid

one half the normal quantity. The prices were

the highest in history, reflecting the intrinsic excellence of the wine.
Now. almost two years after that famous auction, the 1969 Burgundies

are beginning to arrive in this country and it is apparent that those
who bought early were extremely fortunate. The wines are big, deep,
and very long-lived in the classical style of great Burgundies. They
will equal, if not surpass in quality the 1961 vintage the greatest of
the past decade. Due to scarcity, we can project that these wines will
be selling at astronomical ‘price levels two-three years from now if,
indeed. they are available at all. We strongly urge Burgundy lovers
to consider acquiring the classic 1969 Burgundies now, while avail-
ability remains. Because of the uncertainty caused by the dock
strike, our vast array of great 1969 red Burgundies have been de-
ferred for shipment until the Spring of 1972. Those listed below are
available for immediate delivery to those who want to experience

the greatness of 1969 Burgundies.
