spent almost a half-century travelling throughout the world and collect-

ing wine lists from everywhere. I know of no other list in existence that

rand y 5 a a matches this one if judged by width of range, discriminating selection,
. Op) 5 and realistic prices. Whether the standard be day-in and day-out jug wine,

wines for laying down, rarities from previous decades, the choicest exam-

ples from the leading wine-growing areas of the world—all are included.

Ou  % § The wisdom of over three decades of tasting, learning, comparing, is re-
e Vineyards We i‘ | flected here. I extend my congratulations to Sam and Michael Aaron for

€d to detour ty the ‘\ the creative joy that they have brought to the wine lovers of America.”
