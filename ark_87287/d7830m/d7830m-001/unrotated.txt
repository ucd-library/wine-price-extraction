Among the great non-European
wines of the world must be
classed the red and white wines
of Chile. Here are exceptional
examples offered at an astonish-
ingly low price — quantity
limited and irreplaceable.

RED WINE

Here is Chile’s excellent red wine that can be served freely
and with the pleasurable knowledge that the cost is hardly
more than beer. In the traditional squat Bocksbeutel.

WHITE WINE

  

  

Chile’s dry white wine in the interesting squat bottle at
astonishingly low cost. An excellent choice for the
“Spritzer” days ahead.

 

We have searched long and hard
for a pleasing red and white
wine to sell under $1.00 the bot-
tle. We know of no more pleas-
ing examples available than the
red and white Bordeaux of Boyer
Freres.
