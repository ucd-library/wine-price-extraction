remarkable 1961 red Burgundies, destined to be the most
long lived of our generation, have now reached our cellars,
bringing their extraordinary depth of flavor, roundness and
noble character to you—and each is priced at its low acqui-
sition cost, and not its current higher replacement value.

If you want to drink great red Burgundy NOW, aglow
with fruit and charm, drink the fabulous 1959s which you
see on the following pages—they will be most ready, and
dominate the scene for the immediate. If your taste runs to
Burgundies that have more depth, and therefore will need
more bottle age, acquire the 1961s now, while they are
available, keep them in your cellar for a while, and the
reward will be great in the future—that day when you pull
the cork and you experience a wine that is sure to be one of
Burgundy’s noblest.

I have known Burgundians who have stated, “La Grand Rue” is the best
vineyard soil of the entire Cote d’Or. This may be open to question. But the

least that can be said of this wine is)that it is a giant, entirely remarkable, and
