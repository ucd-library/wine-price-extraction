Happy harmony of austere dryness combined with fruit. The kind of young fresh

502 BERNCASTELER DOCTOR

SPATINGE § <%=.) 4:79 S2.io
Estate bottled, Dr. H. Thanisch

The ‘“‘ne plus ultra” of all Moselle vineyards. Note low sale price. The 1960 in
a great vineyard like ‘‘Doctor” is much better than neighboring ones.

Near Trier, through the coldest wine country of Germany, flows the
Saar, a tributary of the Moselle. In great years when there is much
sunshine, as in 1959, there are generally finer than the other great
Moselles. Many wine lovers consider the Scharzhofbergers of 1959
among the finest white wines of our lifetime.
