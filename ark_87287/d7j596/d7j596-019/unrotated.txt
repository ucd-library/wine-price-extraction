Great 1959:

We are offering a collection of 1959 Clarets on this page—
though they may appear expensive, they are, nevertheless,
phenomenally low in light of present replacement cost. But
we must assert, they are truly great, perhaps not as long-lived
as the 1961s—but they are wines of class, charm, and most can

be consumed today with much enthusiasm, and pleasure. Here SALE PRICE
