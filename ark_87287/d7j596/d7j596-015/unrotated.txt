The American Champagnes produced in the Finger Lakes district of New York State generally command over $4.00 the bottle. We will
match this one, beautifully made and delightfully dry, with any of them, and at only $2.79. With the cost as low as this, you can serve
Champagne with the same carefree abandon generally reserved for Bourbon or Scotch.
