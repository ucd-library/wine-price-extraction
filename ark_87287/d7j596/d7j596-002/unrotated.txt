of Shakespeare see

In Shakespeare’s days, nobody drank water.
Water was not safe. There were no newspapers.
night clubs or television; the tavern became the
centre of Elizabethan social life and conversation
thrived.

(MINEO | ING Prior to the accession of James I, and under the
reign of Queen Elizabeth, the taverns did not

sell hard spirits or ‘burning water’ as it was

then called. The best wine lists featured —
iS Malmsey, Madeira, Sherry Sack, Bordeaux,

Rhenish, Malaga and Canary. Shakespeare’s

fondness for wine is best indicated in the song
that he wrote for the banquet scene in the second

act of Antony and Cleopatra.
