B3 SAMUEL JOHNSON “COFFEE HOUSE” COGNAC. .... .. 5.99 68.50

Since Samuel Johnson always considered Brandy the “drink for heroes,” it is quite fitting that a Cognac bear his name in appreciation of his
appreciation. It comes from the best soil of the district—the “Grande Fine Champagne”—and is well worth the $8.50 it should normally oT 7
command.

It is generally acknowledged that the best small distiller in all of Alsace is Alfred Hess. It is his ‘alcools blancs’ that are served in the great
restaurants of France, such as the Restaurant de la Pyramide (Pointe) and Hotel de la Cote d’Or (formerly Dumaine, now the creative 28 year
old Minot). Remarkable for its bouquet, this extraordinary fruit brandy is made from little yellow plums, largely cultivated in his own orchard.

During the slow season in his orchard, Alfred Hess followed the practice of sending his field workers by truck up the Vosges Mountains to an

altitude above 1500 feet to gather wild raspberries for his Framboise. A truck load of men and a day’s picking will yield very few bottles ASA
because it takes 15 quarts of wild raspberries to make one bottle of Framboise. The price is not cheap—a good one costs this much in

France—but it is worth it to those who appreciate the great delicacy and finesse of this remarkable distillate, colorless to the eye, but a

rainbow of flavor to the taste buds.

B15 GASTON BRIAND COGNAC (1906 Vintage). . . ... . . 16.75 185.00

Fernand Pointe, at the Pyramide in Vienne, has often spoken of this Cognac—Gaston Briand’s 1906 vintage—as the best single example of
great Cognac produced in France. We are inclined to agree with him. The bottle and label are unpretentious, but the contents are a revelation
to the brandy fancier.

Since the early 19th Century, it has been the custom of the Hine family to set aside the best Cognac produced during a particularly outstanding

year for their own use, ultimately to be served to honored guests. Only 3 years ago, and for the first time, Francois Hine, the managing L
director of this venerable firm, has consented to part with a few of these treasured bottles—each is numbered and bears a back label relating

the unique history of the contents, hand signed by a director. Normally $24.75. Quantity limited.
