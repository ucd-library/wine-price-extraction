After carefully perusing this wine list, James Beard commented, “I have : be n ; «

spent almost a half-century travelling throughout the world and collect- "4

ing wine lists from everywhere. I know of no other list in existence that

matches this one if judged by width of range, discriminating selection

and realistic prices. Whether the standard be day-in and day-out ee

wine, wines for laying down, rarities from previous decades, the choicest

examples from the leading wine-growing areas. of the world—all are in-

cluded. The wisdom of over three decades of tasting, learning, comparing

is reflected here. I extend my congratulations to Sam and Michael dite

for the creative joy that they have brought to the wine lovers of America.”’
