Discovered in the Hills of Rioja

THE BEST RED WINE OF SPAIN

“Marques de Caceres 1970 is the best Spanish wine | have ever tasted. It is my masterpiece,”
states Emile Peynaud, renowned professor of viniculture at the University of Bordeaux.

We tell a story to gladden the heart of
the wine lover. It is the story of the best
red wine produced in Spain—the tale of
Henri Forner, an important Bordeaux
wine grower, Spanish by birth—and the
wine miracle he performed in Spain.

27A

Because of his uncompromising dedi-
cation to excellence in wine-growing,
Henri Forner is highly regarded in Bor-
deaux. He is the proud proprietor of two
of the noblest vineyards of the Haut-
Médoc—Chateau de Camensac and
Chateau Larose Trintaudon. M. Forner
had long been aware that when Bor-
deaux was devastated in the 1880’s by
Phylloxera, its more foresighted wine
growers crossed the Pyrenées to con-
tinue their beloved craft in the favored
wine soil of the Rioja.

M. Forner had a dream — he was con-
vinced that if he applied the modern
wine-making techniques that he had $
learned in Bordeaux, to the best soil of

the Rioja Alta he would be capable of
Producing wines that would match the
complexity and finesse of those he pro-
duced in the Haut-Médoc. To fulfill his
dream, he decided to take no chances.
Firstly, he employed, as consultant, the
famed Emile Peynaud, the foremost
oenologist of the University of Bor-

deaux. He also obtained the best vine-
yard land in the Rioja Alta region and
built a new bodega, the equal of any
in Bordeaux. He brought in the finest
equipment for cool fermentation. To
assure proper aging, he imported. thirty
million pesetas worth of small oak bar-
rels. The first harvest coincided with a
great vintage year—1970. Every drop is
of this vintage, and unlike most Spanish
wines, there is no blending among vin-
tages. We are dealing with a pure entity.

When our tasting panel first tasted this
wine—a blind tasting—we shouted
“Eureka!” All five experts were aston-
ished by the wealth of fruit, richness,
balance, finesse and fine bouquet..We
followed our customary practice of ask-
ing the panel what they would consider
a fair price for the wine. The responses
ranged between $5.00 and $7.00.

At $2.99 the bottle, $33.50 the case, the
discriminating wine lover is offered one
of the best red wine values currently
available in. the United States. In addi-
tion, the Marques de Caceres 1970
represents an intriguing discovery for
those wine aficionados who want to
wander off the well-trodden paths that
lead to California, Germany and France.
