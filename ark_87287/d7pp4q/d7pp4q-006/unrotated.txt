GLENFIDDICH UNBLENDED SINGLE-MALT 10 YR. WHISKY

What Is Malt Whisky? Sir Robert Bruce Lockhart refers to malt whisky as a
‘liquid gift which exalts the soul” and “goes down singing hymns.” For those

made only of malt, remaining untouched for many long years, has a distinction
and superiority of its own. Some claim it is the local water that makes the
difference. Others the local peat. Whatever it is. a single-malt, like a fine old
cognac, has its own singular character.
