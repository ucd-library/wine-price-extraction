The famous House of Sandeman has engaged in the
Sherry trade since 1790. Over the years it has developed
small private stocks ofits greatest sherries, lovingly aged
in Sandeman’s magnificent bodegas in Jerez. The wines
are superb and rich, from the oldest soleras. Each is the
quintessential sherry of its type.

CASK OF AMONTILLADO

We .are. very. fond of a lovely custom observed in many
private homes in the south of Spain. There, when the host
offers you a glass of Amontillado, he has tapped it directly
from the wooden cask. The ceremony is impressive and
the wine is fresh and delicious.

The Montilla district of Spain now sends us a limited quan-
tity of their ‘home-size’ casks of Amontillado. The wine is
dry with a beautiful, nutty finish. The wooden barrels—con-
taining 8 liters (270.4 oz.) or the equivalent of approximately
41 bottles—are made by hand and are presented ona hand-
some wooden stand. As you drink the wine and the level in
the barrel decreases, you can simply add more Amontillado
from a regular bottle. In that way, the cask will last in-

definitely.
Only $69.50 complete
