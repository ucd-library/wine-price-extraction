Rarely has any spirit cap-
tured the enthusiasm of
the American public as
has BEEFEATER ENG-
LISH GIN. Only two dec
ades ago, the name was
primarily associated with

a beautifully uniformed

guard protecting the
Tower of London and
other nistoric monu-

DY and ask him the
meaning of ‘Beefeater
he will respond with ‘the
best gin in the world’. We
suspect future dictionar
ies will record this fact
If you have a friend who
likes gin, can you think

him than a few bottles of

LES CHARMES 1976

is lower than one would ex-

pect for a wine of this qual-
ity—only $3.29 the bottle,
37.50 the case.

Perrier Jouet. It is a great, great, bone-dry, well- balanced
Champagne that represents the best that France cal
produce. A true classic. Will certainly prove to be a most
exciting Champagne gift.
