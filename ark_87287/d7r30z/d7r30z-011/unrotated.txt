Do you want to add interest and excitement to your drinking and dining
this summer? . . . For a new taste sensation, pour some Creme de Banana over
ice cream .. . Ever try the popular summer drink of the British Empire, Pimm’s
No. 1 cup mixed with lemon soda? ... Or really ice cold Swedish Aquavit as
an accompaniment to hors d’oeuvre? And let us not overlook the delightful
Creme de Cassis; simply mix it in a pitcher with dry vermouth, soda, lemon
peel-and plenty of ice. It looks and tastes good ... Amer Picon and soda, with a
twist of lemon peel, is a continental favorite . . . The Parisian cafes feature
Pernod with water and ice; you may like it... Do not neglect the wonderful

flavor that Swiss Kirsch will add to your summer fruit cups . . . And now let SHERRY WINE & SPIRITS COo.. INC
