03 BEAUJOLAIS 1955, Domaine du Ringuet
The best seller among our red wines and for good reason

last year the New York Times referred to this wine as
“then there is a Beaujolais that is all a Beaujolais should
be, but alas, seldom in this country—purplish-red, with the
fruity aroma and taste of crushed grapes. In our opinion,
v true discovery for those who want true Beaujolais at a
modest price.”’
