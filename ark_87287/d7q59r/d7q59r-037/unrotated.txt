1225 FORTNUM & MASON’S FINE

This interesting example of dry, English Market Cognac is particularly relished by Cognac connoisseurs. Great
Britain is a nation that takes its Brandy very seriously. Aware of this, the 250 Year Old firm of Fortnum & Mason

have acquired some of the best and oldest stocks of Cognac to meet the uncompromising demands of knowing
Londoners.

1213 COGNAC DES CARMES'. . JUST ARRIVED! 7.55 86.07

A rare cognac, distilled and aged under the watchful eye of a charitable order, the Carmelite Fathers. Each bottle
bears the signature, guaranteeing authenticity, of the Father General—The Reverend Father Louis. A fine brandy of
exceptional historic interest for your own holiday pleasure or to send as an unique Christmas Gift.

1297 SINGLE CASK UNBLENDED
COGNAC (1929 Vintage). . . . 9.45 108.00

Here is an Estate-bottled Cognac that was produced during a great vintage year (1929) in the most celebrated
part of the Cognac country, “Grand Fine Champagne”. It has remained in its unblended state in barrels from 1929
until the present date. Cognac of this calibre is difficult to obtain because no more than a few small growers have
the patience and aptitude to put aside, year after year, a distillation of their outstanding vintages.

THE MOST REMARKABLE COGNAC OF FRANCE

Since the early 19th century it has been the custom of the Hine Family to set aside
the best Cognac produced during a particularly outstanding year for their own
future use—ultimately this old precious reserve is served to honored guests on spe-
cial occasions. For the first time, Francois Hine, managing director of this venerable
firm, has consented to part with a few of these treasured bottles—each is numbered
and bears a back label relating the unique history of the contents, hand-signed by a
Hine director—the entire shipment is less than 300 bottles.
