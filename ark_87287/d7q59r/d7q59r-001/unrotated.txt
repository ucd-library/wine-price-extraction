tending into the cold months.

The petit verdot, generally the least
thought of among the four grape varie-
ties, was the first to bud. This is the grape
which yields the highest acidity and the
most alcohol, and it is this acidity which
is predominant in giving the wine the

protection and strength it needs if it is to

the petit verdot, the merlot gives supple-

with the high acidity of

ness and richness to the wine thr ough its
relatively high sugar or glucose content.
The cabernet franc imparts finesse and
the “gout du terroir” — the special char-
acteristics of the soil in which the grapes
are grown. Tannin which is of extreme
importance in the potential for longevity
of a wine and which is perhaps the prin-
cipal element in the structure of a wine—
the backbone, so to speak — is given in
the greatest degree by the cabernet
sauvignon grape, which is always the lat
est to bud in the spring. This year it fol-
lowed the others by about one week.
The tiny quantity of the 1957 vintage
can largely be attributed to weather con-
ditions prevailing throughout the first
weeks of June, during the crucial flower-
ing period of the vine. Overcast and cool
days succeeded one another just at that
time when bright sunshine is more im-
portant. The cabernet sauvignon and
merlot were the first to flower and came
out in reasonable numbers. About one
week later the cabernet franc blossomed
in only medium quantities, to be followed
by the petit verdot in tiny amounts. We
knew then that we were due for heavy

These two afflictions are the result of an

which blow the pollen to such an extent

that part of the flower bunch may be fer-

tilized while another part remains un-

touched. Although the ovary to be fertil-

ized is covered by a gelatinous s ubstance
intended to make the pollen aitak: ad-
verse weather conditions such as these
may frustrate nature’s intentions.

Therein lies the principal cause for the
