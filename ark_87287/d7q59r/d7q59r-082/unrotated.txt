The name of Wisdom & Warter, now a century old, has been a familiar part of
my upbringing for more years than | care to remember. It was my grandfather's
custom to serve Wisdom’s Fino or Amontillado each evening. | have recently
retasted each of these Sherries. | can only report that the high opinion held in
my youth was entirely confirmed.

Candidly, | am quite convinced that this is one of the most unique opportunities
since repeal to acquire Spain’s very finest (not their ordinary) wines... these
prices have been made possible only by a gigantic acquisition and the entire
savings are being passed on to you. There is not a Sherry in the entire lot which
would not be good value even if it sold for $3.00 the bottle, the average price
that has prevailed for the wines of Wisdom & Warter during recent years.

A magnificent example of bone dry, pale, straw colored Sherry. This classic “Fino Palma” has helped Wisdom &
Warter achieve its great international reputation, now a century old. An ideal aperitif when served slightly chilled.
The equal of many Finos that command $3.00 or more the bottle.

S2_ WISDOM’S ROYAL BROWN OLOROSO . . . .

There are few wines produced in the world that quite achieve the rich, deep flavor, or dark color depth of a fine
s3rown Sherry. Here is a typical, fully aged example. Highly recommended between meals with fruit, nuts or
cake, or as an after-dinner dessert wine.
