One of the noblest of the worlds great wines is un-
doubtedly an authentic vintage port that has achieved
its maturation, like fine still wine, in bottle rather than
cask. Here is the greatest collection in the world —
moved to our cellars in New York, bottle by bottle,
from the private port museum that Richard Hooper &
Sons have maintained in their country house for almost
a century. Honored guests at their home were asked the
date of their birth or anniversary and a vintage port of
that year was served.

 

In a small personal way, you can follow the same
LOQPERS thoughtful practice. We suggest sending, as an imagina-
tn dont) tive birthday or anniversary gift, authentic vintage port

| Seeman d proudly bearing on its label ‘THE YEAR,’ And do not
ae overlook the possibilities of sending as the most indi-
vidual of Chrismas gifts, a bottle of port that bears the
year of his birth, anniversary, or any other special event.
If you have not yet experienced the vinous joy of
bottle-aged authentic vintage port, we strongly advise

 

 

 

that you acquire some for your own pleasure.

AS A THOUGHTFUL CHRISTMAS GIFT.
