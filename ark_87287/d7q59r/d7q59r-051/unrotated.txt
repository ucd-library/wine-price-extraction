The Greatest White Wines of Fran co

FROM THE ESTATE OF J. MONNOT

M. MONNOT, in an extremely small way, is un-
surpassed and possibly unequalled among the
white wine producers of France. His total pro-
duction of white Burgundy rarely exceeds ten
small barrels, or 250 cases in all. The wines that VINEY ARD
extraordinary wealth of bouquet and flavor,
powerful and entirely remarkable.

We were astonished by what we tasted at his MEURSAULT CHARMES
vineyard—his 1954s were superb, much beyond
the class of anything else we found among the
white Burgundies—his 1955¢ can only be de-
scribed as fantastically great—and his 1956s are
incredulously outstanding, and in their own
way, quite in the league with the 1955s. If you
are interested in the best dry white wine of all
France, we urge that you try any of these. There
is not a single wine in this entire group that
