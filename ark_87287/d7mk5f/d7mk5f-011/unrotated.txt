AN IMPORTANT MESSAGE ABOUT SPIRITS
SCOTCH, BOURBON, GIN AND COGNAC

For over three decades, Sherry’s has consistently sold wines and spirits to its ever-growing
clientele at the lowest possible prices. 1965 brings a new, strange challenge to us, because
we are not permitted by law to advertise our liquor prices — a problem that has made it dif-
ficult for us to keep you fully informed of the wonderful, wonderful values available at our

shop.

We list below a vast array of truly superb spirits that are NOW ON SALE. You need simply
tear this page out — check any or all of the items in which you are interested. We will
send by return mail our low current sale prices. If you want to know immediately, simply
phone.

All are available at substantial savings — and they will be delivered free to your home or any
summer address in New York throughout the vast United Parcel Delivery Zone.

_] I am interested in these 26 spirits on sale—
please rush prices to me by return mail.
If interested only in individual items, please check those

items specifically, and we will send you prices on those items.
