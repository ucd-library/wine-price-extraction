DOMAINE DE LA ROMANEE CONTI

The 1962s will be here in June.

Perhaps the rarest and most sought after red wines in the world are those produced by the
Domaine de la Romanee Conti. The production is small, they are carefully rationed, but
we happily report that we will be the lucky recipients of 50 cases this June. They are
expensive, but worth the price. The time to acquire them is now while still available rather

than wait until the excellent ’62s are gone.

A word about their 62s — two months of perfect weather, lasting through the vintage, gave
the Domaine one of the best wines they have produced in a decade and deserves the appella-
tion ‘great.’ They are not inferior to the classic ’61s; will mature more quickly; and thus
can be enjoyed sooner. All of us who have visited the Domaine de la Romanee Conti and
have tasted the wines, have been truly impressed by the beautiful harmony of the ’62s.

“Grands Echezeaux” proved the equal and quite similar to the ‘“Riche-
bourg” and “La Tache” at a recent tasting. We therefore recommend this
great wine as the best value from the Domaine de la Romanee Conti.

THE BEST 1964 DRY WHITE WINE OF SWITZERLAND

All Europe is aglow with enthusiastic reports on the excellence of the dry, crisp, refreshing
white wines of Switzerland produced during the 1964 vintage. We were lucky — we got two
of the best — a superb Neuchatel produced by the town of Neuchatel itself under the
guidance of the Mayor — and a Fendant Spatlese that comes from the classic, many-centuries-

old Domaine of the Bishops of Sion. We are offering both of them at bargain prices — both
will command much more next year — both available in half bottles.

is bone dry, thirst quenching, refreshing and with a subtle, haunting bouquet. Available in half bottles at
