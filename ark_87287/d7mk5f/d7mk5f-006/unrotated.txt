THE 1964 VINTAGE—THE MOST CAREFULLY SELECTED REGIONAL

RHINE & MOSELLES WE HAVE OFFERED IN OUR HISTORY!

Don’t let the low prices dissuade you. These are delightful, fresh, beautiful examples of
regional Rhines and Moselles. Each of these were selected after months of comparative tast-
ing by Fritz Hallgarten, author of the book, “The Wines Of Germany.” Many wine lovers
consider the Rhines and Moselles, endowed with elegance, haunting flower-like bouquet, and
low alcoholic content, the best of the white wines produced anywhere on the globe — white
wines that had to survive the cold climate and constant threat of frost.

It is this struggle to survive that gives the German wines their classic breed. We do not pre-
tend these are the best of the wines of Germany — you will have to look elsewhere on these
pages for the giants — but we do know that day-in and day-out, and for the money, and
especially for the summer, here are wines that will delight you.
