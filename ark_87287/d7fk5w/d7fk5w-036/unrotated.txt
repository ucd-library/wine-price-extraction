 

GIN

Gin is a distilled product of neutral grain spirits and produced,
according to many varying ‘private formulas’, after an infusion of
several botanicals among which are juniper, angelica root, coriander,
cardamon and cassia. The vapors of the heated grain spirit pass
through the berry-head and retain the flavor of its contents when
they are condensed. The type and proportion of these determine
the flavor. “London” or “dry’’ gins are the kind most generally
made and sold in America and are used in innumerable drinks
where a gin base is essential.

A few “sweetened” or “Old Tom” gins are available and these
are made after the English fashion by the addition of a small
amount of simple syrup.

“Holland Gin” or “Geneva Gin’’, as it is very often called, is a
Dutch product distilled at a relatively low proof and most always
taken “neat” or with a dash of bitters added. Geneva gin should
never be used in mixed drinks.

AMERICAN WHISKEY

Much has been written about whiskey but it is always interesting
to know that this popular distillation was unknown in America
during early Colonial days. Mention of the word “whiskey” was
not recorded until the Revolution and prior to that our ancestors
drank rum which was made in New England. It is controversial
whether the whiskey referred to had been brought from England
by traders or distilled here with the “know how” of Scotch and
Irish settlers.

BONDED—a guarantee that the whiskey is straight, is aged for a
minimum of four years, bottled at 100 proof and has been aged,
stored and bottled under Government Supervision and in strict
conformance with Government regulations. Pure alcohol is 200
proof, therefore, bonded whiskies are half alcohol by volume.
(Based on a temperature of 60 degrees Fahrenheit. )

STRAIGHT—any type whiskey made from a fermented mash of
gtain containing not less than 51% of rye, corn, etc., and which
has been distilled at not more than 160 proof. It must be aged for
at least two years in new charred oak casks and cannot contain or
be blended with neutral spirits.

BLEND OF STRAIGHTS—these are merely what the term implies
—two or more straight whiskies, of either the same or various
ages, blended together according to various formulas.

SPIRIT BLEND—a minimum of 20% straight whiskey by volume
blended with neutral spirits, preferably grain, that have been

distilled to 190 proof making them almost tasteless, colorless or
“neutral’’ in character,
