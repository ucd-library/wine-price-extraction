     

ROMANCE IN COGNAC

If you are interested in the fine old Cognacs of the best
growths or districts, the story that follows should be of
interest to you.

   

It concerns a remarkable, albeit, small collection of
Cognacs dating back to the middle of the 19th Century.

This collection was part of a “family reserve” in the
estates of distinguished distillers and vineyard proprietors
in the best of the Cognac districts. These authentic Cognacs
of the last century have been lying quietly in a deep cache
on the estate. Fortunately, they were so well secreted
throughout World War II that they were not discovered
or disturbed and were known only to the owners.

The casks, which were made of the finest Limousin oak,
were in excellent condition. Because of the extremely fine
quality of the casks there was very little evaporation and
little refill was necessary from other casks to keep the liquid
level at a ‘‘High” as is the customary practice. The Cognac
has not been subjected to the addition of any sweetening,
or coloring nor any extraneous matter of any kind. The
casks contained only the finest Cognacs in their original
state refined and mellowed only by the hand of Time; and
Time has dealt most magnificently and delicately with each
of them. Each Cognac is in every sense of the word an
original ‘“Cognac Nature’.

After many discussions and much arduous persuasion, we
finally prevailed upon the owners to part with a portion of
the collection and we are now the proud possessors of these
four beautiful Cognacs, each distinct in flavor and bouquet
and each with its own character.

Because of the fact that under the latest United States
Treasury regulations, the vintage or age of these Cognacs 1s
not permitted to be placed on the labels of bottles entering
the United States, it was decided to have the Cognacs
imported in ‘'Categories”’ and they will be known as:

ARMAGNAC

From another district, a little to the south of the Gers Départe-
ment of Cognac, comes a very palatable and little known brandy
esteemed by the French as a great delicacy. It is second only to
the brandy of Cognac and highly prized by the true connoisseur.
The best Armagnac brandies are distilled from Bas-Armagnac wines
and are divided into three classes, known as Grands, Fins, and
Petits.

Ancient Normandy is the home of an exquisite apple brandy,
the like of which few American applejack drinkers ever encounter.
Really fine Calvados is indeed scarce. It is magnificent when taken
as a liqueur with after-dinner coffee.
