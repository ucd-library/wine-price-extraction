COGNAC

Cognac is the name of the finest of all brandy, and it is distilled
from a wine which is made of grapes grown within the legally
defined district of France from whence it derives its name. No
other brandy can authentically be called Cognac. It is from the
Charente or “inner circle’’ of Cognac, which is again divided into
districts, that the choicest brandics are produced. Named in their
order of quality, they are Grande Champagne, Petite Champagne,
Borderies and Fins Bois. Should the name “‘Champagne’’, as used
in connection with brandy be confusing, Cognac historians point
out that this term is merely obtained from the ancient name of the
district, which was once called La Champagne.

The brandies listed in this catalogue were selected from among
the acknowledged leaders.
