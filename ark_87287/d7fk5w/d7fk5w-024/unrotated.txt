For the real connoisseur, however, there is
just one Scotch Whiskey — THE GLEN-
LIVET ($10.59). This finest Highland malt
whiskey is in great demand for blending by
other distillers and only a small quantity
finds its way into bottles.

This year, a special treat is in store for Glenlivet lovers.
Captain Smith Grant, the proprietor, bottled a few cases of
15 year old in honor of the Coronation. There is still a small
quantity of this “King of Kings” on our shelves ($21.50).

Have you considered an unusual Brandy? We still have a
small quantity of JUSTERINI AND BROOKS 1875 vintage
brandy, handsomely boxed for $26. ap

There are also a large number of fine bran-
dies available in beautiful Baccarat Crystal
decanters. These favorites are REMY MAR-
TIN LOUIS XIII ($37.60) COUVOISIER
($24.38) and MONNET ($36.99).

And before we get away from brandies—our HAUT-BARON
ARMAGNAC ($19.45) in a striking gold box is certified
over 80 years old and a welcome gift in any household.

CorprALs find many uses and are prized
by the ladies as well as the men. This year there are many
varieties available in charming china figurines, delftware, and
beautiful Venitian glass. The pictures on page 13 tell the story
better than words. From “gay Paree’’ comes our EADY
MAXIM cordial in pure white delft. One of our friends has
made two beautiful lamps from the statues after finishing the
cordials.
