“SEASON 8 Of Goud Living

Summer, more than any season of the year, represents in-
creased leisure, greater relaxation, and additional opportunity
for enjoyment. A little planning in the selection of wines and
spirits can bring added pleasure to this joyous season. This
booklet was created in the hope that it would help you plan
(particularly is this the purpose of the chapter by James
Beard, who, in addition to being a member of our staff, is
also associate editor of Gourmet Magazine).

We are eager to continue to supply your needs even though
you may leave town for all or part of the summer. Just as
you can count on us for prompt delivery service in the city,
so you can rely on us for fast delivery to your summer
address. (We do not charge for delivery to any point in

New York State. )
