magnificent 1955 Clarets and
two exceptionally fine white
wines.

We have searched long and

hard for pleasing examples of

sell for about $1 the bottle. We
have found them in Bordeaux
and we unreservedly recom-
be Pit mend these 1959s as one of

Chateau bottled and of the great 1955 vintage. Outstanding
Claret value.

189 BORDEAUX ROUGE 1959, Boyer Freres
We tasted competitively 18 different examples of Bordeaux
Rouge before we finally decided on this one. In our opinion, it
is superior in fruit, bouquet and breed to most of the Bordeaux
regional red wines that sell in New York for $1.50 or more the
bottle.

267 BORDEAUX BLANC 1959, Boyer Freres

This regional wine of Bordeaux is a happy harmony of adequate
body, sufficient fruit, and dryness to make it a pleasing and satis-
fying everyday white table wine.

409 ALSATIAN RIESLING 1959, Hanhart

The best Reisling Hanhart has shipped us from Alsace in many
years. Rich in fruit and vigor. ‘

003 FENDANT SPATLESE 1959
3 One of the most highly regarded dry white wines of Switzer-
396 VIN ROSE 1959. Bovyer-Bordeaux ate From a vineyard owned for centuries by the Bishops

A charming pink wine grown not far from Bordeaux.
