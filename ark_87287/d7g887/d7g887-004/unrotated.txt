530 — LIEBFRAUMILCH 1955

Almost any wine produced in Rheinhesse
can legally be called ‘Liebfraumilch’ with
the consequence that much dubious wine
bears this exceedingly popular name. Don t
let the low cost of this wine dishearten you.
It’s excellent. Half bottles at 75¢

A clean, delicate little Moselle from one of
the most famous wine growing towns of
the valley. Piesport faired well in 1955, but
was a failure in 1956. Hence, a unique

opportunity.

606 — GERMAN MAY WINE

One of the most provocative aromas that
delights us in the Spring is that of the
fresh, tingling woodrulf plant — the de-
liohtful ingredient of “May Wine.’ Here
is a magnilicent example, just arrived from
the Rhine, that will add timely pleasure to

your entertaining.
