stantial savings. However, we do not recommend that you purchase 1969, unless you already have a goodly :
supply of '66s and '67s in your cellar, and you are stocking the '69s as a gap-filling successor. aa
For those of you whose inventory of wines is only on a current basis, and you are not involved in get
laying down cases for later in the decade, we strongly urge that you acquire 1966 and 1967, rather
than take on the '69s at this point in your wine life. WHY? You need merely read the vintage report - .
that appears in the recent TIME-LIFE book "Wines & Spirits." We quote verbatim:— sc
1966—The Chateau owners were happy as they gathered this great vintage ; they were able to obtain gon ™
the highest prices for claret in Bordeaux wine history. A bit less body than the '64s, but com-
pensated for by unusual bouquet, better balance, and a remarkable similarity to the extraordinary
'53s, as well as sufficient tannin to provide the backbone for exceptional longevity. itil
1967—The crop was most beneficial to the wine drinker because it was exceptionally large, above ogg ©
average in quality, and produced a soft, quick-maturing, fruity wine with a fine bouquet. This a
most useful, satisfying vintage can be consumed joyously while we wait for the slower maturing
'6ls and '66s to come to their full fruition.
