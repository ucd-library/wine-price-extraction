The prices for the famed red Bordeaux are reaching astronomical
heights. Wines like Lafite and Mouton ’64 and ’66 are commanding
over $160 the case in Bordeaux today. This does not remove the
possibility of drinking truly fine clarets if you have the ego
strength to move away from “great labels and great years.”

No. Bottle Case
101 BORDEAUX ROUGE 1966.......... 1.39 15.00
Honest, well made wine from a specific vineyard—Clos St. Germain.
838 CHATEAU BELLEVUE 1964........ 1.69 18.25
Only a few cases remain—a delight in red wine.

223 SIMPLET, Guy Schyler............. 1.79 19.35

This non-vintage blend of several years is a beautifully balanced
delight which has become a favorite of knowledgeable wine
drinkers in Bordeaux and Paris.

194 CHATEAU LOISEAU 1966......... 1.79 19.35

We first tasted this wine at Chateau Haut Brion and were delighted
with it. Surprising amount of finesse for a wine priced so low.

263 DOMAINE DE L’ILE 1967.......... 1.99 21.50
An intriguing wine grown on an island in the Gironde River, di-
rectly adjacent to the town of Margaux. It is owned by the same
man who is the proprietor of Chateau Pichon Longueville Lalande.
Excellent—ready now.

170 CHATEAU LAVALLADE 1966...... 1.99 21.50

An excellent St. Emilion bought in its entirety by Nicolas and
proudly bottled by them.

842 CHATEAU HANTEILLAN 1964..... 1.99 21.50

This very wine was selected at a blind tasting held in the offices
of Air France and is served on their European flights. From the
Medoc.

311 CHATEAU PONTESAC 1964....... 1.99 21.50
Pleasant, light, good character. Medoc.
154 MARGAUX 1966............-.---:: 2.29 24.75

From a specific vineyard, Chateau Mourrison. Typical of Margaux
with fine bouquet, silky texture and good breed.

267 ST. JULIEN 1966...........--.---: 2.29 24.75
From a specific St. Julien vineyard, Chateau du Credo. This is in-
evitably the most expensive of the Bordeaux regionals —a little
fuller than Margaux, and maturing more quickly than Pauillac or
St. Estephe.

848 CHATEAU COUTELIN MERVILLE
a ee 2.29. 24.75

A discovery — not far from Calon Segur in St. Estephe and similar
in its characteristics.

629 CHATEAU PICHON LALANDE 1965 2.59 = 27.95

A light, pleasant red wine, Chateau bottled at a noble Pauillac
vineyard — designed for present drinking.

359 CHATEAU PICQUE CAILLOU 1964. 2.79 30.15

Entirely remarkable. Extraordinary example of delicate, well bal-
anced red Graves.

846 CHATEAU ROC ST. MICHEL 1964.. 2.79 30.15
A big, lusty St. Emilion that has many more good years ahead of it.

334 CHATEAU DASSAULT 1964....... 2.99 32.30

The proprietor of this St. Emilion vineyard, which has just been
classified “Grand Cru,” is Mr. Dassault, the world famous plane
builder who has created the Mirage and the Mystere (known in the
United States as the Falcon Jet). He takes pride in his vineyard
which is reflected by its round, full, fruity thoroughbred qualities.
Will sell for considerably more than $2.99 in the Fall.

268 CHATEAU GREYSAC 1966........ 3.33 35.96

From a vineyard owned by Georges Hereil, President of Simca.
Unusual class and distinction. An excellent Medoc.

122 CHATEAU GLORIA 1964.......... 3.49 37.70

Amazing! The vineyard is owned by Henri Martin, the President of
the Bordeaux Growers and Managing Director of Chateau Latour.
Will compete with its neighbor in St. Julien, Chateau Leoville
Lascases, in distinction.

191 CHATEAU FERRIERE 1964........ 3.49 37.70
A classified “2nd Growth” of Margaux, which puts it on the same
classification level as Mouton Rothschild, Palmer, Lascombes and
Calon Segur. Here is a wine that should command $5.00 the bottle
that can be acquired for $3.49.

712 CHATEAU ROUGET 1964......... 3.79 40.95
An outstanding Pomerol that is similar to Chateau Petrus in its
characteristics. Well balanced, fruity, deep in flavor, a big wine.

5086 CHATEAU HAUT BRION 1963.... 3.99 46.75
The notes of our tasting panel read “typical for Chateau Haut
Brion; power is coupled with finesse; truly in the ‘big leagues’; the
best of the ’63s with only Chateau Latour even competing; worth
$6.00 if pedigree, fame and excellence are to be considered the
criteria in ‘appraisal’.” By Fall, the price should be dramatically
higher, so we certainly suggest you buy now and serve great wine
in your home at relatively modest cost.

381 CHATEAU BOUSCAUT 1964....... 4.29 46.34
Bouscaut is a classic “Grand Cru” Graves vineyard exhibiting
roundness and breed. Delightful for present drinking and with
many good years ahead.

826 CHATEAU DUHART MILON 1952. . 4.99 53.90
Here we are dealing with a classified Medoc vineyard directly ad-
jacent to Chateau Lafite Rothschild, and of the great, slow-matur-
ing 1952 vintage. Were this wine priced at $8.00 the bottle, it would
not be astonishing—at $4.99 it is not far short of being sensational.
Good for at least another ten years.

818 CARRUADES DE CHATEAU

LAFITE ROTHSCHILD 1964....... 6.99 75.50
From the soil of Chateau Lafite itself. At this vineyard, they follow
the practice of labeling the wines Chateau Lafite when the vines
are over 12 years old and adding the expression ‘Carruades’ when
the vines are younger. Often, Carruades tastes better than Lafite
itself because the younger vines mean quicker maturation and
they therefore are ready to be enjoyed that much sooner. Here, you
can drink truly great wine at a price that is not frighteningly high.
Quantity limited.
