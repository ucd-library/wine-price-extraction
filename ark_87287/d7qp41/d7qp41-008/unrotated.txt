and

S Of 1969 RED BORDEAUX—Early in summer it became clear that the crop could

vero not be a big one because of cold, wet and late Spring. The flowering of

n of the vines were four weeks late. Not much more than half the average crop

ring was produced, forcing up prices dramatically. A good middle summer
brightened the outlook. Fine conditions persisted prior to and through-
out the crucial harvest period. There was elation after this cliff-
hanger finish because quality proved so much better than earlier
predictions.

In general, the 1969s have good color and are already showing soft and
pleasing, with plenty of fruit. A general improvement was shown when
the same wines were retasted in January. The best have depth and char-
acter and will surely make great bottles. They can be found in the
Medoc and Graves, with St. Emilion and Pomerol being less good because
they were picked a week earlier and thus were denied some of the sun-
shine benefit. Not all '69s were good, and they must be chosen with
care. The worst aspect is that the growers have a small crop to sell
following the poor 1968 vintage. They are determined to extract the
highest possible price for their excellent, but not great, red wines
to compensate. Early evidence indicates that they are succeeding be-
cause every case offered to the merchants have been snapped up at high
95 prices. Our advise is to move in quickly on 1966, which is a better
scent year than '69—and also to favorably consider 1967.
cs 1969 RED BURGUNDY——The London Financial Times reports "No one doubts
the quality of this year's Burgundy vintage; but everyone is concerned
50 about the exceptionally steep rise of growers' prices...there has not
- the been anormal vintage here since 1966, and even that was not very large.
it in The '67s were uneven and the whites in short supply. The '68s were very
poor...the '69 vintage in October took place in splendid weather. The
95 most optimistic state that the red wine was as fine as 1925—others com=
pared it to the great 1961, the best year of the decade. The combination
eS of vintage optimism and shortage of stocks led to runaway prices at the
Hospices de Beaune auction—some wine was bid in at over $90 the case!

75 The growers were not eager to sell——the prices will reach us in the

Spring—and they will be offered to you on the most favorable basis pos-
re Sible. The older great vintages such as ‘66, '64, *62, “Sr ant’ ts are
54.85 now either unavailable or have gone up over 50% in France. OUR ADVICE—

acquire your 1966 and older years of red Burgundy now—do not wait until

the Fall when they surely will be higher.
01 1969 BEAUJOLAIS & POUILLY-FUISSE——An outstanding wine authority has
emely just returned from his 15th annual visit to the vineyards and states,
"Far and away the best quality I have ever tasted in Beaujolais and
Pouilly-Fuissé in almost two decades—even better than the fabulously

10 good, long-lived '6ls. But alas !—The good estate-bottlings are hard

to come by——it is questionable that 60% of a normal crop was brought in

—and the growers are not eager to part with their treasures unless =r
49 fetcharansomprice. Pouilly-Fuissé cost almost double the price of '66
jished and the good, authentic Beaujolais are up 40%.
