The Great RED BURGUNDIES

No. Bottle Case

387 BEAUJOLAIS BROUILLY 1967

fen Carnie) 2... ee 1.99 22.50
This delightful, fruity, and top flight Beaujolais, from outstanding
soil, does not come in a bottle—but in a handsome pitcher or
carafe, a thing of beauty in its own right. Only 60 cases — and then
no more!

789 BEAUJOLAIS CHENAS 1966 ....... 1.99 22.50

The commune of Chenas is bounded on the north by Julienas and
on the south by Fleurie. It comes from the cellars of the Rt. Hon.
Ernest Marples, M.P., and British Cabinet Minister for 11 years.
Worth considerably more.

211 CHASSAGNE-MONTRACHET
ROUGE 1966 «2c; «os ee eee 2.99 32.30

Chassagne-Montrachet produces what many consider the greatest
white wines of the world. It also produces, in small quantity, some
of the most charming red wine of all Burgundy. Light, but excel-
lent. Here is a beauty. Estate bottled by Ramonet.

628 AUXEY-DURESSES, LE VAL, 1962.. 3.49 37.70

A sleeper — because the wines of this town are not as well known
as their more famous neighbors, the result is truly outstanding
wine at relatively low cost. Estate bottled by R. Roy.

248 CHASSAGNE-MONTRACHET,
BOURDRIOTTES, 1966 ............ 3.89 42.00

Like the Chassagne-Montrachet listed above, we are dealing with
outstanding red wine. However, this one comes from the best
single red wine vineyard of the town. Unusual finesse,- beautiful
bouquet, ready now. Estate bottled by Ramonet.

135 FIXIN, CLOS NAPOLEON, 1966.... 3.99 43.10

Just north of the great Chambertin vineyard, and similar in depth
and character, except at about half the price. If you are not looking
for a big name, but a big wine, here it is. Estate bottled by Pierre
Gelin.

278 VOLNAY CHAMPANS 1962........ 4.49 48.50

We were served this wine at the friendly home of Marquis
d’Angerville and were impressed by its velvety qualities, out-
standing bouquet and individual taste. Estate bottled by Marquis
d’Angerville.

1011 MAZOYERES CHAMBERTIN 1966. 4.99 53.90

The finest wines of this exceptional wine commune do not carry
the prefix ‘‘Gevrey,” but only the vineyard name. Here is a great,
great “Grand Cru” wine, produced during an outstanding vintage
by Camus, a man who is considered a Dean among the Chambertin
growers. It deserves to sell for over $7.00 the bottle, and the kind

of red Burgundy that will continue to flourish for another decade. 6

A crisis has been reached in Burgundy. There was joy after the
fruity, well-balanced and long-lived 1966 vintage was gathered.
But there followed, in rapid succession (except for Beaujolais), two
disastrous years for the Cote d’Or red wines—1967 and 1968. The
recent 1969 vintage brought cheers for ‘greatness’—it was com-
pared to the legendary ’49s and ’23s. But joy was not unrestrained
because, as in 1961, when the growers finally counted the barrels
in their cellars they found, alas!—they had gathered but half a
normal crop.

WHAT HAS BEEN THE RESULT? The 1969 vintage is being quoted
at opening prices that are 50% higher than the opening quotations
of 1966. (You need merely look at the bids fetched for the ’69s at
the November Hospices de Beaune auction for dramatic evidence
— Corton went for over $100 the case without bottling — the highest
in history!) The previous outstanding years such as ’59, ’61, ’62, 64
and ’66 are either unobtainable, or 40% higher than they were a
year ago.

What should you, a cost conscious wine lover do? Our advice is
simple — buy all that you can of the great years before higher
replacement cost will inevitably be reflected in our quotations
next Fall.

403 CHAPELLE CHAMBERTIN 1964.... 5.99 64.70

Here is another “Grand Cru” vineyard of the town of Gevrey-
Chambertin, estate bottled by Damoy. Our associate, Joseph
Stricks, considers it the best single red Burgundy he has tasted
during the last few months.

187 CORTON BRESSANDES 1962 ...... 6.49 70.10

The best single red wine vineyard of the Cote de Beaune. If you
are looking for great red Burgundy to serve at dinner during the
months of entertaining ahead, here it is. Estate bottled by Prince
de Merode, a cousin of the King of Belgium. : ase '

1001 CHARMES CHAMBERTIN 1962.... 6.79 73.35
Only 31 acres in size, separated from Chambertin itself only by a
narrow dirt road. Great depth, long life ahead. Estate bottled by
Camus.

740 VOSNE-ROMANEE 1959 6.99 75.50
This wine was-stored, for the last decade, in the historic cellars
that were once the residence of the Dukes of Burgundy. It is now
the property of Joseph Drouhin, and the label proudly bears his
name. An authentic Burgundy of a great year that will make a
serious bid to be considered one of the best red Burgundies you
have ever tasted.

668 BEAUNE GREVES 1959 6.99 75.50

The better vineyards of Beaune are characterized by softness and
lightness, noted for finesse and aroma, and are relatively quick to
mature. Here is perhaps the best single vineyard of this famed
wine-producing town and is a true glory in 1959. From the cellars
of Joseph Drouhin.

1002 LATRICIERES CHAMBERTIN 1962. 6.99 75.50
This wine was a bargain last month when it sold for $8.49, for it is
estate bottled by a remarkable grower, M. Camus. One of the great
vineyards of the Chambertin area that has now acquired sufficient
bottle age to be served now.

1003 CHAMBERTIN 1964 ......-----+": 7.95 85.85

Chambertin is always extremely expensive and when good, de-
serves the price. Extreme power, great longevity, extraordinary
class. It was the favorite of Napoleon and Alexandre Dumas who
liked contemplating life through a ‘glass of Chambertin.’ Should
sell for over $10 the bottle. Estate bottled by Camus.

798 VOSNE-ROMANEE,
LA GRANDE RUE, 1964......--::-: 9.95 107.45

I have known Burgundians who have stated, ‘‘La Grand Rue” is the
best vineyard soil of the entire Cote d’Or. This may be open to
question, but the least that can be said of this wine is that it is a4
giant, entirely remarkable, and deserves to be in the company 0
the GREAT. Only 140 cases were produced in 1964. Sold for $12.50
last month. Estate bottled by Henri Lamarche.
