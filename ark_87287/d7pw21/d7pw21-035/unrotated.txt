These gay, lighthearted wines, make no more
pretentions to greatness than the cheerful
little country wines of France. Like these,
they are fresh, clean and satisfying wines
such as can be found in many of France’s
country inn cellars; they are without a
label or date, but nonetheless, good. Our
ST. MICHEL wines—and there is a red
one, a white one and Vin Rose—come from
the Sonoma hillsides which provide some
of the finest vineyard land in California.
They are available in the economic gallon
size; the more modest half gallon quantity:
and the familiar bottle size.

Choose among them—they are all proud
wines, bottled at the vineyard in northern
California—and all are offered at astonish-
ingly low prices which will permit you to
serve California’s better table wine, every-
day with every meal, with little concern
about the cost—just as the Frenchman might
do in his Parisien apartment or village home.
