Bottle Case
MANZANILLA (La Gitana) 2.44 26.32

The salty tang of the ocean breeze that hovers over the little seaport town
of Sanlucar de Barremeda is dramatically evident in this bone, bone dry
wine.

MONTILLA (Solera Fina) 2.49 27.95

Fuller than a Fino, less-astringent than a Manzanilla, but dry. Serve chilled.

MANZANILLA (La Guita) 2.65 29.00

One of the driest wines on earth—a favorite of bullfighters and their de-
votees.

LA INA (Pedro Domecq) 3.09 20.61

In Spain, when served chilled, this is the equivalent of our “Dry Martini”.

TIO PEPE (Gonzalez & Byass) 3.88 42.29

The beloved “Uncle Joe’—the most famous Fino of all Spain.

SAN PATRICIO (Garvey) 4.18 45.14

Stop a sophisticated Spaniard and he will tell you “This is the One’:

BONE DRY (Williams & Humbert) 4.95 53.46
The cultural intermarriage of Britain and Spain combine here to give us
the austerity of one and the earthiness of the other.

BRISTOL FINO (Harvey’s) 6.14 66.31

Historically, the sea route from Bristol, England to Jerez has been busy
for centuries. Out of this traffic was born “Bristol Fino”, perhaps the
noblest dry Sherry of them all.

Spain has produced great artists, musi-
cians, poets, philosophers .and heroic
figures. It is a country of taste, develop-
ing out of a great tradition, and when
Spaniards drink their own wines, they
do not do it simply because the vine-
yards are nearby, but because they gen-
uinely like them and their sophistication
teaches them which are the good ones.
We have spent many months, here at
Sherry’s, finding out what Spaniards
consider the best wines of their country.

We genuinely believe that the noblest
vineyards and the most intriguing wines
of Spain are listed below—wines that,
dollar for dollar, and in terms of intrinsic
merit, certainly deserve a more favor-
able reception than they are presently
receiving from the wine drinkers of the
United States.

 

 

  
   

RED WINES
RIOJA CLARETE 1959 (C.V.N.E.) 1.19 13.50

Fine-textured, rather light, like a sound Bordeaux, but considerably less

expensive.

RIOJA IMPERIAL GRAN RESERVA
1949 (C.V.N.E.) 2.19 23.50

Frank Schoonmaker tells us “remarkable finesse, fine bouquet and flavor—
best red wine of Spain that could take on many of the famed red wines of
Bordeaux”.

RIOJA 1955 (Marques de Murrieta) 2.25 24.00
It is a short haul over the Pyrenees from Bordeaux to Rioja. This explains
the similarity between these wines and those of the Medoc.

RIOJA (Marques des Riscal) 2.25 24.00

Riscal is a synonym for the “best” in Madrid.

RIOJA BLANCA 1957 (C.V.N.E.) 1.19 13.50
We gulp as we state that this inexpensive dry white wine is probably one of
the most satisfying dry white wines of all Spain.

RIOJA MONOPOLE 1957 (C.V.N.E.) 1.69 18.50

From the same source as the one listed above, but from the best soil—the

cream of the crop.

THE “SPANISH” SAMPLER—Embark on an heroic adventure in
the land of olives, gazpacho, tapas and paella—acquire these 14 wines
listed above y would cost 40.88 if purchased individually—the
total cost for all 14 bottles—only $38.50 Complete.
