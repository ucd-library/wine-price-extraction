Talleyrand’s home
and vineyard...during
the Congress of Vienna.

In our most recent publication, Dr. Alfred Frankfurter, eminent authority
on the art, pointed out that there is a relationship between history and wine.
Nowhere is it more evident than at Chateau Haut Brion, the home of
Talleyrand, the distinguished diplomat who represented France during
the Congress of Vienna. Today it is the proud property of the family of
Clarence Dillon, and is often visited by his son, Hon. Douglas Dillon, the
former Ambassador to France who is now the Secretary of the Treasury.
The property is managed by a cousin, the genial Seymour Weller.

Chateau Haut Brion was producing Bordeaux’ greatest red wine back in
the middle ages and the reputation of its clarets has remained undimin-
ished to this day. Here is the “uncontested King of Graves,” the lifetime
favorite of his Majesty, King Edward VII, and a vineyard that never fails

to produce a great wine. It is the gravelly soil of Chateau Haut Brion that
gives the wine its unique combination of pow

er, beautifully coupled with
great finesse.

limited number of bottles from so
