VERY BEST OF SWITZERLAND

Thousands of Americans visit Switzerland each year. They develop an affection for the wonderful
white wines of this country, but are disappointed when they come back to America because either
the wines are completely unavailable, or are hopelessly expensive. We have gone to great efforts to
seek out the best that Switzerland has to offer, have achieved the trust and cooperation of the Swiss
growers, and proudly offer their wines, for the first time in America, in their full range and at prices
that are in many instances almost 50% less than what you have been accustomed to paying.

which includes the jewel-like town of St. Saphorin, produces some of the finest white wines of Switzer-
land. This one is extraordinary.

character.
