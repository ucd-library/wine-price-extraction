Our literary section, which you will find elsewhere in these pages, discusses this whisky in greater detail. Suffice it to say, JAMES BOSWELL,

There are but 8 cases of this fabulous 23 Year Old thoroughbred, each bearing its own individual number. In our opinion, it represents the best
single example of Scotch whisky we have tasted for a decade. Act quickly on this one—it probably will be gone within the next two weeks.
