ILLIAM HOGARTH was
born in London in 1697 and
died there 1764, acclaimed within
his own lifetime as one of the
greatest English painters and
printmakers in the history of art.
He is famous for his magnificent
series of engravings, ‘““The Rake’s
Progress’, etc. He secured the
passage of an Act of Parliament
giving painters the right to the
ownership of their own work, thus
establishing a principle of copy-
right ownership for which every
artist since has reason to be
grateful.
Perhaps his most famous en-
graving is ‘‘Gin Lane’’,and it cele-
brates, if that is the right word,

the popularity of Gin in England.
Gin was brought to England by
William III of Orange, when he
was invited to leave his native
Holland and take the throne of
England, in 1688. In the first half
of the 18th century wages were
frequently paid in Gin, sailors
were issued with half a pint a
day, and a gallon of ‘British Gin’
could be bought for nine shillings,
fourpence (about $1.30)! During
these years most Gin was home-
brewed. In 1751 an Act of Parlia-
ment was passed, forbidding the
selling of Gin, and afterwards the
consumption gradually declined,
until the discovery of the cocktail
after the First World War, when
Gin became both popular and
fashionable.

No doubt Hogarth would be
surprised to see just how fashion-
able Gin has*become, although its
popularity would probably not
have surprised him. Ever since
some enterprising Italian first
found a use for the juniper ber-
ries of his native mountainsides
(GINEVRA), it has been the
most popular of spirits, and the
most versatile, taken straight, as
it was in Hogarth’s day, or in
countless mixed drinks.

BOSWELL—THE IMMORTAL

BOSWELL SCOTCH. Coincidently the
firm that made this Scotch was es-
tablished the very year that James
Boswell died—1795. Out of this
heritage comes this remarkable
Scotch Whisky. $5.99 the bottle,

A lawyer by profession, he neg-

English language), and for his
own voluminous diaries, in which
he revealed, with complete frank-
ness, the details of his wild and
intemperate life. Boswell was in
every way a man of his century;
a cultured and intelligent man,
but in frequent and embarrassing
trouble.

It is entirely appropriate to
name a Scotch Whisky after him,
for Boswell was an ardent Scots
man, despite Johnson’s taunt that
the best road a Scotsman ever
sees is the one that leads him to
London. In Boswell’s day Scotch
Whisky still remained something
of a native drink, almost unknown
outside Scotland, where it was
