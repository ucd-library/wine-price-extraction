The new liner, S.S. FRANCE, steamed into the New York harbor
oo on February 8th and was cheered from the shores of the Hudson
euch IW River by enthusiastic Americans. Unknown to its admirers, but of
unusual wine significance, was the fact that comfortably resting in
its temperature-controlled hold was the first shipment of the much-

heralded 1961 vintage to reach the United States.
The wine did not pretend to be a great Claret which still requires
two more years of barrel age, but it had its own sense of dignity.and
s with the pride. It was the beloved light and much-sought-after wine of the
Loire valley—MUSCADET 1961. Here is the wine that is only now
—] reaching the tables of the great restaurants and bistros of Paris
poem and the proprietors are saying to the Parisians: “It has just arrived
—the young, fresh, delicious 1961 Muscadet—it will make your

‘Quenelles de Brochet’ taste that much better.”

This wine, the rage of Paris and the provinces, can now be served,
along the Hudson as well as the Seine. Don’t buy it if you are looking
for a big, full-flavored white wine; however, if you are content with
a wine of breed, crisp dryness, haunting bouquet, and easy drink-
950, ability—here it is—and at its best.
ee? A WORD OF ADVICE—because of the great interest in the 1961
towns of vintage and since this first shipment is not large, we suggest order-
Ing it promptly to avoid disappointment.
