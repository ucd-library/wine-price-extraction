An important sales event is taking place at Sherry’s—the
1959 Burgundies, perhaps the best and most enjoyable of our
lifetime, reached our cellars during last Autumn, bringing
their glory to you—and every one is now on sale!

Here is an opportunity that the wine-lover should not over-
look. Practically no 1959 estate-bottled Burgundy worth ac-
quiring remains in the cellars of the growers. Those that are
still commercially available in Burgundy today command
double the price of our low acquisition cost of a few years ago.

Our advice is to anticipate your needs far ahead, because
the next outstanding year, 1961, which will reach us two years,
hence, will be much more costly than these 1959s, and they
certainly will not be superior. You will discover that even the
lesser Bungundies of 1959 are excellent and the best are
frankly great—an incomparable year, rich in fruit, well-
balanced, ready to be enjoyed immediately and with the further
happy prospect of improvement as they remain in the cellar.
Each wine offered here has been tasted carefully at the vine-
yards and represents the best of Burgundy.

*347 BEAUJOLAIS SUPERIOR 1.29 14.50

Estate bottled Henri Guillot
This is served generously and enthusiastically in the country inns and
bistros of France. Not great, but pleasant and most satisfactory for
everyday drinking.
"ia MOULIN-A-VENT, BURDELINES
Estate bottled, Mousset
The magnificence of the 1959 in the Beaujolais district particularly ex-
pressed itself among the Estate bottlings of the better villages such as
Moulin-a-Vent and Fleurie. This wine is full, slow to develop for a
Beaujolais, fruity, with a perfume rarely achieved in a red wine.
206 FLEURIE, LES MORIERS 1.99 22.65
Estate bottled Mousset

1.99 22.65

Another extraordinary example of great Beaujolais. Estate bottled by
an outstanding producer from vineyards of one of the better villages.
215 SAVIGNY LES BEAUNE,
DOMINAUDES
Estate bottled, Briaille
This is unlike any Savigny-les-Beaune that we have ever run across. It
tastes like an extremely sturdy, well-balanced Beaune of a great vine
yard.
126 MERCUREY

Estate bottled, Baron Thenard

2.19 24.50

2.19 24.50

A red wine of finesse and distinction, delightful when young, and
estate bottled by Baron Thenard. Normally 2.49,

“246 CHATEAU DE MONTHELIE

Estate bottled, Suremain

Just south of Volnay and up a dirt road is the tiny village of Monthelie.
Less known than Volnay, they sometimes achieve the stature of the
good Volnays but cost considerably less. Normally 2.79.

*172 CHAMBOLLE MUSIGNY 2.69 29.75

Estate bottled Domaine Roumier
Alain Roumier, not yet thirty, was elected Mayor of his village, Cham-
bolle Musigny, about a year ago. Like his father before him. he is the
cellarmaster of the Comte de Vogue, but has a few small vineyards of
his own. Handled with great skill and unremitting care, these wines
are of exceptional class. The 1959—light, delicate, bouqueté—is out-

standing.
275 FIXIN, CLOS DU CHAPITRE 2.79 31.50

Estate bottled, Pierre Gelin
A sleeper—though the name is not generally familiar to the wine
lover, a good Fixin can often achieve the stature of its neighboring
vineyard, Chambertin. If you can survive without having a great name
on the label but want good wine, by all means buy this one.

*190 CHAPELLE CHAMBERTIN 2.99
Estate bottled, Clair-Dau
Only a narrow road separates Chapelle-Chambertin from the directly
adjoining Clos de Beze, and when well made, Chapelle-Chambertin is
a true artistocrat, with enormous power and breed.

*827 VOLNAY CHAMPANS 3.29
Estate bottled, Marquis d’Angerville
The Marquis d’Angerville who makes his wines the way the Burgun-
dians did it before the war undoubtedly is the best producer in Volnay.
Some say his “Champans” vineyard provided him with his best in 1959.
In any event, here is a classic wine, of beautiful harmony, that will
be outstanding for many years to come.

*202 POMMARD “CLOS BLANC”
Estate bottled, F. Clerget
The most popular of the Burgundies is certainly “Pommard,” perhaps
because its name is so easy to remember. Most of the commercial ones
that reach the United States lack distinction. An authentic one is hard
to come by. This is an absolute beauty from a superb vineyard, made
by a skilled grower. Normally 3.99.
*484 ECHEZEAUX 3.69 42.50
Estate bottled, R. Engel
An interesting combination of body and strength that will improve
considerably with age. Great class at low cost. Normally 3.99.

*269 POMMARD, LES EPENOTS 3.69
Estate bottled, Domaine Parent

If one were seeking the best vineyard, the Montrachet of Pommard, he

would find it at “Les Epenots” It is the kind of wine because of finesse,

bouquet and world demand that should obtain $5.00. A real bargain
for the wine lover.

226 GEVREY CHAMBERTIN,
CLOS ST. JACQUES
Estate bottled, Clair-Dau

M. Clair-Dau whose cellars are just opposite that wonderful country
restaurant, “Les Gourmets” where the vignerons eat, is a proud vine-
yard owner and controls some of the best properties in Burgundy, 1n-
variably winning one of the Gold Medals at the great agricultural
exposition. M. Clair-Dau tells us that this is his favorite and we think
you will be enamored by its vigor and Chambertin-like strength

270 VOSNE ROMANEE,
CLOS DES REAS
Estate bottled, L. Gros

The distinguished characteristics of the great wines of Vosne are

lingering bouquet and rich, full character. In the masterful hands of

Louis Gros, Mayor of the town, the Clos des Reas vineyard has

achieved the delicacy and balance in this vear that provides classic

distinction.
