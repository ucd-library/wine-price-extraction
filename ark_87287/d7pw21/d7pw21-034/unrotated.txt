SAMUEL CHAMBERLAIN

Samuel Chamberlain has always
been a devoted admirer of France.
His France Will Live Again; Soft
Skies of France; and Flavor of
France, are evidence enough.
Though his eyes may be on France,
his feet are firmly planted on na-
tive American soil. His classic
books and photographs of New
England and Virginia are world
famous.

All of the photographic scenes of
France that you see in this catalog
are the work of Mr. Chamberlain
which originally appeared in his
remarkable book “Flavor of
France” and “Soft Skies of France.”
We can only urge that you acquire
the pictorial charm and well
chosen recipes that appear_in the
“Flavor of France” immediately.
Simply write the publishers,
HASTINGS HOUSE, Port Wash-
ington, L.1,.. . send no money...
the book will be mailed immedi-
ately ... the invoice for $5.95 will
follow later. ...
