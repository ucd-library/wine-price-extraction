| [ane We have fortunately acquired the last re-
maining stocks of this 1943 Champagne —
8 pag
a selected Cuvee by the fine old firm of
| Address MOET & CHANDON to commemorate
their 200th Anniversary. 1943 was an excep-
| City | tional vintage among Champagnes and we
believe it found its best expression in this
Tm ee er rien full flavored, perfectly balanced Bi-

Centenary Cuvee of Moet & Chandon.
