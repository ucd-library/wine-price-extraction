is the young Chablis that is now being
consumed so enthusiastically on the
terraces and auberges in France— by

refreshing continental touch to your
summer entertaining. (2.19 the bot-
tle, 24.50 the case)... and another
1959 coming in at the same time is a
‘Vin Rose” made of the noble Pinot
Noir grape at one of the better vine-
yards of Burgundy —it is Rose de
Marsannay 1959 of Clair-Dau and. in
my opinion, one of the most intrigu-
ing pink wines I have ever tasted
(2.19 the bottle, 24.50 the case)
