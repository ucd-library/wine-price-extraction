Wine lovers everywhere are awaiting the first arrival of the 1959 Beaujolais
and Pouilly Fuisse. This important wine event is now taking place—two 0

the wines are now coming in—the other three are being put in pottle and
will be here by mid-July. te h of these wines was selected by Alexis Lichine,
who was determined to get the best examples that these two popular wine
growing districts had to offer—the two white wines are higher than average
im alcohol, show unsurpassed fruitiness, and will be absolutely delightful
for day-in and day-out drinking during the warm summer days. The three
yeds are extraordinary examples of Beaujolais, exhibiting perfect color,
excellent bouquet, and an abundance of the charming qualities that have
made Beaujolais so popular.

We suggest ordering the Beaujolais Blane and Morgon for immediate de-
ry and the Pouilly, Moulin-A-Vent, and Fleurie for July delivery. We
are certain that this first shipment, because of the great interest in this
i i depleted yapidly—therefore, we urge that you order now to
avoid disappointment and to be among the first to taste these delightful
wines of the 1959 vintage.
