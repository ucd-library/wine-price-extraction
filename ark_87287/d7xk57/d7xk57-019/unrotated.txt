ICED CHAMPAGNE IN LE CAN-CAN...
has won great acclaim by boat voyagers during this
record-breaking tourist season. Seasoned travellers de-
clare that no gift is more appreciated or better-timed—
the iced Champagne arrives at the moment when it is
most needed—before sailing time, when friends are
gathered in the stateroom ready to lift their glasses in
a farewell toast.

Not only is this Bon Voyage gift gay and imaginative,
but it need not even be expensive. Simply pick your
favorite Ch: ampagne on the opposite page (whether ae
be one, three or a dozen bottles) and add only $2.

SHAM ad al to cover the cost of “LE CAN-CAN.”
