19TH CENTURY OLD VINTAGE MADETIRAS

About a year ago we'learned that there was a small treasury of Vintage Madeira |
in the cellars of Blandy in Funchal that dated as far back as the late 18th
Century. We were aware of the importance of this wine among the wine drinkers
of early American history; we had tasted old examples and knew how extra-
ordinarily fine and vigorous they could be; and we resolved that we would
acquire some for our clientele. It took a year of much persuasion to accomplish
the mission, and at long last they are here in all their antiquity and glory.

Here is an epoch-making collection of the world's oldest and most long-lived
wines - wines that are true collector's items as surely as a fine first edition

of a rare old book.

‘

We list below the total number of bottles that are in existence in the world,

the vintage year (and every drop is of the year stated), and the price per bottle,
Quite frankly, we have no precedent to gauge the rate of depletion, but if you
are interested in any particular vintage for your own uSe or as a holiday gift,
we certainly would advise reserving your needs now before the overwhelming
demands of Christmas shopping sets in.

HOLIDAY NOTES ON FRENCH CHAMPAGNE

We do think we should single out the Ayala Brut 1952 as extraordinary value
among the world famous Champagnes and the rare Dom Perignon 1949.

AYALA GOLD LABEL BRUT 1952 4.99 56.50
The Ayala 1952 is superb - completely dry and beautifully balanced. Featured
on wine lists throughout the world. Normally commands $6.95. Suggest
acquiring some at this very low price. For superior holiday entertaining at
modest cost.

MOET & CHANDON DOM PERIGNON 1949 11.00 118.80
Very few cases reached the United States, and this classic Champagne surely
will be unavailable by mid-December. If you should want Dom Perignon for
Christmas, our advise is to obtain it now.
