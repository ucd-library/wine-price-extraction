= From Robert Daley’s Sunday article: “Count Leo de
Malet Roquefort notes with a certain bitterness: ‘My
wine, Chateau La Gaffeliere, sells for around 22,000
francs the tonneau, and Ausone for around 50,000
francs the tonneau. At blind tastings my wine is
consistently first, and beats Ausone.’” Candidly, La
Gaffeliere can not only take on Ausone but Cheval
Blanc as well.
