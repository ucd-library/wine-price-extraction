PINOT CHARDONNAY, LES GCHARMES 1975.......0.......2ec00000. 34.75
For those who want to drink remarkably fine dry white wine at low cost. Won
GOLD AWARD at Paris Fair for being the best Pinot Chardonnay produced in
Macon during the excellent 1975 vintage. Tastes like a $60.00 the case wine. Fea-
tured in practically every good French restaurant in New York City. Superb for
Summer entertaining. :
MUISCAGET SUR4IE 1976 (oe Be 34.75
Estate-bottled at Chateau Briace. Won GOLD AWARD for the best Muscadet of
that year. Dry, clean, light—the kind of wine you serve icy cold instead of a martini
before dinner—particularly when warm weather hits the Hamptons and the South
Shore.
MEURSAULT, CASSE TETE 1973 (Estate of R. Thevenin).............. 68.50
What a wine! Big, vigorous—will compete with the white wines of the Montrachet
area in depth, bouquet, roundness, and Iongevity. For the special occasion.

RED WINES THAT HAVE TO DO WITH OUTDOOR LIVING,
CHARCOAL GRILLING AND PICNICS
COTES DU-RHONE RODGE 1978-5, Pooh a ae 28.40

Will let you in on a secret. This is the very wine that Craig Claiborne serves day-in _
and day-out at his Easthampton gastronomic shrine. Why? He is a man who loves

good red wine that pleases his palate and does not damage his purse too severely.
This is no ordinary red wine from the Rhone Valley but from La Vieille Ferme
which is considered the best single source of red wine in the Avignon area.
SAUMUR CHAMPIGNY 1973 (Domaine de l’Oratoire)................. 29.95
Did you know that the village of Saumur is in the Loire and produces one of the
most charming red wines of France? It is the kind of wine that enlivens the 1-star
and 2-star restaurants of the French provinces. We love it—think it is worth twice
the price-Perfect for warm weather menus.

BEAUJOLAIS 1975 (Marquis de Roussy de Sales)...................-4- 34.10
There is Beaujolais and Beaujolais. Some are poor and some are outstanding. Here
is one of the best and is worth over $4.00 the bottle. Why? It is produced by
Marquis de Roussy de Sales, the proud proprietor of Chateau de La Chaize. Every
drop is from the best soil of the Beaujolais area. It is rich, fruity, and should be
served cool with the hamburgers and steaks as they come off the grill.

SPM CABERNET SALIVIGNON: 1972. 2p se pee Te eee, 53.89
In Sonoma County of California, there is the blessed Alexander Valley which
produces this unbelievably superb Cabernet Sauvignon which can hold its head
high even among the classified growths of Bordeaux. It is the very wine that
Frank Prial placed so high in his Wine Talk column just a week ago. It’s a rationed
wine—we have only 38 cases so we suggest you order quickly.

SPIRITS FOR THE SPIRITED

Not even the most devoted of wine lovers can afford not to have at least a few
bottles of Scotch, Gin, Vodka, Rum, and Bourbon in his pantry. The trick is to
serve outstanding examples at the lowest possible cost. James Beard and Sam
Aaron held a hasty conference on the subject and here are their recommendations.
RACK BAY GIN-60°) ee es pa 46.74
There is no better Gin produced in America and this costs less than the others.
Why pay more? Also available in full quarts —an added saving at $57.74.

BACK BAY VOUKA-@0°. 5380 ee ee 46.74
Vodka may have been born in Russia but this Back Bay version is quite its equal.
Also available in quarts at $57.74 the case.

BARRISTERS GHOIGE 12 YEAR SCOTCH. 320 os 71.76
Johnnie Walker Black 12 year old Scotch sells for $122.16 the case—Chivas Regal
12 year old Scotch sells for $135.48 the case—Barrister’s Choice 12 year old Scotch
sells for $71.76 the case. We have now conducted five blind tastings among these
three, and in every one of these tastings, the Barrister’s Choice 12 year old fared
as well as the two most-advertised thoroughbreds. And the saving is substantia]—
well over $50 the case below either rival. For those who prefer quarts, Barrister’s
Choice 12 year old Scotch is available in full quarts at $83.76 the case.

1972 RED BORDEAUX

Slow to mature, 1972 has been overlooked
until recently. The tannic hardness is disap-
pearing; the fruit and balance are emerging.
Undoubtedly the best buys in great Bordeaux
being. shipped from Bordeaux today. Prices
astonishingly low.

CHATEAU BELGRAVE (Haut Medoc) 33.50

“By noon the dew had been burned off the Petrus
grapes. At I P.M. Moueix threw all 150 pickers into
the remaining Petrus vineyards. Three hours to go.
In came the Petrus grapes. By the time the rain
poured down that afternoon, every single Petrus vine
had been stripped of grapes.” —from the N.Y. Times
Magazine. It is due to this kind of all-out effort that
Chateau Petrus 1972 has consistently been praised
as the best ’72 produced in that year. This wine
wholesales for almost $200 the case in Bordeaux
today.

1969 RED BORDEAUX

1969 is an excellent, but overlooked vintage,
producing fine slow-maturing wines, particu-
larly in the Medoe and Graves. The Chateau
La Mission Haut Brion 1969 at $89.50 the
case, might easily prove the best value in great
red wine on this entire page.

haps less, but your guests, if they know wine, will
applaud your discernment and not just your. pocket-

Sparkling wine from the Haut Savoie. Quite the equal
in dryness and excellence to many French Champagnes
that command over $10 the bottle.

CHATEAU RIEUSSEC 1971

CMMMN EE oS ee Lees, ee 56.90
Outside of Chateau Yquem, this is the best Sauternes
produced in 1971. Dramatically rich.
CHATEAU GLORIA 1975 (St. Julien) 69.95
One of the most heralded wines of the great 1975 vintage
is Chateau Gloria. You can buy it now at only $69.95
and it will be delivered during the Spring of 1978. If
you buy six cases at one time, the cost is only $65.00 per
case for a single six-case delivery.
MICHEL GUERARD CHAMPAGNE

WRN ee a ee 97.09
Michel Guerard’s restaurant, a gastronomic shrine, was.
the only one that was newly awarded the coveted 3-star
category by Guide Michelin. The Champagne served at
this 3-star dining mecca proudly bears the name
CHAMPAGNE MICHEL GUERARD BRUT. It is ele-
gant, bone-dry, perfectly balanced, and is capable of
holding its own against other French Champagnes that
approach $300.00 the case.

CHATEAU MOUTON ROTHSCHILD

Peis a ee 185.00
Pablo Picasso created the 1973 Mouton label and Andy
Warhol is the proud artist who executed the label for this
great 1975—perhaps the best single wine produced in
all of Bordeaux during this extraordinary great vintage.
This 1975 will be delivered in 1978 but you can buy it
now for only $185.00. It will probably approach $300.00
in cost after it is put in bottle and delivered to America.
ROMANEE ST. VIVANT 1972,

Romiunee Conti 6 8 226.26
Starting April Ist, we offer this great Domaine de la
Romanee Conti for only $226.26 the case. The normal
price is $268.92. Only 32 cases exist in America. Red
Burgundy at its noblest with at least 20 years of life
ahead.
