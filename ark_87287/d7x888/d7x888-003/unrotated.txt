In this year of grace 1957, Lon-
don, the respected elder of all
world shopping centres, acclaims
the tradition and characteristic
achievement of one of it’s oldest
institutions — the famous Pic-
cadilly firm of Fortnum &
Mason, celebrating a 250th An-
niversary, as a symbol of quality
throughout the reign of twelve
Sovereigns.

It is with a deep feeling of re-
spect for an old friend, that the
associates of Sherry Wine &
Spirits Co., Inc., of New York.
join with the thousands of dis-
criminating Fortnum & Mason
customers all over the world in
extending heartiest congratula-
tions for past great achievements °
and to wish this unique store
(and its managing director Mr.
David Dennis) a future of con-
tinued prosperity and exclusive-
ness.

To enjoy the friendly, unob-
trusive service proffered by the
impeccable departments of Fort-
num & Mason is to know the full
meaning of elegant shopping.
People of widely different tastes,
Royalty, international aristoc-
racy, V.I.P.’s, the great and
small who like only the best, flow
through this incredible Piccadilly
mecca to obtain every imaginable
foodstuff, fabulous fruits and ex-
otic flowers; perfection in cloth-
ing; a remarkable profusion of
quality sports and kitchen equip-
ment; books, Stationery, toys,

linen, leather, china, glass, rare

wants to leave.
It is our privilege and pleasure

at Sherry’s to present to Amer-

icans the distinguished wines and
spirits of Fortnum & Mason.
Through our close association in
this field we have arranged for
you to receive this delightful and
intriguing history, it only re-
mains for us to say you are cor-
dially invited to visit this centre
of individuality next time you
are in London. It will be an ex-
perience long remembered and
quite unequalled anywhere else.

   

WHEN THE CLANS
GATHER

Highlanders and Sassenachs
alike, whether they gather in
two, threes or ‘clans’, have one
thing in common — the scotch
whisky they consume must be
above reproach, able to warm
the hearts of all who imbibe and
gloriously remembered long
after, no matter at what hour it
is enjoyed. Aware of this high
responsibility to those who know
the ‘water north of the border,’
Fortnum & Mason experts
burned the midnight oil, tasting
and testing, weighing balance,
harmony, richness of flavour and
full maturity until they found
a blend to delight even their most
critical customer.

The result of their efforts,
Fortnum and Mason Red Seal,
now a consistent favorite in Lon-
don is available at Sherry’s and

at $5.99 the bottle, ($68.50 the

and unusual gifts from the na-
tion’s markets and finally a rich
selection of wines and _ spirits
above a 17th Century wine crypt
which will delight any connois-
seur of good drinking. Should
you desire it there is an Amer-
ican styled soda-fountain and a
restaurant which no one ever

whole case) easily surpasses in
quality many scotch whiskies
selling at considerably higher
levels.

 

AS DR. JOHNSON SAID
TO PEPYS
In Pepys diary Dr. Samuel
Johnson is quoted as saying
“Claret is the liquor for boys,
Port for men, but he who aspires
to be a hero must drink Brandy.”
In Dr. Johnson’s time, brandy
cost but a few pence. ‘Today not
everyone aspires to ‘courage’ at
the present cost of Cognac. The
blessedness of becoming a brandy
enthusiast—an experience which
often surprises and delights those
who imagine they have no taste
for it—is well within most peo-
ple’s pockets by virtue of Fort-
num & Mason’s Fine Cham-
pagne Cognac, an unique exam-
ple of delicate good taste, dry-
ness and bouquet. We at Sherry’s
Present this superb English
Market cognac at $6.49 the bot-
tle, ($75.00 the case) knowing
that you will find its subtle ap-
peal irresistible.
