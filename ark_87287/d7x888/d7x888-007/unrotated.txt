Byssyter King’s End.

In 1540 Fortynham even had the pleasure of
paying rent to Henry VIII for one messuage and
one and a half virgates of land, which for all we
know was probably quite a lot. When he died

London had been almost burnt to the
ground. It was clear that a good man could turn
a profit by helping to build it up again. William
established himself as a builder in Stepney, and
began to do commendably well. He even built
Holywell House in St. Albans, and had to sue
