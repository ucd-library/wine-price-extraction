[t might have been Fortanon.
It could have been Fortynham.
It hovered for years

between Fortnam and Fortnane.

It wasn’t until 1707 that it settled down into
Fortnum, collected its Mason, and became the
sweetest sound in the English language for those
countless perceptive thousands who know that
life can be sustained by bread and water, but is
given a sharp, upward boost by the more
imaginative combination of caviar and cham-
pagne.

When an institution reaches its 250th birthday,
as Fortnum & Mason do this year, even the least
curious among the clientele must be tem pted to
wonder how it all began.

The least curious will now kindly strain them-
selves, and pay a little attention, because they
are going to be exposed to the possibility of
finding out. It would be as well, too, if we all
stick closely together, because the Fortnum
family has so many branches there is a danger
of the slower witted among us becoming lost in
the family trees.
