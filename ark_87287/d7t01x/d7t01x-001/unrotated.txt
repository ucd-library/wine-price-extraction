TO GOURMETS AFLOAT

The ocean going passenger on a modern liner

is given an opportunity for the proper en-

joyment of good food and good wine that is

?

rarely matched on land. Free of the pressure
that is ever present on land, the boat trax eller
can concentrate with enthusiasm on the joys
of the ship’s creative dishes and the treasures

sea or when you visit some of the world’s
oreat restaurants after you land. This vin-
tage chart has not been arrived at without
the greatest research and care — if ig the

result of much thought.
