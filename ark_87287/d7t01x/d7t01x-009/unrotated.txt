CHAMPAGNE

1957. Will certainly be - shipped asa Ee
despite a pitifully small crop. The trost of

May, 1957, was disastrous, and the total pro-

duction amounted to less than a quarter of the
Champagne sold during the twelve months

preceding the vintage. The quality was well
above average — it is too early to say more.
1956. Very poor. Under 10 )/20.

1955. Great. Full-bodied wines somewhat re-
sembling the 195 3s, but on the whole perha ApS
better balanced. 17/20.

1954. Fair. Will | not carry a vintage, although
a few vineyards produced Wines rather more
than passable. 12 /20.

19S: Highly touted and extravagantly

praised, especially just at the beginning by the
small vineyard owners, it seems less and less
likely to ae f il] its early promise, and must
now, as t ues ae ys its wines come on the
market, d i 1 oe as below 1952 in
quality. Its wing es are very full, very high in
alcohol; they seem to lack distinction and
grace, and these are qualities which ee
pagnes rarely acquire as they grow ot A
great year, but not an especia ally attractive
wine. 16/2 0.

1952. S very great year, ce ily the best
of the past two decades, quite enact Me to
that so-called “incom parable” year, 1928. The
wines seem to have eve rything — great class,
ee a nice equilibrium of lightness and
body, a charm which m: akes s them immediately
eng gaging and ot her qualities which would
seem to assure then j ong life. 19/ 20 as

minimum.

1951. Very poor. 7/20.

1950. Good. Many wines of finesse and breed
were produced though few carried a vintage.
Now 14/20

1949. Great. Sound, rarely extraordinarv but
extremely well-balanced wines which have de
veloped well, as such wines often do. Wil]
hardly improve further but should remain on
their present high plateau of excellence for
several y ae at te 17720,

1948. Fair. At best 11/20.

1947. A great year except for a few pre-
cious survivors, now on the decline. Ful]
bodied, soft wines that matured early. 13/20
to 16/20 today.

1946. Fair. Now off the market. 10/20.
1945. Matured quickly, grew old quickly. No

longer interesting. 10/20.

LOIRE VALLEY
1957. A disastrous frost struck the Léire Val.
ley in May, 1957, and in most areas no wine
at all was harvested. In a few fortunate dis
nce ouce es Quincy, the crop was extremely
small, but the wine outstanding acs
1 956. Uneven. but in some sections surpris
ingly good — wines that are fruity, light, with
good bouquet, perhaps a bit tart. 12/20 to
14/20.
oe very great year. Lypical, charming
wines, admirably balanced, fruity, racy, not
too sweet. 18/20.
1954. Fair. 12/20.
1953. Great. Ripe, soft white wines now al.

most unprocurable. Red Loires outstanding.
