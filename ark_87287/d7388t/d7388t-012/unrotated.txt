SHERRY

Sherry is a blend of many wines of different years kept together
in the same cask long enough for each to lose its own individuality
and become part of a harmonious whole.

The drier sherries are generally sold under the names of ““Amontil-
lado,” “Fino,” “Vino de Pasto,”” and ‘““Manzanilla.”

The sweeter ones usually are sold under the names of “Amoroso,”
es 99 es 39
Oloroso,” and “Brown Sherry.

As a pleasant substitute for the cocktail, we recommend dry
sherry, particularly when chilled.

Sweet sherry is delightful as dessert or with cheese.
sherry goes well throughout the meal.

We are proud to offer the following list of carefully selected
sherries which we believe is the most complete list available in this
