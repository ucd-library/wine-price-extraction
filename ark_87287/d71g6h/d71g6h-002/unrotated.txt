URING my recent wine trip to France, I was particularly

impressed by the old and reputable Bordeaux firm of DeLuze,
and now I am impressed by their sense of reality and practicality. We
have just received a goodly supply of DeLuze red and white Bordeaux
in the ever-so-useful split or quarter-bottle size. This means you can
use wine at the table or in the kitchen without ever undergoing
the anguish of pouring left-over wine down the drain. Stock your
kitchen with a dozen, and you will now be ready to execute “cooking
with wine” recipes with a flourish. And, here is a recipe that will
bring the best out of chicken and demonstrate the virtues of DeLuze
Bordeaux Red. Cut two medium slices of salt pork into dice and cook
them with three tablespoons butter until nicely browned. Now dredge
a young frying chicken of about two or two and a half pounds with
seasoned flour and brown the pieces of chicken nicely in the fat. When
they are pleasantly colored, salt and pepper to taste, being certain
to remember that the salt pork gives some salt to the dish. Then add
twelve small white onions, peeled, a half a bay leaf, a pinch of
thyme and three or four young carrots, which have been scraped
and cut in half. Then pour over a split of DeLuze Rouge. Cover
and allow it to simmer for forty five minutes or until the chicken
is tender and the onions are cooked through. If you wish the sauce
thicker than it is, you may add small balls of butter and flour kneaded
together in the proportion of one teaspoon flour to two teaspoons
butter. Sprinkle with chopped parsley and serve with rice or noodles.
I am certain you will look with great favor upon this dish.

You will be delighted with the 1947 Montrachet of Comte de
Moucheron. Many of you have waxed poetic about his 1945. We
still have a bit of that remaining as well as the 1947. Both are wines
to be cherished, and we will be lucky indeed if either will be dupli-
cated by any vintage year during the next decade.

RANDOM NOTES :—Those who prefer Scotch to Bourbon will
find much solace in the hit film from Scotland called “Tight Little
Island” which now enlivens the Translux Theatre at Madison
Avenue and 60th Street .. . And speaking of Scotch, have you noticed
the Ballantine 28 Year Old resting in all its mature dignity on our
shelves? I suggest you get some now for that precious occasion, before
it is all gone. . . The simplicity and charm of that delightful pink
wine from Alsace, Dopff Vin Gris ... A fond Bon Voyage to our
associate, Sam Aaron, who has just left for France to spend several
weeks leisurely browsing among the wine growing districts of that
country. We eagerly await his return and look forward to intriguing
tales of vintage and vineyard that he will surely bring back with him

. Those magic numbers “21” evidently are numerical symbols of
good fortune since the demand for “21”? Whiskey and ‘21’ Bourbon
is extraordinarily strong considering the fact that these only made
their debut last Fall . Delighted to see the rested and relaxed
appearance of our wanes Dean upon his return from a short winter
holiday ... The current issue of Reader’s Digest extolls the virtues
of S. S. Pierce Company of New England. This fine old firm has
really earned all the praise which is heaped upon it in this article.
(Incidentally, the article has resulted in fan mail to S. S. Pierce
Company that is taxing the facilities of the Boston Post Office.) As
many of you have already learned, the S. S. Pierce whiskies and wines
are available here. I, personally, am particularly fond of the S. S.
Pierce Straight Kentucky Bourbon, which at $4.49 the bottle, prob-
ably makes it the best fine Bourbon value in town.

If you are not already aware, we are always ready to help you with
plans for entertaining. Whether the party you intend giving is large
or small, we will be glad to help you prepare menus, figure how much
to order, and assist you in selecting the appropriate drinks, punches, or
cocktails. Please phone us, or drop in to the shop, about your dinner

or party problems.
