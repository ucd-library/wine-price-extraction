The great difficulty confronting the buyer of Burgundies is the
bewildering array of wines bearing the same name, but having no
resemblance to each other in quality. This is due to the fact that the
vineyards of Burgundy are parcelled out among many owners, some
of them growers, others traders, and not all of these make the wine
which carries the name of their vineyard. Therefore in Burgundy,
the important factor is the integrity of the grower and the dealer

from whom the wine is obtained.

The Burgundies listed in this catalogue were chosen carefully
from reputable growers and dealers, all of them being duly tested,
and of proven worth. The wines of 1947 will be great wines.
They should not be consumed now but are icon for laying
down. They are cheap today; in the years to come they will be

much more expensive.
