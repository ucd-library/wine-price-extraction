The vineyard cellars of Bordeaux are now hum-
ming with activity as the vignerons proudly
bottle their great 1955s during these winter
months, awaiting the warmer weather of Spring
so that they can dispatch them to knowing
wine drinkers throughout the world. An im-
portant shipment is destined to reach Sherry’s
cellars during April.

During this sale period, we are making avail-
able to our clientele, before the arrival of the
wine, this FIRST OPPORTUNITY to acquire
the best that Bordeaux has to offer at a cost
considerably below the inevitably higher prices
that these wines surely will fetch later this year.
As we see it, the great 1955s (and also 1953s)
cannot avoid ultimately soaring to dizzy heights
because of the disappointing years of 1954 and
1956, as well as the abnormally low yield of
1957.
