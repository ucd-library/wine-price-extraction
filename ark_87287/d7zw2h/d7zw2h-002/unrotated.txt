Considered one of the most typical and attractive of all Beaujolais because of its freshness, full
body, sturdiness and purple-red color. It is the kind of wine that the ruddy-faced growers seek
out at the good local restaurants that dot the countryside between Macon and Lyon.

Burgundy has its Chambertin and Clos Vougeot. Beaujolais has its “Moulin-a-Vent”—far and
away the most long-lived and best red wine grown in the area——and always considerably more
expensive than any of its neighbors. This wine is only now coming into its own and will prob-

and depth of flavor—all coupled with finesse. It can hold its own with a classic red Burgundy
