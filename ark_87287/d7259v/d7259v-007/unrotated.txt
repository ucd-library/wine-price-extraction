1266 MARG DE BOURGOGNE (Domaine de la Romanee Conti) a eG 96.50 |

oo
Here is a flavorful, hearty Brandy, distilled from the grape pressings
of the greatest Cote d'Or Domaine of all, that of Romanee Conti.
Very little of it is made, and the best is hard to come by. This one
has been aged for over ten years, and has every quality that the
discriminating drinker would require from a top flight Marc. Very

limited quantity available.

1250 SINGLE CASK UNBLENDED (1929 Vintage) 9.98 £15700

Here is an estate bottled Cognac that was produced during a great
nm

vintage year (1929) in the most celebrated part of the SS
country, "Grand Fine Champagne". Cognac of this calibre is
dif ficult to obtain because no more than a few small growers have
the patience and aptitude to put aside, year aie year, ]

of their outstanding vintages.

Since the early 19th Centuryit has been the custom of the Hine

Family to set aside the best of their Cognacs of a particularly

outstanding year for their own future use. For the first time

Francois Hine has consented to part with a few of these treasured

bottles - each is numbered and bears a back label relating the

unique history of the contents, and signed by a Hine director.

not ignored this direction and list below good wine in the large Magnum bottle - and at low

cost.
