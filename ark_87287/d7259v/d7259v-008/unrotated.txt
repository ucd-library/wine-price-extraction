__ WHITE BURGUNDY

Bottle
BEAUJOLAIS BLANC 1959 (Estate bottled, M. Robert) 1.99
Exceptional fruitiness, a perfectly composed wine, full - very fine.
PETIT CHABLIS 1959 (Estate bottled, H. Laroche) a: AS
Crisp, clean, dry and delicate. An excellent 1959 that is typical of
fine Chablis.
POUILLY FUISSE, CLOS REISSIER, 1959 back?
Estate bottled, Mathias
We first tasted this glorious 1959 Pouilly at the vineyard last June.
In our opinion, it is one of the best wines we have tasted from this
district in a decade - and is being offered at a price that makes it
particularly pleasing.
MEURSAULT BLAGNY 1953 (Domaine de Blagny) 2,49
Estate bottled, and from one of the great vineyards of Meursault -
unusual lightness, delicacy and finesse - a wine of distinction
produced during an exceptional year.
CHABLIS BOUGROS 1958 (Estate bottled, M. Servin) 3.69
Authentic Chablis is one of the most difficult of wines to come by.
Here is a classic example, estate bottled by a master grower.
PULIGNY MONTRACHET, LES PUCELLES, 1958 3709

Estate bottled, Julien Monnot

Mr. Monnot probably produces less white wine than almost any grower,
but the wines that carry his labels are treasures indeed. This 1958 is
superb, exhibiting great freshness, charm, with pronounced bouquet
and distinction.

CHASSAGNE MONTRACHET, LES RUCHOTTES, 1957 3.89
Estate bottled, Claude Ramonet
The vineyard name comes from the name "Ruche", or "Beehive"; a
great white wine of a great year, with a bouquet and flavor reminiscent
of the scent of a particularly fine honey made from mountain flowers.

CORTON CHARLEMAGNE 1957 (Domaine Martray) 5.09
Corton Charlemagne yields a tiny production and on the steepest of
slopes. You will be delighted by its depth of flavor, indisputable
distinction and subtle bouquet.

MEURSAULT, CLOS DES PERRIERES, 1937 o.39
Estate bottled, Albert Grivault
Many authorities consider Clos des Perrieres (43 acres) the best single
vineyard of Meursault. Aconsistent favorite among fanciers of white

Burgundies.

BATARD MONTRACHET 1957 (Estate bottled, J. Bavard)
Separated only by a narrow country lane from its more celebrated
brother, "Le Montrachet", this classic wine has the distinction

and stature of a truly great white Burgundy.
