Back in 1831, when S. S. Pierce Co. modestly started,
Andrew Jackson was President of the United States, Abraham Lincoln had just become
21, and the national debt was not quite $50,000,000. During the 118 years that have
stnce elapsed, S. S. Pierce Co. has developed a national reputation for integrity, high
quality, and honest value.
