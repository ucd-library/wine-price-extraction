the Guests and Maskers

CapuLeT. Welcome, gentlemen! Ladies that have their
toes
Unplagued with corns will have a bout with you.

Ah ha, my mistresses! Which of you all

Will now deny to dance? She that makes dainty,
d d

She, P’ll swear, hath corns; am I come near ye now?
Welcome, gentlemen! I have seen the day
That I have worn a visor and could tell
A whispering tale in a fair lady’s ear,
Such as would please. ’Tis PONG, tis Gone tis gone!
You are welcome, gentlemen! Come, musicians, play.
A hall, a hall! Give room! and foot it, girls,

Music plays, and they dance
More light, you knaves; and turn the tables up,
And quench the fire, the room is grown too hot,
Ah, sirrah, this unlooked-for sport comes well,
Nay, sil, ney, sit, good cousin Capulet ;
For you and I are past our dancing days.
How long is’t now since last yourself and I

Were in a mask?
