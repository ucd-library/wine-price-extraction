THE TEMPEST
ACT

SCENE I Another part of the island

Enter ALFONSO, SEBASTIAN,
ANTONIO, GONZALO, ADRIAN,
FRANCISCO, and others

GONZALO. Beseech you, sir, be merry; you have cause,
So have we all, of joy; for our escape
Is much beyond our loss. Our hint of woe
Is common: every day some sailorâ€™s wife,
The masters of some merchant and the merchant
Have just our theme of woe; but for the miracle,

[ mean our preservation, few in millions

Can speak like us. Then wisely, good sir, weigh
Our sorrow with our comfort.
