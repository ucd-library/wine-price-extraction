MIDSUMMER NIGHT’S DREAM

ACT di SCENE ds

TiraNniA. Be kind and courteous to this gentleman ;
Hop in his walks and gambol in his eyes ;
Feed him with apricots and dewberries,
With purple

The honey-ba

grapes, green figs, and mulberries ;

gs steal from the humble-bees,

And for night tapers crop their waxen thighs
ce °

And light them at the fiery glow-worm’s eyes,
Cc oO /

To have my love to bed and to arise ;
And pluck the wings from painted butterflies
To fan the moonbeams from his sleeping eyes,

Nod to him, elves, and do him courtesies.
