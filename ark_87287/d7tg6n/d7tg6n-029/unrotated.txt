“BC.” We salute these two great
Cognacs! The SINGLE CASK is un-
blended and of the 1934 vintage.
The GASTON BRIAND is of the
1906 vintage and perhaps the great-
est Cognac coming from France.
Very rare and wonderful.

tually of metal. Decorative,

useful wastebasket. Com-
fortably holds 2 or 3 bottles.
