HE happy merger of SHERRY WINE & SPIRITS CO.
INC. and M. LEHMANN, INC. will provide added joy

this Christmas to the discriminating wine and spirit
drinkers of New York.

 

We happily report that the well-informed, highly-experienced, and eager-
to-help associates of both organizations, will be here to offer personal, courte-
TR, ous, and considerate services whether it be Christmas shopping, or selecting
ee the right bottle of wine for dinner tonight.

The selection of wines and spirits which you will find here is generally

regarded as the most complete in the land and perhaps without equal even in

16, Europe. Current regulations permit us to quote the prices of wines but prohibit

k un us from indicating prices for spirits. Although the prices cannot be stated,
you may be assured that they will be offered at the lowest levels that prevail

16.75 in New York. Write, phone, or visit us for the current price of your favorite
whiskies.

16,75 We invite you to visit us — please come in and leisurely browse among

the largest selection of Christmas Gift ideas that we have ever offered.

5.00 And now, to all our friends at the Yuletide, we extend the Warmest
a de Seasons Greetings!
