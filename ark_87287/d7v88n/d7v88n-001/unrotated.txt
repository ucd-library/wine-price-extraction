THE TOSH

One of the lightest and finest
whiskies you have ever tasted. A
wonderful whisky distilled and
blended in Scotland, imported in
the cask and bottled here to save
you money on taxes. Only this
fact makes it possible to offer
such high quality at this unbe-
lievably low sale price. 80 proof.

REGENCY

Fully matured, blended and
shipped by one of Scotland’s finest
and oldest firms, this light whisky
compares favorably with any
$6.50 whisky. Even at its regular
price it is an excellent value. At
the sale price it is an unbelievable
bargain!

SAVOY HOTEL 8 yrs. old
You pay only pennies more for
this remarkable blend of 8 to 15
year old whiskies than you do for
just an ordinary scotch.
