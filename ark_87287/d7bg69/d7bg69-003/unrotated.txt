This summer, you can serve one of Scotland’s most distinguished whiskies and yet pay only remarkably LoCo e of ALY
$4.59. Its pedigree is beyond challenge, it is a superior product that was blended and bottled in Scotland by the 178 year old 1

firm of Alexander Sommervall. We suggest a case or two before July 15th. Regularly $4.99.

1425 GLEN ALAN (Bottled in Scotland). .......- =. =. 489 57.50 imu

No ordinary Scotch this! A fully matured whisky bottled by one of Scotland’s finest distilleries and imported by S.S. Pierce
Co, Recommended unreservedly to the discriminating Scotch drinker.

Many of you have developed great affection for this truly distinguished Scotch whisky from the 250 year old London firm
of Fortnum & Mason. Only last month, many cases were sold at a higher level. We could not refrain from including this
Scotch thoroughbred, a favorite among the whisky drinkers of London, in our summer sale. Surely the equal of many Scotches
that sell for $7.00 or more. Undoubtedly, the best value in well balanced, fine old Scotch whisky that prevails anywhere in
the New York area.
