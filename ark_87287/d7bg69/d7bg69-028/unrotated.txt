mentioning this service at this
time, is because some of you may
be moving far out to Long Island,
or somewhere upstate, and will
want to take advantage of this
‘Annual Spring-Summer Sale’.
Simply tell us the date you want
delivery and your wishes will be

carried OUG.

BOTTLE BROWSING: From
La Romanee, a tiny two acre vine-
yard that is a Burgundian jewel,
comes a few precious cases of
matchless 1953 red Burgundy. If
you are uncompromising in insist-
ing on the best, by all means
acquire a case and put it away for
this winter...alas, I must advise
you that one of the great Cham-
pagnes of our times, Bollinger Brut
1952, goes up $10 a case on Sep-
tember Ist, and will be just a fond
memory by January. If this be one
of your favorites, I suggest doing
something about it by this Summer
... the La Tache 1954 of Romanee
Conti is still one of my favorite
bottles of great red Burgundy...
the Chateau Petit Village 1955
greets the palate with all of the big-
ness, roundness and depth asso-
ciated with great Pomerol... for
those who wish to maintain a high
standard in their Scotch Whisky

a charming continental flavor.

RANDOM OBSERVATIONS:

Friends speak glowingly of the
magnificent two page color pho-
tograph of our newly discovered
century-old cellars that illustrated
the recent picture “Cook Book”
issued by the editors of LIFE Mag-
azine ...the Barry Gray show, that
appears nightly on radio station
W MCA, reports a heavy volume of
mail commenting favorably on the
wine discussions that have taken
place monthly since the first of the
year. Thus far, these two-hour dis-
cussion panels have included, be-
side myself, such well informed
wine authorities as Alexis Lichine,
Frank Schoonmaker, H. Gregory
Thomas, and Sam Aaron, my genial
associate at Sherry’s... good wine
in the half bottle has become a
growing fashion...your Collins
will be improved if you use an
oversized 12 ounce glass, add extra
gin, rum or whiskey, and make
certain it is icy cold... news for the
June Bride—or rather, her father—
we have just received another ship-
ment of the remarkable Pommery
& Greno Cuvee Albert Brut — the
driest and most delicate of Cham-
pagnes—a remarkable wine that
sells for only $5.99 the bottle,

Champagnes, we feel that we com-
pletely disprove the charge that
the great Champagnes of France
are too expensive when we offer
the world famous Ayala Gold Label
Brut 1952 at only $4.99 the bottle.
