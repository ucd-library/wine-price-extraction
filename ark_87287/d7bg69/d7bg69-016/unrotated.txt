397 SYLVANER 1955 (Caves Hanhart) . . . 1.29 14.50

Here is a typical Alsatian wine made from the Sylvaner grape—fresh, young,
exceptionally light and delightful. A perfect choice for “Spritzer”, terrace
dining, and picnic lunches.

454 RIESLING 1955 (Caves Hanhart) . .... . 1.49 16.95
Riesling is one of the two greatest of all white wine grapes and particularly
thrives among the steep hills of Alsace, where it produces a dry wine of
unusual charm. Here is an excellent example at a price that will permit
serving freely this summer.

 

476 GEWURZTRAMINER 1955 (Caves Hanhart) 1.79 19.95
The most highly regarded grape of the district is the Gewurztraminer which
yields a wine not quite as dry as the Riesling, but with a bouquet that is
more prominent and more highly perfumed. This wine would be an excep-
tional value at $2.25.

Adivondacks 400 FLEUR D’ALSACE 1955, Hugel . . . . . 1.79 19.35

Here is the kind of gay, fresh wine that is sold ‘en carafe’ in the local res-
taurants and inns of Alsace. A superior blend of various grape varieties
grown along the foothills of the Vogue Mountains.

(F. Hugel) ee ee
We herald this remarkable Alsatian wine as the best single example of white
wine we have ever tasted from the district. An extraordinary 1955 that can
rank with the great vineyards of the Rheingau. Enthusiastically recom-

mended for those who want superb Alsatian wine—you will be amazed
On avi by its stature and breed.

MAY WINE ee @
he Hampions 606 GERMAN MAY WINE (Gebrueder Lob)... 1.29 14.50

One of the most provocative aromas in the garden during the spring is one
which few people associate with drinking. They inhale the fresh, tingling
aroma of the woodruff plant, but never quite associate it with the bouquet
of “May Wine’. This one has just reached us from the Rhine—we opened
a bottle and were intrigued by the garden-fresh tang which greeted us, the

smell of woodruff. We happily inform you that is costs but $1.29—a delight-
C5 { ful and inexpensive wine to serve chilled as an aperitif during the coming
warm days.
