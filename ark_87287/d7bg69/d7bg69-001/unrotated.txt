selves to the principle of offering wines and spirits of indisputable origin and
merit at the lowest prices. The wisdom of this long range policy has been con-

firmed by the gratifying growth in our clientele from year to year.

And now, in the Spring of 1959, one of the most exceptional SALE OPPOR-
TUNITIES OF OUR HISTORY. In general, there have been substantial cost
increases at the vineyards and distilleries, but we have rolled back the prices
of many items to reflect our original cost, and not what the present market
should dictate. We strongly advise the acquisition of your Spring and Summer

requirements at these low sale prices.

 

Amazing, dramatic cellars that have
been in existence over a century
right here in New York, near the
Hudson River. The cellars, medie-
val in character, the equal of the
best we have seen in Europe — be-
cause of the 45 feet depth below the
earth, maintain on even tempera-
ture of about 55 degrees throughout
the year.

Built before the Civil War by a
brewery, we were amazed by the
architectural beauty— vaulted ceil-
ings of stone and arches of brick. In

our opinion, these conditions are
unmatched anywhere in the country
for the proper storage of wines.

The wines and spirits that are being
offered are presently resting in these
op deep cool cellars, ready to offer

) sane | their delightful qualities to add joy
