Wine lovers everywhere sing the praises of the better 1961 Beaujolais and"
Pouilly Fuisse. We list below two superb red wines from Beaujolais—the
Moulin A Vent and Fleurie—and do not overlook the classic 1961 Pouilly
Fuisse for warm weather drinking—nor one of the pest pink wines We
have ever tasted, the Beaujolais Rose 1961.

Each of these wines was selected by Alexis Lichine, who states, “Some
of the best Beaujolais I have ever tasted in my lifetime was produced
during 1961—the wines are typical, firmer than the 1959, longer-lived,
with a classic vigor that will delight the wine lover.”

The production during this great vintage year was small, the better
wines are hard to come by, and the prices at the vineyard are record-
breaking. Nevertheless, by quantity purchasing, we have managed to
keep the prices down at a modest level. You will find all four of these
ieee delightful for day-in, day-out drinking during the summer days
ahead.
