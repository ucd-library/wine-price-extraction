Our ‘little man’ takes his wines and spirits
very seriously. He does not permit a single
bottle to reach us unless he has tasted it
carefully and is satisfied with its intrinsic
merit and its authenticity. Having a col-

lector’s instinct, he keeps a constant look-

out for the unusual and exceptional. Being

a wise and experienced buyer, he is able
to offer you his selections at the lowest

possible prices,

The finest wines of Burgundy have a rich, full body and a glorious bouquet and
flavor. At their best, they have no superiors and few equals among any wines o
the world.

Unfortunately, fine Burgundy, both red and white, comes from a very restricted
area tn France and the production is necessarily small. Authentic Burgundy is always
rare, but the reward of a fine bottle of genuine Burgundy makes the search worth while.
We believe that the Burgundies offered here are, each of them, the finest in their

class obtainable today.
