2. FRANK PRIAL’S WINE COLUMN (New York Times,

26th Wine Auction at Christie’s sold a record 32,000 cas
Simon, prominent importer, commented ‘were it not for the |

the $5 or $6 category would be selling for $8 —
30%-40% higher than for 1974’s’, . .
than Mr. Simon estimates, pushing prices

April 14, 1976) reports “March 25th and
€s, some at the highest prices ever . .
arge inventories, most wines now selling in
the opening prices for the 1975’s in Bordeaux were
some wine industry observers see prices be driven up faster
for classified growths to fairly high levels by next fall.”

: Ab

Sherry-Lehmann’s advice to the wine lover is to acquire his favorite Bordeaux and Burgundies now while

the selection is large and the prices still remain low.

RHINES AND MOSELLES ON SALE—We agree with
Frank Schoonmaker’s appraisal that, with the exception
of the incomparable ’71’s, the 1973 vintage in Germany
is undoubtedly the best year in the last decade. The Mo-
selles are sprightly, the Rhines are rich, and all are de-
signed to bring joyous pleasure to your Spring-Summer
dining. = .

We quote from the just released book THE JOYS OF
WINE written by Clifton Fadiman and Sam Aaron.
*““When future observers survey the history and develop-
ment of wine in the United States, I believe they will label
the latter half of the twnetieth century the dawn of -the
Golden Age of American wine.” Though these classic
wines from the best vineyards of America are not on sale,
practically ali of these are worthy of being included here.
They are American glories that are highly rationed even
in California, hard to come by, and represent outstanding
values for those who seek the best, regardless of country
of origin, because of intrinsic merit.
