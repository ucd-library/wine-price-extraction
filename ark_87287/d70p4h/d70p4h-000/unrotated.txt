PLAIN FACTS ABOUT
LIQUOR AND WINE PRICES
IN NEW YORK STATE

Dear Sir:
We are grateful for your interest in learning about our current prices on Whiskies.

Based on our thorough comparative shopping, the evidence comes in clearly that no other shop
in New York, regardless of reputation for selling at a discount, offers a wider range of nation-
ally advertised spirits at low sale price, then here at ‘Sherry's’.

The ultimate test, of course, rests on statistical research which few of us have time to indulge
in. The most helpful thing we can do for you at this point is to simply list below the more
prominent items in our shop that are presently on sale -- and we should alert you that these
sale prices end on Saturday, December lOth.
