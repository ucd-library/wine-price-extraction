CENTURY OLD CELLARS
DISCOVERED BY SHERRY’S-

FOUR LEVELS BELOW EARTH

Here is a story to fascinate all wine lovers
— our associate Jack Aaron, equipped only
with a sledge hammer, smashed through 28
inches of stone below our present under-
ground warehouse space and found amaz-

ing, dramatic cellars that have been in
existence over a century right here in New
York, near the Hudson River. The cellars,
medieval in character, the equal of the best
we have seen in Europe—because of the 45
feet depth below the earth, maintain an
even temperature of about 55 degrees
throughout the year.

Built before the Civil War by a brewery, we
were amazed by the architectural beauty—
vaulted ceilings of stone and arches of brick
(only a small section of these vast cellars
are shown in this photograph). In our op-
inion, these conditions are unmatched any-
where in the country for the proper storage
of wines.
