LOIRE VALLEY, CONT’D.

1952. Very good in Sancerre and Pouilly
Fume; above average in Vouvray. 16/20 to
13/20.

With a few rare exceptions — the extraor-
dinary, rather sweet 1947s and 19455 —_
the Loire wines of years prior to 1952 are of
no further interest.

ALSACE

1957. Good. Only a little over half of a nor-
mal crop, but the quality promises to be supe-
rior to 56, comparable to ’55.
1956. Fair. Small wines, rather high in acid.
13/20,
1955. Uneven but on the whole quite good,
especially the Gewurztraminers. Dry wines,
some a little on the tart side, clean, fresh, at-
tractive. 15/20.
1954. Fair. Mostly consumed en carafe when
pune. 15 720.
1953. A Hae year. Unusual fruit and flavor,
good body. Excellent today but will not last.

COTES DU RHONE

1957. Great. Very small crop but top quality.
At least 17/20.

1956. Fair. Rosés fresh, light, rather tart,
attractive — 15/20. The other wines medi-
ocre. 12/20.

1955. Very great. The admirable rosés have
already been delighting us for nearly a year;
the sturdy, well-balanced reds and whites are
developing in fine style and will continue to
improve. 18/20.

1954. When it comes to vintages, the Rhone
is a law unto itself. Unlike all other French
districts, it produced better wines in 1954
than in 1953. Rarely exported, but at least
16/20.

1953. Uneven. Chateauneuf-du-Pape (due to
bad weather at vintage time) below average,
11/20. Hermitage and Céte Rétie much bet-
ter, 15/20. Rosés good but now past their
prime, 12/20.

1952. Very great. Reds and whites of out-
standing quality, 18/20. Rosés well over the
hill.

OLDER VINTAGES
Authentic Rhone wines of years prior to

1952 are not easy to find. The rosés in any
case, have long since lost their freshness and
charm. A few white Hermitages of 1950 and
1947 have held up very well, though they are
no longer improving. The same thing is true
of the reds of 1950, 1947, 1946. Certain
1949 reds are now excellent and the rare.
genuine 1945s are magnificent, although most
of them have thrown a heavy sediment and
are hard to handle
