RED BURGUNDY

1957. An extremely good year, possibly
great, still hard to judge. Some red Burgundy
vineyards (unlike the white, and unlike all
other major French wine districts) produced
a full normal crop; the wines are sturdy and
firm, will mature less rapidly than the ’55s
and ’53s, may well prove remarkable. As a
guess, at least 15/20 or 16/20.

1956. Extremely poor in red wines (the
whites are another matter — see below);
hardly any of the better growers estate-bottled
their wines, and few of them rate even 10/20.

1955. A great year but a very uneven one;
there are some magnificent bottles, but the
greatest care should be exercised in selecting
and buying. The authentic and truly fine
estate-bottlings are already expensive; many of
those from the Cote de Nuits and a few from
the Céte de Beaune are quite in a class with
the 1953s. 16/20 to even 18/20; many of
them already quite drinkable and fine. The
overall range is perhaps 14/20 to 17/20; they
will all mature early and be short-lived.
1954. Of no possible interest. A few sound
wines. 11/20.

1953. A very great year, quite possibly the
best vintage since the war. Wines that arc
very like the 1929s and 1934s of treasured
memory — full of warmth and fruit and
charm. They have matured quickly, and most
of them are ready; they will be magnificent
for the next three or four years but they will

almost certainly prove, in the long run, short
lived. 19/20.

RED BURGUNDY, CONT’D.

1952. A great year, overshadowed by 1953,
as it probably always will be. Extremely well-
balanced wines, now ready, consistently very
good, rarely extraordinary, may outlast the
’53s but, except in rare instances, unlikely to
achieve the peak quality of 1953’s finest.
Among the best values in today’s market.
16/20.

1951. Very poor. Few ever carried a vintage.
10720.

1950. Fair. Passable, lesser wines, no longer
available. 12/20.

1949. A very good year, proving on the
whole a little disappointing as it grows older.
The best are big, sturdy Burgundies that some-
how seem unable to achieve the softness and
bouquet that we expected of them. They may
dry up before they blossom. Now 15/20.

1948. Fair. No longer commercially avail-
able. 11/20.

1947. A year like no other in our lifetime,
especially on the Céte de Beaune, which pro-
duced wines the equals of which we are not
likely to see again. The few, precious survivors
should be drunk at once, not laid away —
they will soon be past their peak. Magnificent
but undependable —- now somewhere between
20/20 and 0/20.

1946. Good year, now too old. 12/20.

1945. A very great year, the exceedingly rare
estate-bottlings often still improving, and mag-
nificent. 18/20.
