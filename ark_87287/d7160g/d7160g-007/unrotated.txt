BEAUJOLAIS

These engaging and eminently drinkable
wines are perhaps Burgundies as far as their
geographical origin is concerned, but they are
made from a totally different grape and their
qualities and their evolution are as different
from Chambertin’s, for example, as day from
night. In most cases, the younger they are the
better (bad years like 1954 and 1956, of
course, being excepted); many Frenchmen
drink them cheerfully and copiously in the
twelve months following the vintage. 1952
and 1953 were both good years; both now,
however, are showing signs of age, and 1955
is the thing to look for. 1957 produced a very
small crop and the wines, already expensive,
promise to be rather untypical: sturdy, slow-
maturing, perhaps lacking in fruit and charm.

WHITE BURGUNDY

1957. It is still a little early for final judge-
ment, but, in quality, 1957 will almost cer-
tainly rank as a great year. Quantity is another
matter — the crop, everywhere, was extremely
small, and in Chablis (hit by a May frost) al-
most a total catastrophe.

1956. Uneven but surprisingly good — far,
far better, at least, than was at first expected.
The wines are rather small, but on the whole
light, fresh, somewhat tart, agreeable, soon
ready, most of them not, as was feared, either
green or harsh, Perhaps 14/20.

WHITE BURGUNDY, CONT'D.

1955. An excellent year which is exceeding
our high expectations and proving superior
even to 1953. In Pouilly-Fuissé, Pouilly-Vin-
zcelles and Chablis, the wines were soon ready
(most of them have been drunk up by now),
light and bouquetés; they will not last. The
Meursaults and Montrachets have developed
in grand style, and manv of them are admir-
Able. 17/20.

1954. Mediocre, except in a few outstanding
vineyards. 13/20.

1953. Great wines now rapidly growing old;
softer, less well-balanced than the 1952s, al-
though some top wines are still remarkable.
16/20. Chablis (another frost year, small
crop) still holding up very well. 18/20.

1952. Sensationally great. Classic wines of a
quality unsurpassed in the last three decades.
Even these should be drunk, not laid away.
The best of them are at their peak, 20/20; the
smaller wines, now a little tired, perhaps 14/
20 or 15/20.

OLDER VINTAGES

White Burgundies older than the 1952s are
today a poor risk. Even the best of the 1950s,
1949s and 1947s — those that have gained a
golden mellowness and bouquet over the pass-
ing years — have lost, in freshness and fruit,
as much as they have gained otherwise. Pre-
vailing expert opinion now sets ten years as
almost the extreme life-span of white Bur-
gundies, and most of us prefer them between
the ages of two and seven.
