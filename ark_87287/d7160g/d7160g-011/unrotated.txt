RHINE AND MOSELLE

1957. Far from great, but vastly better, at
least, than such disastrous recent years as 56
and ’54. The Rhines promise to be somewhat
better than the ’55s; the Moselles perhaps a
shade less good, though it is too early to judge.
A very short crop, especially in Rheinhessen
(the Liebfraumilch country). Certain to be
expensive, quality considered.

1956. Hardly any natural Ce., unsugared )
wines were produced. Poor. 10/20.

1955. Excellent on the Moselle — attractive,
light, flowery wines, rather on the dry side,
well-balanced, and astonishingly low in alco-
hol, which of course makes them easy to drink.
They range from 7% to 92 % alcohol by vol-
ume but make up in fragrance what they lack
in authority. 16/20 or better. The Rhine
wines, severely damaged by an October frost
which struck three weeks before the vintage,
are spotty and much less successful. In general
12/20, with exceptional Rheingaus running
up to 14/20.

1954. One of the poorest on record. 8/20.

1953. A very great year, presently at its peak.
Only the Spatlesen and Auslesen should now
be considered for laying away; the others
drunk fairly soon, since, despite their charms,
they will be short-lived. The Moselles, typical,
fragrant and fine, rate at least 18/20; the
Rhines, especially those from the Palatinate,
or Pfalz, are even better, 19/20, and are the
only really great and still dependable Rhines
available.

1952. A very good year. Wines a little less
ripe and fruity than the ’53s, have lasted well
but are now beginning to decline. Perhaps
14/20 today.

1951. Generally poor, now off the market.
10/20.

1950. A good year, light and pleasant wines,
most of them now too old, worth only 11/20.

1949. An incomparable year which soon, alas,
will be only a memory. Originally 20/20. The
Auslesen, Beerenauslesen and Trockenbeeren-
auslesen are, for the most part, still remark-
able; the others, unfortunately, of dubious
value.

OLDER VINTAGES

Among German wines older than the ’49s
only a few rare exceptions have more than an
academic interest in 1958 — perhaps only the
very greatest Rheingaus of 1945. The others
are history.
