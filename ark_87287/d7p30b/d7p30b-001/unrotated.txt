A wide selection of Europe's ''vin du pays" below $1.00 the bottle!

These gay, delightful wines of France, Italy and Germany, make no pretense to greatness -
they are wines that are proudly served you in the country inns of Europe. Each is a pleasant,
satisfying, all-purpose table wine with its own individual charm (note that none of these wines
are too old and beyond their prime, nor are they of doubtful vintage year).

We strongly hold to the opinion that there is room in the closet or cellar of the New York wine
drinker for good wines below $1. 00 the bottle that he can serve freely and without hesitation - |
here they are; all are offered at 97¢ the bottle; choose among them: -
