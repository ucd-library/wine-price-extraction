Though it is generally supposed that all of the
Berncasteler Doktor vineyard is owned by Dr.
Thanisch, the truth of the matter is that Deinhard
possessed over 50% of this famous growth since the
beginning of the century. Interestingly enough, to
acquire this important wine holding, Deinhard had to
pay 100 gold marks for each vine, the highest price
ever recorded. This particular bottling of Deinhard,
bearing the Lilac Seal, demonstrates dramatically
the heights that can be achieved by a great Moselle
during a great year such as 1953. Quantity limited.
