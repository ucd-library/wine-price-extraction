“Buy a few casks of
the 1964 vintage
to lay down. It will
be as great as 1921.”

M. PISANI, FRENCH MINISTER OF AGRICUL-
TURE, SPEAKING TO HIS CABINET COL-
LEAGUES, JULY, 1964.

Triggered by such extravagant praise
from so high a source, and encour-
aged on every hand by almost ideal
growing conditions throughout
France, it is no wonder that the for-
eign and domestic press were quick
to dub 1964 — “The vintage of the
century.”

Business Week advised its readers,
“The best wine crop in years—start
your own collection.” “French fore-
see a great vintage’’, headlined an
optimistic report in the New York
Times, to which the London Times
added, “1964 is going to provide a
haughty and superlative bottle.”

Our own initial tastings in the chais
and cellars of the most important pro-
ducers in France indicate that 1964
is indeed a year of excellence. If it is
not quite “The vintage of the cen-
tury’’, certainly it deserves to be
called the most attractive vintage of
the century. There follows our critical,
on-the-spot evaluation of the vintage,
together with some specific com-
ments on the Burgundies, Beaujolais
and Loire wines that we are pleased
to offer at this time.

A moist spring, followed by a hot,
dry summer, kept the grapes free of
disease. Rains in August and Sep-
tember swelled the grapes, balanced
acid and sugar content, and resulted
in bountiful harvests generally. The
vendange (grape gathering) began
three weeks earlier than usual in Bur-
gundy: on September 20th for white
and five days later for red.

As is customary with such a preco-
cious year, the vendange was carried
out under ideal conditions, but not
without difficulties. Ripe grapes, full
of sugar, plus very warm September
temperatures resulted in fast and
furious fermentation. At such times,
extra careful tending is needed, but
similar experiences with the equally
ebullient 1947s and 1959s proved
most useful to the vintners. Similarly,
skill and experience must be exer-
cised in choosing such wines. Those
that follow result from repeated
tastings and careful selection.

Because of the exceptionally hot sum-
mer, the 1964s are low in acidity and
are therefore delightfully soft, deli-
ciously fruity, elegant wines that will
develop quickly. (The 1964 Beau-
jolais, for instance, can be enjoyed
this spring). The vintage is surely the
equal of the rich 1959s, although per-
haps lacking the classic depth and
balance of the superb 1961s. What’s
more, 1964 produced a large amount
of wine in Burgundy and Beaujolais
(welcome news for consumers!), with
somewhat less bountiful harvests in
the Loire and Pouilly Fuisse.

Red Burgundy

Excellent soft wines, similar to the
1959s and 1962s. They will be ready
to drink earlier than the 1961s.

White Burgundy

Abundant production, the best of
which are wines with engaging fruit
and charm, though not destined to be
long lived.

Beaujolais

Elegance, fruit and charm distinguish
the choicest of the Beaujolais wines,
whose producers experienced some of
the vinification problems encountered
in so many great years (viz. 1947,
1959). The cuvées we selected rep-
resent the very best to be had in the
region.

Pouilly Fume,
Pouilly-sur-Loire

Smaller production per acre due to
“natural selection’ resulted in ex-
tremely good wines, among the most
successful in France in 1964. Similar
to the great 1959s, with tremendous
style.

‘\e. 4 ‘ :

This advance offering of the 1964
wines, both the exceptional estate-
bottlings and our own selection of
fine Burgundy varietals, presents the
knowledgeable wine buyer with an
unusual opportunity to stock his cellar
at most advantageous prices.

Because of our long and close rela-
tionship with our Burgundian vint-
ners, we have been able to make an
early acquisition of a varied selection
at prices that are extremely attractive
and well below what the 1964 vintage
will command later.

A word about
Bordeaux

A generally excellent and abundant
crop seems to have been harvested in
1964 but since the large chateaux do
not assemble all their barrels into a
single wine until January, tasting at
this point is not definitive. Thus, we
prefer not to offer these wines now,
but to wait until we can accurately
determine how the assemblages have
turned out.
