BURGUNDY

The surest method of obtaining au-
thentic red and white Burgundy is to
buy only wines mise du domaine,
estate-bottled by the growers them-
selves. No shipper’s blend can match
the personality of wine thus bottled.
For estate-bottling (as exemplified
here) preserves the character of the
cri, or vineyard from which it
originated.

Prince de Merode

Noble indeed are the wines vinified
by the cousin of the Belgians’ King
Baudouin. His large holdings on the
hill of Corton (which contains more
premier cri vineyards than any other
spot in Burgundy) regularly pro-
duces faultless wines of regal char-
acter. The Prince is envied not only
because he owns some of the best land
in Burgundy (now selling at $40,000
per acre), but for the prized cherry-
like bouquet of his wines.

SSS

Mongeara-
Mugneret

A real Burgundian is Jean Mongeard
—hearty and hardworking. At fifteen,
he was already a vintner in his own
right. Every year or two he offers us
new appellations, some of the greatest
in all Burgundy. We've waited years
to obtain even a few cases of his Clos-
Vougeot (1964 is a favorite of
M. Mongeard), while his excellent
Pinot Noir is always much in de-
mand with restaurants and clients in
Vosne-Romanée.

René Roy

All but unknown in America (but
much appreciated in France )are the
very palatable reds and whites from
the village of Auxey-Duresses. Here
in his vineyards, hidden behind the
more famous slopes of Volnay and
Pommard, René Roy produces some
of the finest wines of the area, though
he is now well past 70. His Volnay-
Santenots ranks among the best
Burgundy offers.

Henri Gouges
In a region where a man’s property
is measured row by row, M. Gouges
is a rara avis: he owns 23 acres of
vines in Nuits-St. Georges, all premier
cra. Connoisseurs prize his wines—
like Les Pruliers—for their unique and
delicious gout de terroir (“taste of
soil”). His Les St. Georges is the best
of this very famous name. To acquire
such a wine from such a respected
producer is indeed a caup! Gouges
compares 1964 to the elegant 1923s,
which he remembers fondly.

Gouges Freres

Michel and Marcel (seen |. and r. in
photo), sons of Henri Gouges, prac-
tice the same impeccable wine making
techniques employed by their illus-
trious father. Indeed, they assist him
in his vineyards. They take justifiable
pride in their own Nuits-St. Georges
holdings, from which we have chosen
this remarkable example.

Jacques Parent

The rich red Burgundies M. Parent
bottles himself are the best of his
cellars and are usually reserved for
the two and three star restaurants of
Paris. We feel fortunate to have ob-
tained two very remarkable estate-
bottled reds from the Parent domaine
—wines that he describes as having

“great fruit and suppleness.”

‘ Marquis
d’ Angerville

It takes years for most Burgundian
growers to assemble a few precious
rows of vines which, in all probability,
will be scattered amongst several
communes. The property of the
Marquis, to the contrary, was ac-
quired at one time (by a great-great
grandfather), and has remained in-
tact for 150 years—all 35 acres of it!
The Marquis, just 36, participates in
all aspects of the vintage, exercising
the most rigorous standards. The re-
sultant estate-bottled Volnays, as
splendid as too many “restaurant
Volnays” are mediocre, have a deli-
cacy and lightness of color quite uni-
que amongst Burgundies.
