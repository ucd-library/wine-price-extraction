ere is the most original and

useful Bourbon decanter
devised since Repeal. Long after the exceptional Bourbon
which it contains has been consumed, the decanter remains
to perform its function as a simple, effective cocktail shaker.
[ts ingenuity and attractiveness is amply testified to by the
fact that it recently won the Fashion Academy Gold Medal

award for outstanding design.

It will be doubly appreciated as a gift because it contains
a Bourbon that is universally acknowledged as one of
Kentucky’s finest Bonded Beam 6 year old. Since the
Beam Distillery informs us that these decanters were pro-
duced in a quantity that represents only a fraction of the

demand, we suggest that you order early.
