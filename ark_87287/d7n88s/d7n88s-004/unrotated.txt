“Le Can-Can”’ captures the free, spirited expres-
sion of the art of Toulouse-Lautrec with te-
markable fidelity. Your selections of wines and
spirits will become a unique, exciting gift when

sent in the sturdy metal “Le Can-Can”’.

In addition to its endless decorative possibili-
ties, its functional uses are many a waste
basket, laundry hamper, plant holder, storage
for books, papers, toys, fire logs; and, being
water tight, it becomes the most delightful of
all ice buckets. Certainly, an ideal gift of wines
and spirits to send your friends this Christmas

or for other occasions.
