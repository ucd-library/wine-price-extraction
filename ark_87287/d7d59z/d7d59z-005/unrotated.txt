given by the State Department. If a Lafite Roth-
schild is to be born in Napa Valley, we suspect it
will take place at the Mondavi Winery. The winery
is a work of beauty well worth visiting - the dedi-
cation of Robert Monadvi and his sons and daughter
J to making the best wines of the valley, is a delight
to behold. Their friendliness as hosts make them well worth visiting.
