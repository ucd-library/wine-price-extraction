THE VINEYARDS OF NAPA, SONOMA, AND MENDOCINO VALLEYS

Our associates, Sam and Michael Aaron, spent the second half of January joyously exploring the great
vineyards of Napa, Sonoma and Mendocino Valleys. They were delighted with many of their wine
discoveries - some of the more exalted California wines achieving a rank of great distinction. However,
like all good things in life, these truly great wines are produced in limited quantity - few reach New
York. When they do, the quantity is so small that they must be rationed. Don't let this discourage you.

We are limiting this report to Napa, Sonoma and Mendocino - the areas we have just visited. We will

report on our coming visits to the vineyards south and east of San Francisco in a later brochure.

THE NAPA VALLEY

We quote from the newly-issued book, THE CALIFORNIA WINE BOOK, by Bob
Thompson and Hugh Johnson, "The Napa Valley is the place in California, the
keeper of the flame, the pinnacle." Now let us proceed on a tour together of the
better vineyards of the Napa Valley.
