482 VOSNE=ROMANEE 1971, Moillard 8.99 105.50 715
Burgundians consider the commune wines of Vosne-Romanee the best
and most reliable of the village wines. Here we are dealing with
blends from the excellent vineyards that lie within the geographic
boundaries of Vosne-Romanee. Moillard, an acknowledged dean
among the wine merchants, exhibits his wine-making skill beautifully 577
in this 1971.
178 VOSNE-ROMANEE, LES BEAUMONTS 1972, G. Noellat 9.49 108.00
Vosne-Romanee is undoubtedly the most prestigious wine -producing i 670
commune of all France. In its boundaries you can find Romanee-
Conti, Richebourg, La Tache, and the outstanding Les Beaumonts
vineyard, All of these have common characteristics: amazing breed
and elegance, wonderful harmony, dramatic bouquet, and true nobility. 7
Also available in_half-bottles at $4.89 each, $111.00 the case.
444 CHAMBERTIN CLOS DE BEZE 1972, B. Grivelet 9.95 45)
[2 ear 5 een Chamberrin Clos de Beze is on the same
CHAMBERTIN CLOS DE BEZE exalted level as Chambertin - it is
ee entitled to drop the 'Clos de Beze', if it NG
RECOLT a so chooses. It achieves the highest peak
1972 | of great red Burgundy - powerful, long-
| | lived, with great depth and breed. The
| © seccursnen sso scraaatio | favorite of Napoleon, it was Dumas who 733
J tenes rrosricios __| said of it, "nothing makes the future look
so rosy as to contemplate it through a glass of Chambertin."
49] MUSIGNY 1972, Hudelot 14.65 170.45
We quote Frank Schoonmaker's Encyclopedia, "Musigny is unsurpassed
by any other red wine of the Cote d'Or or indeed of the world." About
1600 cases are produced a year and the world clamors for them. Only
a few cases of the 1972 remain.
523 MUSIGNY 1971, Comte de Vogue 35.79 386 .53
There are those wine authorities who claim Musigny is the greatest of
the Burgundian vineyards, Comte de Vogue is the best producer on
the Cote d'Or, and 1971 is the best red Burgundy vintage year since oy
1961. If this be so - and we are not inclined to argue here - we are
dealing with the greatest single gem available in Burgundy today.
It will continue to grow in greatness and stature with the passage
of years. Only ten cases - and then no more.

CUVEE LATOUR BLANC 1973, Louis Latour 4.79
Here we must pause. This superb, rich, full white Burgundy can match

the best Meursault you have ever tasted. It is possicly the best vaiue

in outstanding white Burgundy offered in a decade. It is not a simple

Pinot Chardonnay, Macon Blanc or Bourgogne Blanc, but it is produced

from the soil of the Cote de Beaune. It is Cuvee Latour 1973 proudly
produced by Louis Latour himself. He thinks enough of it to emblazon

his name on the label. In blind tastings it is the match of many white
Burgundies that we and many others are offering for over $8 the bottle.

Only a few cases remain. Next shipment arrives early April. Anticipate
your spring and summer requirements now!
POUILLY FUISSE 1975, Georges Burrier 4.99

Burrier. It was my first contact with an
outstanding estate-bottled Pouilly Fuisse

which is often head and shoulders above

the run-of-the-mill, commercial examples

that are encountered in every large city of

the western world. Here is Pouilly Fuisse.
