1959 Burgundies, perhaps the best and most enjoyable of our
lifetime, reached our cellars during last Autumn, bringing
their glory to you—and every one is now on sale!

Here is an opportunity that the wine-lover should not over-
look. Practically no 1959 estate-bottled Burgundy worth ac-
quiring remains in the cellars of the growers. Those that are
still commercially available in Burgundy today command
double the price of our low acquisition cost of a few years ago.

Our advice is to anticipate your needs far ahead, because
the next outstanding year, 1961, which will reach us two years,
hence, will be much more costly than these 1959s, and they
certainly will not be superior. You will discover that even the
lesser Bungundies of 1959 are excellent and the best are
frankly great—an incomparable year, rich in fruit, well-
balanced, ready to be enjoyed immediately and with the further
happy prospect of improvement as they remain in the cellar.
Each wine offered here has been tasted carefully at the vine-
yards and represents the best of Burgundy.

SALE PRICE
No. Bottle Case
261 BEAUJOLAIS LAMARTINE 1.59 17.95

It is fitting indeed that this superb Beaujolais should bear the name ot
the outstanding French poet and statesman, Alfonse Lamartine. He
was born in the Beaujolais country, loved it, and the main street of the
town of Macon bears his name. No ordinary Beaujolais this, but rich
in fruit, to be consumed enthusiastically, and eminently satisfactory
for everyday drinking. A real bargain because surely this would be
good value at $2.

215 SAVIGNY LES BEAUNE,
DOMINAUDES 2.19 24.50
Estate bottled, Briaille
This is unlike any Savigny-les-Beaune that we have ever run across. It
tastes like an extremely sturdy, well-balanced Beaune of a great vine-
yard.

126 MERCUREY 2.9 24.50

Estate bottled, Baron Thenard
A red wine of finesse and distinction, delightful when young, and
estate bottled by Baron Thenard. Normally 2.49.

‘246 CHATEAU DE MONTHELIE 2.49 27.95
Estate bottled, Suremain

Just south of Volnay and up a dirt road is the tiny village of Monthelie.
Less known than Volnay, they sometimes achieve the stature of the
good Volnays but cost considerably less. Normally 2.79

231 BOURGOGNE ROUGE 2.49 27.95
Estate bottled, General Gouachon

No one could have been more surprised than General Gouachon to
find that his Clos des Corvees vineyard, one of the best of Nuits, has
produced more than the legal maximum in 1959. This was a result
of nature’s bounty, not the General’s wishes. Under the strict French
control, the over-production, the lighter Cuvees, cannot carry the
name of Nuits St. Georges, which is its true origin, but must be sold
as Bourgogne Rouge. This provides a real bargain and bonus to the
wine drinker who is more interested in what is in the bottle than what
appears on the label,

Great 1959

275 FIXIN, CLOS DU CHAPITRE 249 31.50
Estate bottled, Pierre Gelin

A sleeper—though the name is not generally familiar to the wine

lover, a good Fixin can often achieve the stature of its neighboring

vineyard, Chambertin. If you can survive without having a great name

on the label but want good wine, by all means buy this one.

*190 CHAPELLE CHAMBERTIN 2.99 34.50
Estate bottled, Clair-Dau
Only a narrow road separates Chapelle-Chambertin from the directly
adjoining Clos de Beze, and when well made, Chapelle-Chambertin is
a true artistocrat, with enormous power and breed.

398 BEAUNE GREVES 3.29 36.25
Estate bottled, Duvault-Blochet

The better vineyards of Beaune are characterized by softness and

lightness, noted for finesse and aroma, and are relatively quick to

mature. Here is perhaps the best single vineyard of this famed wine-

producing town and is a true glory in 1959.

3.29 36.50
Estate bottled, Marquis d’Angerville
The Marquis d’Angerville who makes his wines the way the Burgun-
dians did it before the war undoubtedly is the best producer in Volnay.
Some say his “Champans” vineyard provided him with his bestin 1959
In any event, here is a classic wine, of beautiful harmony, that will
be outstanding for many years to come
*202 POMMARD “CLOS BLANC” 3.49 39.50
Estate bottled, F. Clerget
[he most popular of the Burgundies is certainly “Pommard,” perhaps
because its name is so easy to remember. Most of the commercial ones
that reach the United States lack distinction. An authentic one 1s hard
to come by. This is an absolute beauty from a superb vineyard, made
by a skilled grower. Normally 3.99

279 ALOXE CORTON 3.49 39.75
Estate bottled, M. Quenot

The best wines of the Cote de Beaune come from around the little
town of Aloxe. Here is a splendid, well balanced example.

*484 ECHEZEAUX 3.69 42.50

Estate bottled, R. Engel

An interesting combination of body and strength that will improve

considerably with age. Great class at low cost. Normally 3.99.

*269 POMMARD, LES EPENOTS 3.69 42.50

Estate bottled, Domaine Parent

If one were seeking the best vineyard, the Montrachet of Pommard, he
would find it at “Les Epenots” It is the kind of wine because of finesse,
bouquet and world demand that should obtain $5.00. A real bargain

for the wine lover
226 GEVREY CHAMBERTIN,
CLOS ST. JACQUES 3.69 42.50
Estate bottled, Clair-Dau
M. Clair-Dau whose cellars are just opposite that wonderful country
restaurant, “Les Gourmets” where the vignerons eat, is a proud vine-
yard owner and controls some of the best properties in Burgundy, in-
variably winning one of the Gold Medals at the great agricultural
exposition. M. Clair-Dau tells us that this is his favorite and we think
you will be enamored by its vigor and Chambertin-like strength.
