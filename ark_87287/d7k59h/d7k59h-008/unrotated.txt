ART & WINE

At Chateau Lascombes

Some of you may recall our catalog of last winter with its
colorful Van Gogh cover, an introduction by Clifton Fadiman,
and an article by Dr. Alfred Frankfurter. These two eminent
critics developed the thesis that there is a link between art and
wine. And now another event that symbolizes this relationship,
takes place in the little wine town of Margaux, in the Bordeaux
district, right in the midst of the vineyards. For, at Chateau
Lascombes, whose wines are appreciated throughout the world,
there is an important art exhibit on the subject of “Wine and the
Vine”. This intriguing concept was developed by Alexis Lichine
and has won the plaudits of the art critics of France. Not only is
Alexis Lichine the Managing Director of Chateau Lascombes,
and an internationally famous wine authority, but evidently is a

most persuasive individual. It was not an easy task to be able to
gather, all under one roof at the Chateau, the excellent works of

sixty recognized French, and thirty outstanding Italian artists.
All of the 250 paintings on exhibit are related to the theme of
wine.

Some of you may be in France this summer and would gladly
detour off the main road to experience a restaurant that has
earned three stars in the Guide Michelin. And we genuinely be-
lieve that visiting Chateau Lascombes and its gallery is equally
worth a major detour.

You will be greeted warmly and made welcome by Alexis
Lichine and his staff. They will proudly tell you all about the
vineyards of the Medoc, the process of wine-making there, and
enthusiastically join you, while you taste and appraise the more
recent vintages. The exhibit will be on continuous display, until
the last grapes of the autumn vintage are gathered—-and you
will be made welcome .every day, including Sundays, ‘until the
hour of 7 P.M.

Great wines in Magnums! Will
add lustre to any cellar, particu

larly at these very low prices.
