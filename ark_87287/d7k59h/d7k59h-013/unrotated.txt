lingering bouquet and rich, tull character. In the mastertul hands ot

282 VOSNE ROMANEE LES
MALCONSORTS 3.99
Estate hottled, EB. Moillard

In 1956, on a vineyard tour, we never stopped long enough in any one
town to have our laundry done. The-situation became desperate but
Madame Moillard came to our rescue and arranged that it be done in
her home in one day. We often feel sentimental about her but we don’t
don't think we depart from objectivity when we state that this classic
wine from some of the best soil in Burgundy reached incomparable
heights in 1959.

271 CLOS DE TART 3.99

In the 7th Century, a nunnery was founded in the town of Morey, not

Cote d'Or:

Estate bottled, L’Heretier-Guyot

The wines of Clos de Vougeot vary greatly from one producer’s cellat

to another, those coming from along the Route National being far

less good than those produced in the upper part of the hillside adjoin-

ing Musigny, Grands Echezeaux, etc. This particular wine comes from

one of the best portions of the Clos. A splendid 1959.

804 CHARMES CHAMBERTIN 4.79 51.50

Estate bottled, General Rebourseau
Deep, rich, with all of the balance and fullness associated with the

213 CHAMBERTIN, CLOS DE BEZE 5.49 59.995
Estate bottled, Pierre Damoy

The largest and best producer of Clos de Beze is Pierre Damoy. This

vineyard is the equal of “Le Chambertin”, and has the same character-

istics. A big majestic unity. Normally 5.99.

The Best of the 1960

250 cases is the total production of all white
Burgundies by J. Monnot, but the wine he
puts in the bottle is unsurpassed and possibly
unequalled among the white wine producers
of France. Wines that carry his labels are
treasures indeed, with an extraordinary
wealth of flavor and bouquet, powerful and
entirely remarkable:

  

His 1960s are typical, with great freshness
and charm, coupled with pronounced bou-
quet and distinction. Each of these five wines
is outstanding and is priced well below the
qualities they exhibit.

$23 PINOT CHARDONNAY
LAMARTINE 1.59 17.95

It is the Pinot Chardonnay grape of noble heritage, that produces the
vreat wines such as Montrachet, Meursault and Corton Charlemagne
This wine, offered at such modest cost, is produced entirely in the
Burgundy district from Pinot Chardonnay vines. Here, at last, is an
opportunity to drink white Burgundy of finesse, of outstanding vintage,
and at astonishingly low cost. Here again, is an extra bonus, to the
wine drinker who is more interested in what happens when the cork
is drawn than what appears on the label.

344 POUILLY VINZELLES 1.69 18.50

Estate bottled, Caves des Grand Cru

The farmers of this important wine town in the Pouilly district bring
their wine to the local cooperative where it is estate bottled. The re-
sult is a wine made of the noble Pinot Chardonnay grape, of an excel-
lent vintage year and at a price that is not just good, but astonishing!
We have no other white wine of this class and breed that can be
acquired at this price—hardly more than what one would pay for an
ordinary, undistinguished regional.

26.50

Estate bottled, Domaine Bavard
The greatest dry wines of France are produced in this township
Though this wine does not owe its heritage to one of the great vine-
yards, nevertheless it participates in the magnificence of its geography,
and of a great vintage year. Amazingly fine wine for a price as low as
this.

329 POUILLY FUISSE,

BOUTHIERES A12

Estate bottled, M. Dondin

Here is the best single Pouilly Fuisse we have ever tasted. Produced
during the great 1959 vintage by M. Dondin, it surpasses in distinction
many white Burgundies that command much higher prices. Green-
gold in color, with great finesse, here is a white wine of outstanding
class—a sensational value for those seeking superb dry white wine at
modest cost.

harmonious. Recommended unreservedly

658 PULIGNY MONTRACHET,

PUCELLES 3.69 42.50

Candidly, an incredible wine! We prefer this to practically any Mon
trachet we have tasted and which may command double the price. De-
signed to gladden the heart of the lover of good white Burgundy.
