Wine lovers everywhere are eagerly awaiting the

petter 1961 Beaujolais and Pouilly Fuisse- This importa :

is now taking place—t yb red wines from Beaujolais, Moulin-A-
Vent and Fleurie are in—an ere is also a classic 1961 Pouilly Fuisse |
__and one of the best Pp! as we pave EV" tasted—the Beaujolais
Rose 1961.

Each of these wines W Alexis Lichine, who states, “Some
of the best Beaujolais JT ha or tasted in my lifetime was pr
during 1961—the wines are typical, rmer than the 1959, longer
with a classic vigor that will delight the wine lover.”

The production during this great vintage year was small, the better
wines are hard to come by, and the prices at the vineyard are record-
breaking. Nevertheless, by quantity purchasing, we have managed to
keep the prices down at a modest level. You will find all four of these
sae delightful for day-in, day-out drinking during the summer days
ahead.
