DOUGLAS “BOARD MEMBERS CHOICE”...

EXCITING NEWS FOR SCOTCH DRINKERS! You can maintain a high quality level in your Holiday entertaining
by serving one of Scotland’s most distinguished whiskies and yet pay the unbelievably low sale price of $4.69. It is
not a product of an obscure distillery, but was carefully blended, aged and bottled in Scotland by the 178 Year Old
firm of Alexander Sommervail. Candidly, whisky of this age and calibre would be good value at $6.00 or more—at this
low sale price, it is a Scotch opportunity not to be ignored.

GLEN ALAN (Imported by S. S. Pierce Co.) .

No ordinary Scotch this! A fully matured whisky from one of Scotland’s finest distilleries and imported by S. S.

Since the boyhood days of Robert Burns, when the distinguished company of Whigham, Ferguson &
Cunningham built their first cellars flanking the River Ayr, quality has been their constant goal.

ence ‘of bottling and blending for discriminating drinkers throughout the world. Only 300 cases
released for the United States.

FORTNUM & MASON’S RED SEAL

5.99 68.50

Only last year Fortnum & Mason celebrated their 250th anniversary—a store that has dominated
fashion and taste in London through the centuries. The distinguished Scotch whisky that bears their
name reflects this leadership. Exceptionally well balanced, rich in flavour, it is undoubtedly the best
value in fine Scotch whisky that prevails anywhere in the New York area.
