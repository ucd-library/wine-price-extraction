Century old

Cellars

The color picture which you see on the
cover was not photographed in the an-
cient vaults of some Chateau in France,
but right here in New York—in the cool
underground cellars of Sherry’s that, be-
lieve it or not, have been in existence for
over a century and only recently redis-
covered by our associate, Jack Aaron. ‘

 

 
 
 
 

anoove®® The cellars, medieval in character, with
Uy handsome stone vaulted arches and cob-
blestone floors, are the equal of the best
we have seen in Europe—because of the
45 foot depth below the earth and the
even temperature that is maintained
throughout the year. The cover photo-
graph can only capture a small section of
these vast cellars, built before the Civil
War by a brewery.
The wines and spirits that are being of-
fered in this “Fall Sale” are presently rest-
ing in these cellars, ready to offer their
delightful qualities to add joy to your
Autumn and Holiday living.

THOUSANDS, not only in Manhattan, a
but everywhere in New York State, look
to Sherry’s for the very best in fine wines
and spirits and at the lowest possible
prices. Though there have been substan- ’
tial cost increases at the vineyards and dis-
tilleries, we have rolled back the prices
of many items to reflect our original cost
and not what the present market should
dictate —a few of our “Best Buys” are
listed here—many more can be found in
