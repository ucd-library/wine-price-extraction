In 1957, Her Majesty, Queen Elizabeth II visited Portugal
and to commemorate the event, the entire contents of the cask
which held the 1792 Solera was bottled, interrupting a 160
year slumber. We were fortunate in acquiring some of these
precious bottles and were amazed by its extraordinary
qualities — its full vigor, penetrating bouquet and great
depth of flavor. Being relatively dry, it rivals fine old Cognac
in scope and interest.

Here is a true collector’s item, that soon will be gone—even
a single bottle will add ‘ts touch of lustre to the most dis-

One of the great
discoveries of my last year’s trip to Eu-
rope was the Pear Brandy of Switzerland.
| fell in love with the clean, fruity flavor
also intrigued by the fact that a giant
pear sits quietly in the center of the bot-
tle. adding its eye appeal to the fabulous
pear flavor. Incidentally, this feat 1s ac-
complished by putting a bottle around the
pear bud in the Spring. the pear keeps
erowing and growing, until it almost fills
the bottle — the pear brandy is added,
preserving the pear practically forever
into the future. The entire crop yielded
only 218 bottles of this unique Pear
Brandy and J strongly suggest that you
reserve some for the most astonishing of
Christmas gifts, or for your own holiday
pleasure—$14.95—due Dec. 15th.
