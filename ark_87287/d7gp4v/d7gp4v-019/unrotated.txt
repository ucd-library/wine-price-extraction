1297 SINGLE CASK UNBLENDED
COGNAC (1929 Vintage). . . - 9.45 108.00
Here is an Estate-bottled Cognac that was produced during a great vintage year (1929) in the most celebrated \

I BRR

part of the Cognac country, “Grand Fine Champagne”. It has remained in its unblended state in barrels from 1929
until the present date. Cognac of this calibre is difficult to obtain because no more than a few small growers have
the patience and aptitude to put aside, year after year, a distillation of their outstanding vintages.
