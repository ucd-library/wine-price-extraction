We have searched long and hard
for a pleasing red and white
wine to sell under $1.00 the bot-
tle. We know of no more pleas-

2 ing examples available than the
red and white Bordeaux of Boyer
Freres.

RED WINES

164 BORDEAUX ROUGE 1955, Boyer Freres

No ordinary regional wine this! Here is an authentic 1955
from Bordeaux’s most important firm. Worth much more.

368 CHIANTI, Cimamori (Quart Wicker )

A pleasant red table wine from Tuscany—in the traditional,
colorful, wicker bottle at a cost of only 3¢ the fluid ounce.

WHITE WINE

967 BORDEAUX BLANC 1959, Boyer Freres

A distinguished counterpart to the Bordeaux Rouge de-
scribed above — medium dry, pleasant and full of fruit.
From an impeccable shipper.

PINK WINE

450 ROSE DE CARAFE 1957,

A charming pink wine grown not far from Bordeaux. It is

the kind of Carafe Rose you will be enjoying with your
lunch at the better inns of southwest France.

Delightful wines of France at
temptingly low sale prices. We
suggest a mixed case for ONLY
$14.50.

RED WINES

487 COTES DU RHONE ROUGE 1955

Here is a beautifully balanced, sound, moderately priced
wine that can be drunk everyday with great enthusiasm.

911 BEAUJOLAIS 1957, Montmelas

A pleasing, young example of France’s most popular red
wine.

WHITE WINES

397 ALSATIAN SYLVANER 1959, Hanhart

A soft, distinguished, relatively light white wine from the
cellars of Hanhart.

984 CHATEAU FAYAU 1955 (Cadillac)

From the land that lies between two Bordeaux rivers of
Garonne and the Dordogne, comes some of the most full-
flavored, medium dry and delightful white wine of the
world. Here is one that carries the kind of richness and
fruitiness usually associated with Sauternes. An astonish-
ing value.

Don’t let the low price of $1.19
deceive you — fine thorough-
breds can be found in this group.
You can make up your own as-
sortment of any twelve bottles in
this group and enjoy the case
price.

RED WINES

179 MEDOC 1955, Boyer Freres

This Medoc was finally chosen after careful comparison
among 15 candidates—An authentic, graceful 1955 claret.
Ideally suited for drinking, day in and day out.

191 PUISSEGUIN ST. EMILION 1955

Well balanced, soft 1955 St. Emilion.

441 SPANISH RIOJA RED 1955

Good Spanish red wine is not easy to come by. This vigor-
ous red, an astonishing discovery of Frank Schoonmaker,
is entirely remarkable, deserves to sell for almost double
the price, and easily competes with the better Clarets of
the same year.

WHITE WINES

976 GRAVES 1955, Boyer Freres

A pleasing, relatively dry example of fine white Bordeaux.

442 SPANISH RIOJA WHITE 1955

Discovered in northern Spain—a beautiful, well balanced
dry white wine with exceptional character.
