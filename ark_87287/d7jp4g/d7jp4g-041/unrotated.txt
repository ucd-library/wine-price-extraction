THE WINES OF AUSTRIA

Some of the vineyards are so close to Vienna that they
say, given enough sun, the vines would entwine the
Opera House. The spritely taste of these dry white wines
reflect the gaiety, subtlety and zest of beloved Vienna.
Although overshadowed by the vineyards of Germany,
the good Austrian wines do deserve recognition and
appreciation in light of their excellence and modest price.
If you want to conduct an interesting wine experiment,
or send a case as an intriguing gift to a friend, we suggest
you ask for the AUSTRIAN SAMPLER-it consists of 12
bottles, two each of the wines listed below. The cost to
you will be only $25—a saving of $3.08 compared to
single bottle prices.

to drink. Light, dry, pleasing. Estate-bottled, Dr. Ernst
Weigl.

dry white wine classic.

NUSSBERGER SPATLESE 1966..... 2.49 26.90
Estate-bottled, The Abbey of Schotten—a vineyard estab-
lished in 1158 and the Viennese can walk there as readily
as we can to Central Park.

GRINZINGER AUSLESE 1966....... 2.49 26.90

escape from their country.

Probably the best single dry white wine of all Austria.

The Argentine is the largest wine-producing and wine-
consuming country of the western hemisphere. The per
capita consumption is over 75 bottles! In America, it is
about eight bottles. No great wines are produced, but

In the ancient civilization of Greece, wine played an im-
portant role. You need merely look at Greek art and
Greek literature to confirm the statement. We all know
the Greek God of wine, Dionysus. Some are flavored
with resin, which is an unfamiliar taste to the average
wine drinker. Many intrigue tourists, and they find the
delight they experienced in Greece hard to match when
they return. Here are the best of that country.
