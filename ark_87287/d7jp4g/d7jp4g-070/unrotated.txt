Let us examine the facts.

The size of the great vineyards of Bordeaux are fixed by
nature and law, and yet they must contend with an ever-
increasing world demand, stimulated by world travel,
added affluence, more leisure, and increased populari-
zation via books, magazines, radio and television. Proof
of this is that Chateau Lafite Rothschild 1959 has dra-
matically moved from $48 the case in 1960 to almost $300
the case today! We also know that 1968 was a relatively
dismal vintage in Bordeaux and the prices of the '66s and
'67s that remain on the Bordeaux market have gone up 10%
to 20% during the last few months.

An objective evaluation of the two vintage years, 1966
and 1967, in red Bordeaux was recently provided in the
new Time-Life book "Wines & Spirits"—here, we quote
directly from the book.

RED BORDEAUX

NOW?

1966—The Chateau owners were happy as they gathered this
great vintage; they were able to obtain the highest
prices for claret in Bordeaux wine history. A bit less
body than the '64s, but compensated for by unusual bou-
quet, better balance, and a remarkable similarity to the
extraordinary '53s, as well as sufficient tannin to pro-
vide the backbone for exceptional longevity. Recon-
mended for laying down in private wine cellars.

1967—The crop was most beneficial to the wine drinker
because it was exceptionally large, above average in
quality, and produced a soft, quick-maturing, fruity
wine with a fine bouquet. This most useful, satisfying
vintage can be consumed joyously while we wait for the
slower maturing '6ls and '66s to come to their full
frRudeion.

Favored vineyard owned by Marcel Dassault, famed creator of the
Mirage-Mystere, and Falcon Jet. Our tasting notes read,
"astonishing—big, fat, outstanding St. Emilion—obviously good

for another decade".
CHATEAU LATOUR CARNET (Medoc)

Ranked in the 1855 classification on the same level as Beychevelle
Talbot, and Duhart-Milon. Since its small size did not permit

world-publicity, it is therefore a "best buy'.
