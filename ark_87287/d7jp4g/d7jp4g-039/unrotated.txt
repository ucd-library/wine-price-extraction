THE WINES OF SPAIN

There is more vineyard land in Spain than in any other

country in the world—less than 3% is Sherry. The best
table wines are from Rioja and some good ones are pro-
duced in Valdepenas—also spottily in a few other prov-
inces. Look for the old vintage wines of Rioja which are
among the best values in outstanding red wine extant
today.

Bottle Case
BANDA AZUL 19640. ee. ick. 1.49 16.10

nina from where this wine comes. Look for earthy lusti-
ness, honesty and depth of flavor. A ‘best buy.’
SANT-GRIA 1.59 17.17
The drink of Spain is now beginning to sweep America—
a happy mixture of red wine, fruit and sugar. Pour it in
a pitcher with ice cubes, cut fruit and you have an in-
stant delightful punch.

GRAN RESERVA 1947.............. 5.99 64.70

case in Bordeaux. Note how low, relatively, this Pater-
nina classic is. Frank Schoonmaker considers it the best
red wine of all Spain.
