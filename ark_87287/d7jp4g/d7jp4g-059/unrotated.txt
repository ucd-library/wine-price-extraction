THE VERY BEST OF SWITZERLAND

Skiers, tourists, businessmen go to Switzerland each year. While there, they develop a strong affec-
tion for the wines. When attempting to duplicate the experience in America, they report that the
Swiss wines they taste here are not quite the same.

Mr. Michael Dreyfus, a world authority on wines, born in Switzerland, decided to do something
about this. His mission was to bring back only the best white and red wines from the mountain
vineyards of his beloved home land. After many trips, long searching, and continuous comparative
tasting, Mr. Dreyfus reports that he has finally succeeded. He is convinced that not even the presi-
dent of a ‘Swiss wine society’ could do better in selecting the choicest that his country has to offer.

If you are interested in tasting what Mr. Dreyfus has brought back and the best that Switzerland
has to offer, here they are in all their excellence:
