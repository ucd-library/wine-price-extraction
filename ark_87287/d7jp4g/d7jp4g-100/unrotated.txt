Scotland produces over 3,000 brands of whisky and practically all of them are blends consisting of
rich, flavorsome malts and light grain whisky. Seeking out the twelve year old “The Glenlivet” High-
land Malt presents the same kind of challenge to the Scotch drinker that discovering a beautifully
balanced fine old Cognac is to the brandy fancier. “Smith's” is distilled from a pure barley malt in
great copper pot stills and then left to mature untouched for twelve long years.

The countryside is part of the heritage of “The Glenlivet” distillery, the first legally recognized
Scotch-maker in Scotland. Genuine Glenlivet can only be produced in the district of Glenlivet, amidst
colorful fields that grow the choicest barley. Equally close are the peat fields of Faemussach whose
rich flavor is imparted to the ultimate whisky. The springs that tumble 1,200 feet above the glen add
their pure aerated merriment. The site of the distillery has remained unchanged for over a century.
History reports the romance and the ultimate nobility of the product that has resulted.

Originally, this superb single whisky of Scotland was called ‘uisgebeatha’ or ‘water of life’. Most
Scotch whiskies which pretend to quality covet ‘The Glenlivet” in their blends. Only the best blenders
pay the high prices that the Smith’s Distillery demands. Their famous malt whisky is rather like the
yeast in a cake—“‘the little bit that keeps the rest alive’. When you drink this whisky straight, you are
dealing almost with an essence—the best that Scotland has to offer—after twel
untouched and unblended in a single cask. It is not heavy, as many bel
Serve it in a Cognac snifter and it will easily pass the test.

We urge that you acquire at least a limited supply, while available, eith
