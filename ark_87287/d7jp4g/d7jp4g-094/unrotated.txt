This excellent light red wine is not Chateau-bottled. It is a selection of
Baron Philippe de Rothschild and it proudly bears his name. This is the
last of the 1962 in America and in France. Get it while still available.

Many wine authorities believe that this vineyard is surpassed in St.

This 1962 La Lagune is now the rage of Bordeaux. It is the proud property
of Mr. Chayoux, who has done much in recent years to make it one of
the oustanding vineyards of the Medoc. Because of a relatively high
ratio of merlot grapes, it is one of the most mature of the 1962 Clarets.

A unique Claret. Much heavier, darker, and deeper in flavor than its
neighbors. A smaller version of either Chateau Mouton Rothschild or

Admirable balance and bouquet. Similar in character to the finer red
wines of the Graves district such as Pape Clement and Bouscaut.

 

We again quote from the Vintage Chart that appears in the
newly published book “Wines and Spirits”.

“1962—quietly, and with a minimum of publicity, the neglected
1962 Clarets have finally won deserved recognition among
the world’s wine-lovers. In their own way, they have some-
thing to offer us. Uniformly, they are excellent, early-matur-
ing, soft, fruity, a fine bouquet and can be enjoyed for present
drinking. Undoubtedly, the best Claret values available today.”

No. Bottle Case
449 CHATEAU MONTROSE (St. Estephe) 3.99 43.10

A great 2nd Growth, 1855 Medoc classification. A slow-to-mature wine
which reached height of quality in 1962. Similar in characteristics to
Chateau Latour. A favorite in England.

708 CHATEAU LEOVILLE LASCASES
fr quued) = 3.99 43.10

One of our favorite Clarets—particularly since 1959 when Dr. Peynaud,

head of the Wine Department of the University of Bordeaux, directed
the production.

103 CHATEAU LASCOMBES (Margaux) . 3.99 43.10
Alexis Lichine is proud of the wine that he produced here in 1962. The
world must have recognized this because it is among the most difficult
of all Clarets to obtain. Great finesse with a bouquet that is described
as ‘reminiscent of violets’.

420 CHATEAU COS D’ESTOURNEL
(eu Estepie) 2 4.29 46.35

Like Chateau Montrose above, this Estephe is hard and slow to develop

in a concentrated year such as 1961. However, in 1962, a superb balance
was achieved.

184 CHATEAU LA MISSION HAUT
BRIN (Graves) 2 6.19 66.85

This great Graves is in the ‘Grand Class’. It is no ordinary event to be
able to obtain such stature, breed and harmony for $6.19.

619 CHATEAU AUSONE (St. Emilion)... 7.99 86.30

We wanted you to taste a great First Growth from an outstanding year
below $10.00 per bottle. We, therefore, priced this excellent Ausone
down to a workable level. You will like it.

147 CHATEAU PETRUS (Pomerol) ...... 9.95 107.45

Achieves more pronounced velvetiness and fruit than any other Claret
whether produced in Medoc, Graves or St. Emilion. Because there are
only 16 acres in total, it is the most difficult of all of the 1st Growths to
obtain. A rarity. Truly magnificent,

202 CHATEAU MOUTON ROTHSCHILD

(Pama) 9.95 107.45
Small production—full-bodied—fleshy—rich. The biggest of all of the wines

of the Medoc—long-lasting and the proud property of the Baron Philippe
de Rothschild.

213 CHATEAU LATOUR (Pauillac) ..... 9.95 107.45

About 85% of Chateau Latour is planted with the Cabernet Sauvignon
grape. This partially accounts for its bigness, deep color, slow matura-
tion and long-life. Even its 1870 is still good today.

115 CHATEAU LAFITE ROTHSCHILD

ee) 9.95 107.45
In 1858, Baron James de Rothschild bought Lafite for five million francs.
It is a pride of the Rothschild family and the present Baron Eli spares no
expense in seeing that the quality, disinction and elegance of the Lafite
wines are maintained.

162 CHATEAU HAUT BRION (Graves) .. 9.95 107.45

Owned by the Clarence Dillon family, Chateau Haut Brion has achieved
a supreme position under the loving care of its director. Seymour Weller.
Great power combines with unique subtlety here.
