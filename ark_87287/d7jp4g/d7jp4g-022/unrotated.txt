After carefully perusing this wine list, James Beard commented, “I have
spent almost a half-century travelling throughout the world and collect-

ing wine lists from everywhere. I know of no other list in existence that
matches this one if judged by width of range, discriminating selection
and realistic prices. Whether the standard be day-in and day-out jug wine
wines for laying down, rarities from previous decades. the choicest xe
ples from the leading wine-growing areas of the world—all are included.
The wisdom of over three decades of tasting, learning, comparing, is re-
flected here. I extend my congratulations to Sam Aaron. Joseph Stricks

and Michael Aaron for the creative joy that they have brought to the wine
lovers of America.”
