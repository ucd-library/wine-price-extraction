ATWATER PRESS — | 1/68

FRONT COVER—
Harvesting in Champagne, the two-wheel wooden carts are traditional.

As 1968 ends, the alert consumer has pleasantly
discovered that the prices of his favorite spirits
have not followed the inflation graph, but are ac-
tually costing him less than they did three years
ago.

However, this is not true of the better table
wines of Europe and America. The reasons are
obvious—there is only just so much fine vineyard
soil, the cost of production goes up annually, and
the world-demand expands geometrically pro-
jected by jet travel, increased leisure, more
knowledgeable drinkers, and stimulated interest
in drinking, talking and learning about wine (one
does not talk about one’s ‘ice cream soda’ or
‘tomato juice’).

The economic implications are apparent. Now,
not next year, is the time to anticipate your wine
requirements before higher replacement costs
will be reflected by unavoidable escalation. This
problem has further been magnified by the gen-
erally disappointing quality of the 1968 vintage
throughout Germany, Burgundy, and Cham-
pagne. In Bordeaux, there have been a few mod-
erate successes but in general, 1968 can be
classified as a disappointing year even among
Clarets.

In the last analysis, it remains the merchant’s
responsibility—no, absolute moral commitment—
to taste critically the wines and spirits that he of-
fers and help guide his clientele to discover,
within each class, the best that can be obtained,
always in relation to taste, integrity, and price.
