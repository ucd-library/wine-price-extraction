CHAUVENET RED CAP

 

Sparkling Burgundy has
enjoyed great vogue in
the United States for
many decades. It has be-
come a traditional drink
in many households as
an accompaniment to the
Thanksgiving and Christ-
mas Dinner. The safest
course is to insist on
Chauvenet Red Cap—the
supreme example of a
red wine that has all of
the natural bubbly effer-
vescence of Champagne.

HINE COGNAC (5 Star and V.S.O.P.)

Somehow, on each of our
trips to the vineyards, we
managed to detour to the
Cognac area to visit our
good friends at HINE.

Both the Hine Five Star
and the V.S.O.P. reflect
the superior quality of the
aged Cognac that they
produce. We know of no
French brandies of more
dedicated heritage or
excellence.
