Because of relatively high tannin and great concentration
of all elements, the 1952 vintage in Burgundy has proven
particularly long-lived.

We all know how difficult it is to obtain outstanding and
authentic pre-war clarets from Bordeaux. The quest for
aged Burgundies is even more difficult—but the reward
for success becomes more satisfying. If you want to
experience how majestic an old red Burgundy can be,
choose among these—each has not only passed the test
of time, but the test of present excellence.

There is an up-to-date vintage chart in the book ‘How
To Eat Better For Less Money” which describes the
1969 vintage in white Burgundy as follows, “like the red
Burgundies, the whites have been produced in limited
quantity, are extremely expensive and are truly great.

Be on the lookout for them. They are long-lived.
