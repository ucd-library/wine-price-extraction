Sam Aaron has just returned from his visit to these deep, underground Burgundian cellars and reports “the quiet,
tomb-like darkness, the endless rows of ‘sleeping beauty’ bottles were covered thick with cobwebs—I shall never forget
the experience—the most rewarding and dramatic of my lifetime of wine tasting.”

WHO IS DR. ALBERT BAROLET? Research reveals
that he was a distinguished son of an old, respected Bur-
gundian family, who recently died at the age of 71. Dr.
Barolet was considered one of the most distinguished
physicians of the Burgundy area. At the time of his death
last year, he had already retired from his practice of
psychiatry, devoting full time to his beloved passion, col-
lecting the great wines of Burgundy. His name had be-
come legend among the wine lovers of the continent —
many would make annual pilgrimages to Beaune, tasting
his treasures, and bringing back choice bottles to add
lustre to their own wine collection.

In the Rubiayat of Omar Khayyam, the question is asked

No. Bottle Case
282 CHAMBOLLE MUSIGNY
9a? ee 11.50 125.00

Relatively light, but makes up in finesse what it lacks in body.
Beautiful bouquet, soft, delicate.

902 COTES DE NUITS
Vice. 192)... Cw. 1250 ~~ «155 6

Interesting ‘raspberry scent’. Not deep in flavor, but well balanced,

soft. A 47 year old wine that will become the conversation piece at
the holiday dinner table.

298 VOSNE-ROMANEE 1953 . 13.50 145.00

The most remarkable wine producing commune of all France. Fine,
with very rich overtones. Bouquet outstanding—flavorful.

929 CHAMBOLLE MUSIGNY
ea a

16.50 175.00

1952 is among the most long lived years in Burgundy, and this wine

proves it—just emerging. Beautiful color, not big, but beautifully
balanced.

   

“What can a vintner buy one half so precious as the stuff
he sells?”. Dr. Barolet found the answer—“more wine.”

THIS OCCASION MARKS THE FIRST TIME that Dr.
Barolet’s collection has crossed the Atlantic, their aged
virtues now becoming available to the wine lovers here.
Their authenticity, greatness and longevity have been
testified to by Dr. Barolet’s friends and wine clients in
such countries as France, Belgium and Switzerland—and
now America has an opportunity to render its verdict.

HERE IS A UNIQUE opportunity to bring the glory of
Burgundy to the holiday table, whether it be as a gift to
a friend, or for your own wine wonderment.

No. Bottle Case
917 CHARMES CHAMBERTIN
ioe 18.25 195.00

Vineyard only 31 acres, separated from Chambertin itself by only a
country lane. Heritage shows. Fragrant bouquet—big and full.

429 CHARMES CHAMBERTIN
oat. ue. 19.50 210.00

Very full and rich and blessed with great harmony. Undoubtedly
one of the best wines in Dr. Barolet’s cellar.

476 CLOS DE LA ROCHE 1921 23.50 250.00

Despite age, color is deep and lively. Amazingly similar to the Clos
de la Roche 1966 shown elsewhere in this brochure—rather like
comparing an attractive youth with his wise and mature grandfather.

471 CHAMBOLLE MUSIGNY,
LES AMOUREUSES, 1921. 24.65 265.00

This wine achieved top ratings at the tastings that took place in
Beaune, London, Geneva and New York. Very fruity and rich to the
palate, relatively light to the nose. Well balanced.
