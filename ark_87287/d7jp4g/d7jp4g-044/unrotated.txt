During the Yuletide, there is an
observable tendency on the
part of the Scotch drinker to
move away from his year-round
favorite and participate in the
Satisfying taste luxury of drink-
ing one of the older whiskies
of Scotland. This becomes par-
ticularly meaningful when a de-
cision is being made as to what
brand of Scotch should be sent
to an appreciative friend as a
gift.

When such a decision has to
be made, many of our clientele

DRY SACK

The word ‘Sack’ was a
favorite expression in
Elizabethean days. The
word ‘Dry’ is a favorite
expression today.

The combination of the
two gives you DRY SACK
—the Sherry that is an
acknowledged favorite in
Spain, England, and
America. Rich in flavor,
dry—but not too dry. Try
it ‘on-the-rocks’.
