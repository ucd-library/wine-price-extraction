The Rhone river starts in Switzerland and empties into
the Mediterranean. Red and white wines flourish along
its entire length. The important wine section is south of
Lyon and includes all of the world-famed names listed
below.

RED RHONE WINES

Bottle Case

COTES DU RHONE 1969........... 1.69 18.25
The charming, simple, honest red wine that you drink
in the country inns around Avignon. Vieille Ferme.

CROZES HERMITAGE 1969........ 1.99 21.50
The wonderful deep, rich red character of Hermitage at
half the price. Nicolas.

CHATEAUNEUF-DU-PAPE 1967..... 2.49 26.90
Estate-bottled, Domaine de Beaucastel. Impeccable
source. Sturdy, deep in color, full-bodied, excellent.

CHATEAUNEUF-DU-PAPE 1964..... 2.99 32.30
Estate-bottled, Domaine de Beaucastel. Here is the same
wine with three additional years of bottle age—hence
better rounded, more subtle.

HERMITAGE 3001... co Se 3.49 37.70
Produced on a very steep terraced hillside about 40 miles
south of Lyon. Referred to by Georges Saintsbury as
“the manliest of all wines.”

CHATEAUNEUF-DU-PAPE 1955..... 3.89 42.00
From the estate of the late Dr. Albert Barolet. One of
the most amazing examples of fine red Rhone wine we
have ever tasted.

COTE ROTIE 190... 3.5455: 3.99 43.10
We have just returned from this area and visited the
grower, Vidal-Fleury, who undoubtedly is the most im-
portant vigneron of this area. Vineyard located not far

from the Pyramide Restaurant at Vienne. Deep colored,
full-bodied, long-lived.

lasting of all dry white wines.

JURA MOUNTAINS (France)

The Jura Mountains lie midway between Burgundy and
Switzerland. The town of Arbois is the birthplace of
Louis Pasteur, where he conducted his famous experi-
ments and where some of the wines listed below are
grown. The most intriguing certainly is the Chateau
Chalon.

red wine grown in the Jura.

CHATEAU CHALON 1959.......... 8.95 96.65
To qualify for the name, the wine must remain in barrel
for six years, and must be bottled in special wide, flat
bottles, called clavelins. Unique, hard to come by.

We think of Portugal in terms of port wine, but in truth,
over 90% produced is table wine. Some of the world’s
best selling wines, such as Lancers and Mateus, come
from Portugal. The best white is Vinho Verde—and the
best red is Dao.
