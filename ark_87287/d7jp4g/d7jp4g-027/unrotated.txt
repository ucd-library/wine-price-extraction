It is no ordinary event to be able to offer the
legendary years among the great clarets that
read like history—1899, 1916, 1928, 1929, 1934
and 1937. Here are the great survivors of the
noble years that have evoked unstinted praise
in wine literature and at the dinner tables of
the proprietors of the great chateaux of
Bordeaux. Even the President of France, try-
ing to please his most honored guests, could
not offer greater aged wine classics than
those clarets that appear below.

RARE PRE-WAR CLARETS

These wines are no longer commercially available. Most
of them come from private cellars in France. To obtain
wines of this age and calibre is akin to seeking out a
Cezanne or Matisse. Here are wines to intrigue the col-
lector. All are from impeccable sources, and will provide
excellence when the cork is drawn.
