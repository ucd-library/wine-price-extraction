DENIS-MOUNIE
GOLD LEAF COGNAC

an Outstanding Cognac

at a dramatically
modest price

 

The Cognac fanciers of France
and England have long known
about the dry, well-balanced
qualities of the brandy pro-
duced by the venerable firm of
Denis-Mounie. Its virtues are
now starting to become recog-
nized in America.

Since we are living in a cost-
conscious period, it would be
remiss of us not to bring to your
attention the fact that this su-
perb brandy can be acquired
for less than 6.59 the bottle —
and for less than 75.00 the
Case. In our opinion, it can hold
its head high in open competi-
tion against other equally
worthy companions from Cog-
nac that might command more
than 2.00 the bottle more.

DELAMAIN PALE & DRY

      

£ PALE St

LE GO 4
| Pelamains’

During our recent stay in Paris,
we were astonished to see that
every renowned bar and out-
standing restaurant promi-
nently displayed and featured
DELAMAIN PALE & DRY
Cognac.

We subsequently met Mr. Dela-
main and were impressed by
his uncompromising dedication
to excellence, and his insist-
ence on producing a Cognac
of impeccable quality, pale In
color and dry to the palate.

This brandy lends itself to gift-
giving because each bottle is
housed in the beautiful box you
see above. (Below 162.45 case)

1966’ in handsome box.

packaging.)

Here is an eminently satisfying red wine
of Bordeaux, of the great 1966 vintage,
personally selected by Baron Philippe de
Rothschild, the proprietor of Chateau
Mouton Rothschild. Its excellence is
further endorsed by the fact that each
bottle bears the name of Baron Roths-
child, a distinguished authority on the
wines of Bordeaux. (34.45 the case of 6

CORDIAL MEDOC

In southwest France, in the
midst of the noble wine coun-
try, a much-admired liqueur Is
produced. It bears the simple
name CORDIAL MEDOC, but
the taste is not simple. There
is complexity, balance, and an
intriguing combination of fla-
vours when served. If you have
never tried it, we suggest that
you do—or send a bottle to an
inquisitive friend who likes 41
liqueurs. Below 8.99
