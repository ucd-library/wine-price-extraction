LARRESSINGLE ARMAGNAC

Armagnac comes from the land
of d’Artagnan, and Larressingle
is one of its leading disciples.
There is respect in France for
the excellence of this 10 Year
Old brandy—tich with earthy fla-
vor, well-balanced and crowned
with delightful bouquet. As you
can see, the cost is modest
enough. (Below 87.10 case)

In Moscow, served
chilled, this is the tradi-
tional holiday accom-
paniment to caviar and
various smoked fish. The
same kind of festivity and
gastronomic perfection
would prevail if you du-
plicated this on the
American scene during
the Yuletide period.

 

This is the kind of perfect
Vodka that can be served
chilled, as is, instead of a
Dry Martini, as a prelude
to the dinner party. (Be-
low 91.50 case)

“AGE”

 

CHIANTI RISERVA
DUCALE

The Wine & Food Society of
Italy consider this aged Chianti
from the old reserves of Ruffino
one of the best red wines pro-
duced in their country. It shows
characteristics rather similar to
an aged chateau-bottled claret,
and will continue to improve
with bottle age.

Six bottles (3.95 each) can be
sent in this beautiful, beautiful
wooden box and there is no
extra charge for this impressive
gift container.

BENEDICTINE and B & B
Each Can Be Poured Separately Out of the

Same 2 Compartment Bottle!

There is beauty, func-
tional usefulness, and
high excellence in this
two-headed Benedictine
creation.

In addition to its amusing
effect as a gift, it has the
practical virtue of permit-
ting you to serve the ex-
cellent Benedictine — and
for those who want it a bit
dryer, you are in a posi-
tion to immediately pour
the B & B, a combina-
tion of Benedictine and

brandy.

OLD HENNESSY COGNAC
IN BACCARAT DECANTER

What a fantastic one bottle gift!
The Baccarat Decanter is an
absolute beauty and commands
this price even when purchased
empty. The Cognac is not ordi-
nary, but the very aged Bras
d’Or quality of Hennessy. The
satin lined box adds a jewelry-
like quality to the gift.

BOTTLE &

LAURENT-PERRIER
GRAND SIECLE
1961

Louis XIV loved Cham-
pagne; made his whole
court drink it for ‘stom-
ach’s sake.’ Here is a
replica of the bottle
which he favored. Note
the beautiful Versailles
box in which it is housed.
A giant among Cham-
pagnes—expensive, but
worth it. (165.78 case)
