THE COUNTRY WINES
OF FRANCE

Here are the local ‘vin du pays’ wines of France that
bring so much joy to tourists who explore the French
countryside. Each has its own personality, its own mes-
sage, its own touch of charm. They were not easy to
come by since many of the growers are not export-
minded. Undoubtedly, you have heard about some of
them, have read of their virtues in literature—and we
happily bring them to you.
