sory at any British university.
Rather, it is the favored drink
of all Britain since it is now
the best-seller of Engfand.

BALLANTINE’S

Not a limply light scotch, nor
heavily harsh—BALLAN-
TINE’S adheres to the Gre-
cian precept of the ‘golden
mean.’ Had Pericles been
privileged to drink scotch,
this might have been his
choice. (Below 84.25 case).

CHAMPAGNE

The bottle is a pre-
cise replica of the
one presented to
Marie Antoinette,
Queen of France,
by Florens-Louis
Heidsieck in the
year 1785. Each

printed, just as it was done in the 18th century. The wine is
equally exceptional. It is the proud product of the choicest
reserves of the Piper-Heidsieck cellars. The grapes were
gathered during the great 1961 vintage. Each bottle is pre-
sented in a luxurious box, reflecting the best artisanship of

France. (175.50 case).

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

THE
PRESIDENT’S CHOICE
RARE BOURBON

Kentucky Bourbon at
its best—chosen for its
balance and flavor,
and set aside as a
private reserve for
the President of the
Brown-Forman Distil-
lery. Entirely remark-
able and ideally suited
as a unique bourbon
gift. (Below 104.31
case).

Given two weeks’ no-
tice, a special label
with the name of the
recipient and your
greetings can be im-
printed and affixed to
each bottle. However,
for practical reasons,
the minimum for spe-
cial printing is a full
case of 12 bottles (Be-
low 104.37).
