An interesting collection of
two red wines of great class
and two German wines of ex-
ceptional character.

358 CHATEAU LASCOMBES 1943 (Margaux)

Only after much persuasion were we able to convince the owners
of Chateau Lascombes to part with their last remaining ten
cases of 1943. Glorious for present drinking and modestly
priced indeed.

299 BEAUNE GREVES 1949

Estate Bottled, Duvault-Blochet

One of the hardest commodities for a wine merchant to acquire
is an authentic estate-bottled 1949 red Burgundy without flaws.
Here is one that has commanded our complete enthusiasm.

1955

Estate Bottled, Pfarrkirche St. Michael

The vineyard is owned by the Church of St. Michael on the
Moselle and the proceeds thereof go towards supporting the
Church. The devotion to the care of the vine and the cellar is

reflected in the outstanding quality shown by this truly mag-
nificent Moselle.

SCHLOSS VOLLRADS CABINET 1953
Estate Bottled, Graf Matuschka-Greiffenclau

In great years, the wines of Schloss Vollrads are among the
greatest of Germany. The title “Cabinet” is not given lightly

ere — it means the best of class and extraordinary wine of
great distinction.

The glories of Burgundy are
well represented here. These
are hard to come by and rep-
resent the best vinicultural ef-
forts of the owner-growers of
this district.

CLOS VOUGEOT 1952

Estate Bottled, Gouroux -

A classic red Burgundy from the largest and most famous of all
of the Burgundian vineyards.

VOSNE ROMANEE, BEAUMONT, 1953
Estate Bottled, Noillet

A Burgundian treasure that will compete with the greatest giants
of all. Magnificent today, it also has a brilliant future.

BONNE MARES 1953
Estate Bottled, Clair-Dau

In England, this is the most sought-after of all the red wine of
Burgundy. A dramatic wine experience.

BEAUNE, LES CRAS, 1947
Estate Bottled, Duvault-Blochet

Some of the most glorious wine of our generation was produced
during the 1947 vintage on the Cotes du Beaune. We proudly
announce the acquisition of this extraordinary 1947. It will soon
be gone so we urge that you order quickly.

ALOXE CORTON 1937
Estate Bottled, Doudet-Naudin

{any of you are familiar with the treasures of Naudin’s pre-war
cellar which we told you about a year ago. Here is one of the
great 1937s that was a worthy occupant of the ‘forgotten cellar
that was sealed back in 1942 and not opened until 1955.

303 CLOS BLANC DE VOUGEOT 1953

Estate Bottled, L’Heretier-Guyot
An extraordinary example of white Burgundy from the famed
Clos Vougeot vineyard. Exceptional breed and class.
