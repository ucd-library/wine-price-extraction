   

Here are several outstanding
wines of Europe at substantial
savings! Included is a classic
Claret and fresh, young white
wines.

628 CHATEAU LEOVILLE POYFERRE 1952
(St. Julien )
A classic example of fine Chateau-bottled Claret. From one of
the best vineyards of the St. Julien district. It is questionable

whether this wine can be purchased in Bordeaux today at this
price.

 

312 MACON BLANC, LEYNES, 1953
Estate bottled by J. Tissier. This, in our opinion, is the best
white Macon we have ever tasted.
| 433 POUILLY FUISSE 1953, LES MENETIERES
Very dry, slightly austere, exceptionally fine. Estate-bottled by
J. Burrier.
307 PETIT CHABLIS 1955, M. Remon
We herald this young Chablis as one of the freshest and most
delicate we have tasted in a long time.
408 VOUVRAY 1953, Diard

A continuous favorite among Americans. Fruity, dry.

178 CHATEAU RIEUSSEC 1953, (Sauternes )

A fabulous opportunity for those who like great Sauternes.
Normally commands more than twice the price.

992 WURZBURGER LINDLEINSBERG 1953
Estate Bottled, Julius Spital
This delightful dry white wine of F ranconia, attractively pre-

sented in the squat green bocksbeutel, is estate-bottled by a
celebrated hospital.

Impeccable examples of
estate-bottled and Chateau-
bottled thoroughbreds from
the great vineyards of France
and Germany. Based on pres-
ent replacement, each would
have to sell at considerably
higher levels.

407 HERMITAGE, LES MOINES, 1953

After much comparative tasting, we are convinced that “Les
Moines” is the best single example of Rhone Valley red wine
we have yet run across.

120 CHATEAU SMITH-HAUT-LAFITTE 1949

Bordeaux experts insist that this vineyard produced one of the
finest red wines in the Graves district of Bordeaux.

257 CHATEAU VIEUX CERTAN 1953

Because of the great frost damage that took place in the Pomerol
district, these wines are particularly sought-after and have gone
up astronomically in cost. Here is an exceptional example.

246 CHATEAU LA GAFFELIERE NAUDES
1953

A truly great St. Emilion—like Chateau Petrus in Pomerol, this
wine is much sought-after by Bordeaux wine lovers.

041 PIESPORTER GUNTERSLAY SPATLESE
1953 Estate Bottled, Kettern-Zerben

It is no ordinary event to get an impeccable Estate-bottled
Moselle of this calibre for a price such as this.

918 SANCERRE 1955 (Loire Valley )

Only 25 cases reached us and we offer them proudly. Here is
one of the best examples of Loire we have ever tasted.

509 NIERSTEINER HEILEGENBAUM
SPATLESE 1955 Estate Bottled, Reinhold Senfter

If you have not tried any 1955 Rhine wines, we know of no
better introduction than this outstanding Niersteiner produced
and bottled by Senfter, one of the best growers of the area.

Many exceptional values can

ularly recommend the Beyche-
ville, Chateauneuf-Du-Pape,
and the prize-winning Pouilly
Fuisse.

CHATEAU CLOS L’EGLISE 1953 (Pomerol )
There will be very little Pommerol available to the wine drinkers
of the world during the next few years because of the frost
damage. Here is one of the best—and beautifully priced.

CHATEAU BEYCHEVILLE 1952

(St. Julien)

Beycheville is now regarded in Bordeaux as a wine that is only
a notch below the great ‘first growths’ which sell for double the

price. Relatively quick to mature, this wine is entirely ready
for present drin ing.

CHATEAUNEUF DU PAPE,
Clos des Felibres, 1952

Estate Bottled, Raymond Fabre

After four days of tasting in the Rhone Valley, we definite]
came to the conclusion that this wine is a product of what
undoubtedly the best single vineyard in all of Chateauneuf-du-
pi Full, lusty, and yet it possesses its full share of elegance
and breed.

CHATEAU Cos D’ESTOURNEL 1953
(St. Estephe )

A Claret that is much sought-after by those who prefer their red
Bordeaux with greater depth and fragrance.

POUILLY FUISSE, BOUTHIERS, 1955

This remarkable Pouilly Fuisse recently won FIRST GRAND
AWARD at the Paris Fair as the best single example of Pouilly
Fuisse produced during the creak 1955 vintage. Estate
bottled by M. Dondin. Half bottles at $1.25 each.

CHATEAU LATOUR BLANCHE 1949

Second only to Chateau d’Yquem itself in reputation and rich-
ness of flavor. Normally sells for over $4.00.

Presenting two fine 1953
Estate-bottled Red Burgun-
dies, a glorious Meursault, and
two interesting white wines
from Alsace and the Loire.

VOLNAY, POUSSE D’OR, 1953

A fine Volnay—full of fruit, flavor and power—Estate-bottled
by Chavigne & Lavorielle.

BEAUNE, LES CRAS, 1953
One of our most popular red Burgundies. Estate bottled by
Duvault-Blochet.

CHATEAU FIGEAC 1953 (St. Emilion)

Knowing Claret experts consider Figeac one of the best wines
of the St. Emilion district—almost in a class with Ausone and
Cheval Blanc.

MEURSAULT GENEVRIERES 1953
Estate Bottled, Michelet

Our recent trip to Burgundy taught us one thing—a good Meur-
sault Genevricres can compete with a top flight Montrachet.
This outstanding example proves it beyond question.

GEWURZTRAMINER, GRAND CRU, 1953,
F. Hugel

Here is a great example of Alsatian white wine that can compete
seriously with some of the best vineyards of the Rhine.

POUILLY BLANC FUME 1955, Marchand

We have never tasted a better example of Pouilly Blanc F ume,
nor do we think it exists anywhere in the Loire. An amazing
wine.
