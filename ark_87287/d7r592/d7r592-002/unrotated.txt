A HAPPY MERGER

vASE S* months have now elapsed
since the merger of two of

America’s leading wine mer-
chants, SHERRY WINE &
SPIRITS CO., INC. and M. LEH-
MANN, INC. It has resulted in a
wider range of wines and spirits,
better service, a more educated
and dedicated staff, and savings
to our clientele.
