Here is the kind of wine served en carafe in the better country inns along the Paris-Riviera route. There is no
pretense here to greatness, but, nevertheless, it is a sound, light, entirely agreeable red table wine—especially in
warm weather. Half bottles at 84¢, $18.00 the case.

1952 was an exceedingly great year in the Rhone. This wine is splendid today and shows no trace of old age.
Worth much more if intrinsic merit were the only criterion.

of the red Burgundies. Quantity limited.
