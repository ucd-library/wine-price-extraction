Estate Bottled, M. Doudet

The picturesque and sleepy old city of Beaune is the wine capital of Burgundy. The wines (most of them red) that come from its
vine covered hillside are soft and gracious with fine texture. 1947, of course, was a very great year indeed and the Clos du Roi
is one of Beaune’s best vineyards.

fe your “I find on going over my notes, that I tasted nearly 200 red wines in Burgundy last summer,” says Frank Schoonmaker. “This superb
1949 is certainly one of the half dozen best, and quite comparable even to ‘he Grand Chambertin of this exceptional year. The Clos
de la Roche is less than a half mile from Le Chambertin and this particular wine has all the depth and power that one expects from
the greatest Burgundies.”

Estate Bottled, Domaine de la Romanee Conti

os The wines of the Domaine de la Romance Conti have consistently commanded the highest price on the world market for its red
rishi wines. Perhaps the most valuable piece of vineyard ground in all of Burgundy, with the possible exception of the Romance Conti
ania vineyard itself, is “La Tache.” The owners of the Domaine are particularly proud of the breed, lightness and balance achieved by
’ oo La Tache during the 1950 vintage. An exceptional opportunity to acquire a thoroughbred red wine at relatively modest cost.
