 

More and more Americans have adopted the French habit of drinking their Beaujolais young, while the fruit and freshness of the
new wine are at their peak. At the Same time, America is beginning to recognize that getting led -et-celtio denominator Beaujolais
is not enough, and they are asking for more and more examples of the finer Beaujolais—from such superior Beaujolais communes
as Fleurie (renowned for its fine bouquet), and Moulin-a-Vent (known for its fuller flavor and staying powers).

The honest, unstretched Beaujolais of 1966 and 1967, from good vineyard soil and estate-bottled, are fruity, flowery and very pleasant.
They have proved beyond original expectations and are, today, ready for drinking—young and fresh. Among the best we have ever

tasted are those produced by the Rt. Hon. Ernest Marples (who not only is present] an M.P. but Cabinet Mini f
eleven years). At his estates can be found some of the best vineyard land of Beaujolais. radia attired cs lias

387 BEAUJOLAIS BROUILLY, 1967 on carafe................................... 1.99 21.40

As they say in “My Fair Lady”, “We think we got it.” The wine is a 1967 Beaujolais from the famed Brouilly district, which shows
its fruit, flavor and sturdiness immediately. Its age can be counted in months rather than years. But that’s not all! It comes not in
a bottle but in a pitcher or carafe, which is a thing of beauty in its own right. The wine once consumed, then remains one of the
most delightful carafes you have ever owned—the kind they would charge at least $3.00 for in any department store even though

empty. The shipment arrives in late June, so please order now and get your share for summer gifts for your friends and for your
own enjoyment.

S04 GAINT AMOUR, 1906, Nivolns,......5.5..55 8... 2.19 23.65

What a pretty name! What a lovely wine! Northernmost of the 9 wine-producing communes of the Beaujolais, fruity, quite soft,
quick to mature.

333 BROUILLY, 1966, Rt. Hon. Ernest Marples................................... 2.19 24.97
We have just returned from Mr. Marples’ 15th century Chateau where he bottles this wine. We were impressed by his dedication
with quality. An economic, magnificent Beaujolais that shows the promise of long life.

801 BEAUJOLAIS VILLAGES, 1967, Vin de I'Annee ............................ 2.19 23.65

This wine was only a grape 8 months ago. It has since been harvested, vinified, put in the barrel, then in bottle and finally found its
joyous way to New York. This is the very wine that is now being served in the great restaurants and bistros of Paris. Its over-
whelming fruit and grapy bouquet combine to give it the kind of attraction associated with “a pretty young girl from the farm”’.
Here is sheer, unadulterated fun for terrace, lawn and beach. Why don’t you send a case to your country address now?

2418 MIORGON, 1966, Depardos ..........4 3. 2.49 26.90

Frank Schoonmaker found this superb Beaujolais for us. He points out “‘it is less fruity than other Beaujolais, matures less quickly
and takes on, with time, a marked resemblance to the Burgundies of the Cote d’Or.” You'll love it.

788 CHENAGS, 1966, Rt. Hon. Ernest Memes... 3.22... os... 2.50 28.50
The Commune of Chenas is bounded on the north by Julianas and on the south by Fleurie. It is Beaujolais at its most typical.

The town is picturesque, lovely; Mr. Marples’ small country house could only be found after we got precise instructions from the
local Postmaster. On the terrace we tasted his 1966 and found it not just good but excellent, attractive, rich in color and fragrance,
delicious. We think it needs another 3 to 4 months to reach its peak.

797 MOULIN-A-VENT 1966, Rt. Hon. Ernest Marples............................ 2.85 32.49

Considered the most famous of all the Beaujolais and generally commands well over $3.00. It is the most long-lived of them all.
Sturdy, deep in color and with above-average amount of finesse and breed.

128. BEAUIOLAIG, 1900; ls Bein |... has ss eo ca 3.99 23.26
A Bonbonne is equal to 68o0zs. or almost 3 bottles.
Frank Schoonmaker found this Beaujolais for us. A favorite of the frugal French household because you get a week’s supply for
little. One Bonbonne, a giant bottle, holds almost 3 bottles (68 ounces). It doesn’t contain ordinary wine but estate-bottled Beaujolais
from the local growers’ co-operative. Figure it out yourself—you’ll see how much you'll save—and why not have a few around for
your picnic dining?

 

1964 is one of the best vintages of the decade in Bordeaux. This applies less to regional wines than it does to the Chateaux because
regionals shoot for an average taste, whereas the Chateaux are either the heros or victims of a particular vintage of a particular
year. In this instance, we decided not to settle for what is pleasant but undistinguished, but shoot for the stars. These wines have
their own individuality and excellence and yet are not expensive.

The wines were shipped in cask from the Chateaux to the cellars of Talleyrand in Bordeaux where they were bottled and untouched
by any other wine. And all of the 1964 vintage exclusively. We can state unhesitatingly that during the 35 years we have been wine
merchants, not we, nor anyone, have offered wines of such integrity and background at such relatively low prices. All are available
in half bottles at $3.00 the case additional.
