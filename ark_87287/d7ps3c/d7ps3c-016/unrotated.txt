delicacy. If you want to drink great red Burgundy, vibrantly alive with fruit and charm, drink these for the next few
years—and you will match wine pleasure of a previous generation, who were equally lucky with the 1934s—a vintage

similar in its character.

We quote from the notes of M. Trinquet, the man who cared for this wine, “Robe of garnet, beautiful perfumed bouquet. A truly great

wine capable of rivalling even a fine Chambertin. Approved by the Chevaliers du Tastevin.”

Pierre Poupon
What neighbors! Richebourg is bounded on the south by Romanée-Conti and the east by Romanée St. Vivant. Less than 2,000 cases
are produced per year; generally it is fuller, deeper in color and “bigger’’ than its adjoining vineyards in the town of Vosne-Romanée.

Most of this vineyard is owned by the Domaine de la Romanée-Conti.

304 ROMANEE ST. VIVANT 12.50 133.00

Pierre Poupon
Adjoins Romanée-Conti and Richebourg. Only 23 acres in size, most of the yield being vinified by Joseph Drouhin. Here is one of the
best ones we have tasted, truly full, remarkable bouquet, great finesse, and capable of competing and holding its own with any red Burgundy

you have ever tasted.
