LOOKING FOR “BEST BUYS”?

Old Jeb 6 Yr. Kentucky Bourbon is
‘“New York’s best bourbon value’”’ states
James Beard . . . and Sam Clay 10 Yr.
Old Bourbon probably costs less than
what you are now paying for general
run-of-the-mill whiskies . . . if you are
looking for the best bourbon in the land,
please try Collector’s Item 14 Yr. Old
-it is on sale... .

We think there is no better value for the
price conscious scotch drinker than
Douglas ‘‘Board Member’s Choice”’ . . .
have you ever tried James Boswell
Scotch ?... and from that 250 Year Old
Shrine—Fortnum & Mason’s of Lon-
don, comes their superb Gin and Scotch
noth on tale . . . and from St.
Edmund Hall in the University of
Oxford there is now available the
carefully chosen Cognac, Gin and
Scotch ... and S. S. Pierce of Boston
sends us their wonderful Gin and Vodka
bearing the name Back Bay—and at
what a delightful cost to you!
