   

FTER many agreeable days of
A greatness and prosperity, the harsh
reality of life has struck the land of the
Bordelais . After two “vintages of the
century” (’59 and ’61) in rapid and
glorious succession (followed by an as-
tonishingly good vintage 1962), the
pendulum has swung again.

As I sit sipping my apéritif in the bar
of the Hotel Splendide, I can see the
wine négociants around me. Their faces
are longer than they were. There are
fewer smiles. The damage from rot in
1963 was tragic, particularly in St-
Emilion and Pomerol.

Still all is not lost, by any means: not
all the wine this year will be bad, and
some of the exceptions will be wonderful
ones. This, in fact, is going to be a good
vintage for those who discriminate and
study. In the Graves district I tasted a
superb Haut Brion 1963, and was aston-
ished by its good color and its depth of
flavor. Indeed, Mr. J. Delmas, the
young, knowledgeable regisseur, tells me
that all the elements exist to make it
even better than his ’60s—which have
proved very good.

In the Medoc there will be good wines
surrounded by a vast quantity of bad
ones, The problem will be to pick and

choose, unlike the ’59s, ’61s and 62s,
where you can buy without hesitation.
But this is not a bad thing perhaps:
there is a lot of pleasure to be had in
making one’s choice, and there will be
first-class bargains to be picked up by the
connotsseur here,

I have tasted everywhere, and come
to one conclusion: there is a hidden treas-
ure—a Fort Knox—in Bordeaux for
those who seek it out. It is the 1961
vintage of a great vineyard! I recom-
mend doing the following: buy the "ls,
thinking ahead to what you will be able
to use three years from now and beyond.
Put them away, quietly and carefully.
Forget about them. When you open

them, be prepared for the greatest wine
surprise of your lifetime!

But remember: the time to buy is
NOW. In two years these wines will be
either unavailable or hopelessly expen-
sive.

The reason? Well, a vineyard such as
Chateau Lafite Rothschild produced
only fifty tonneaux, instead of the nor-
mal 150, and Haut Brion produced less
than forty, instead of the normal 100.
Most of this has gone now, but a few
cases remain at the property. Prices are
high, over $85 to the trade for the Lafite,
for instance, but these will seem low a
few years from now. Buy them and
treasure them as a growth investment.
But make sure they come from a noble
vineyard of Medoc, St-Emilion or Pom-
erol!

Now: some observations of a travel-
ler. The sole served at Chateau Lafite
Rothschild was accompanied by a sweet,
well-chilled white wine of great finesse
and charm. Chateau Coutet 1950. It
was followed by Lafite Rothschild
1945 and 1926!

The dinner at Haut Brion, graci-
ously given by Seymour Weller, Manag-
ing Director, featured Haut Brion blanc
1949, Haut Brion 1960 and Haut Brion
1945. And was climaxed by a legendary
and very much alive Haut Brion 1908!

Chateau Latour has now been sold
to an English group and has become
guidance responsibility of Harry Waugh
of Harvey’s, Bristol. (The English orig-
inally conquered France because of the
wealth of her vineyards, and were
thrown out by Joan of Arc, and forced
to fall back on Port as a national drink.
Now it seems they are going to buy their
way back!)

I tasted a Chateau La Cote Bellevue
1962 that has just been bottled and will

   

be in New York during the early Spring.
It will be a delight for immediate drink-
ing—charming, soft, fruity and with as-
tonishing finesse. It is from the Cote de
Bourg, and will be available from
Sherry’s at $1.49 a bottle, $16.50 a
case. This is not a wine to store and keep.
It’s a wine to buy and drink now, and a
bargain.

NE of the fastest trains in the
world takes the voyager from
Paris to Dijon, and, for the first time
in all my visits, I found the town blank-
eted under two feet of snow. I was sorry
not to have brought a fur parka with me!

My tastings started in the South of
Burgundy, with white wines provided
by various branches of the Ramonet
family. (The oldest brother was Pierre
Ramonet-Prudhon; his younger brother
was Claude Ramonet. Then there is the
sister’s family, Bachelet-Ramonet, and
finally, André Ramonet-Prudhon, a
junior branch. Altogether a complicated
family tree. )

For over two decades they have
guarded their reputation as “impeccable
wine makers”, and my January experi-
ence on their own terrain more than con-
firmed their remarkable merit. They
believe, quite simply, in Good Wine.
