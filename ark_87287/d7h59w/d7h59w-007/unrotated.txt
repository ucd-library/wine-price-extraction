estate-bottied if any sugar is add-
ed to the fermentation. During the
1963 vintage, almost 90% had to
be sugared. The 1961 estate bot-
tlings are delightful, almost gone
at the vineyards, and quite ex,
pensive. Here is a choice

collection at phenomenally
low cost.

 
     
     
         
   
  
  
 
  
   
 
  
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 

Peering into the future our advice is to get
bold of these good estate bottlingsâ€”they
are rapidly disappearing from the German
scene and we do believe they are a bit
better than the succeeding vintages of 1962
and 1963. The price is astonishing and
what a wonderful opportunity to simply go
right ahead and acquire now what you
think you might need for this coming sum-
mer. We know that we will not be able to
duplicate these values and we question
whether you will find wines of this caliber
at a price such as this anywhere else in the
land,
