Although 1958 is not classified as “very great,” we are amazed to
find how outstandingly good some of the wines are proving to be.
1958 was that kind of a year—those who picked very late, two weeks
after their neighbors in Burgundy, produced outstanding successes.
The leaders in this late picking, because they were prepared to risk
disaster if the weather proved bad, to protect the quality of their
world-famous wines, were the Domaine de la Romance Conti and
Comte de Vogue. We have conducted several blind tastings; and in
each instance the ’58s are proving more attractive for present drink-
ing from these proprietors than even their ’59s. 58s here represent
a beautiful harmony of lightness, finesse and flavor. If you want good
wine that is not determined by the vintage that appears on the label
but by what is in the bottle, here are five glorious examples.

140 GRANDS ECHEZEAUX. . .53.79 62.50

Estate bottled, Domaine de la Romanee Conti

Something quite remarkable happens to red wine at the Domaine de la Romance
Conti and we have not yet quite found out the secret. The superior soil of
Grands Echezeaux is shared by other owners but nowhere does it reach the
heights that it does here.

875 BONNES MARES. ... . 6.59 21.47
Estate bottled, Comte de Vogue

We were sceptical when the importer. Michel Dreyfus, brought us a bottle to
lunch in January. He did not tell us the year and we tasted it. Our enthusiasm
was sufficiently high to persuade us to buy his last remaining 18 cases. A won-
derful red Burgundy,

238 RICHEBOURG. ... . . « 2.65 85.00
Estate bottled, Domaine de la Romanee Conti

One of the greatest of the wines produced at the Domaine de la Romanee Conti.
The distinction of the Richebourg soil is apparent here.

290 MUSIGNY,
VIELLES VIGNES. ... . 449 80.90
Estate bottled, Comte de Vogue

Very few vines in Burgundy predate 19th Century phylloxera, when most of the
vines of France were destroyed. Those that did yield a ee small quantity
of wine per acre but the concentration is tremendous and the quality is superb.
Here is such a noble survivor.

231 IA TACHE . Cc St BT.
Estate bottled, Domaine de la Romanee Conti

One of our most knowledgable wine followers and a man who treasures his
collection of great red Burgundies recently stated: ‘“To my palate La Tache 1958
is the best single red Burgundy I tasted since the war.” We do not necessarily
agree with this rather strong statement but we do agree that it is a remarkable
wine end is among the giants of the post war pericd.

294 GRANDS ECHEZEAUX. . 4.49 49.50
Estate bottled, Gouroux

Sturdy when we first tasted it but it now beginning to come around and show
its true worth. Will be amazingly long-lived.

242 BEAUNE, CUVEE
GUIGONS DE SALINS. . . 5.89 64.95
Hospices de Beaune

One of the best barrels presented at the 1957 auction of the Hospices de Beaune.
Softening up and now pleasing for present drinking.

287 LA HOMANER. . i: 2°. ge 87.50
Estate bottled, Leroy

This small “back yard” vineyard of less than 2 acres is rated on the highest
level of any land in Burgundy. 200 cases are produced when they are lucky. A
collectors item. The 1961 sells for over $100 the case in Burgundy!

745 BEAUNE GREVES, Sek ne veer
LES MURGERS. .... 2399 43.95
Estate bottled, Moillard

The lesser 1955 red Burgundies are now showing up a bit tired. The good ones,
such as this one from the best land in Beaune, is an absolute delight to those
who like mature, at-its-peak red wine.

794 CLOS DE VOUGEOT. . . 6.99 48.00

Estate bottled, J. Drouhin

The vineyard is impeccable and so is Mr. Drouhin. It is no ordinary wine event
to run across an authentic 1955 survivor of this excellent vineyard.

248 BEAUNE GREVES. ... 4.99 54.95

Estate bottled, Roger Duchet

are looking for a full, lusty Burgundy, ignore this one. The distinguishing
te nceieice pi lightness, delicacy, ee teak bouquet. Subtlety here replaces

power.

251 BEAUNE GREVES. ... 5.49 60.56

Estate botiled, Roger Duchet

The Mayor of Beaune owns this vineyard, grows the wine and parted with
his 1952 ewe rather reluctantly. Remarkably different from the 1953 above
from the same grower and vineyard. Strength and body enters here and the

flavor is much fuller but not as delicate.

252 BEAUNEGREVES ... . 5.99 65.95

Estate bottled, Roger Duchet

The year goes down in the annals. We have never run across another 1947
Burgundy of equal heritage anywhere in our travels in France or America.
A collectors item.
