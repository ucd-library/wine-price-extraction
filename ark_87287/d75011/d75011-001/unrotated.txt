HERE IS A GIFT IDEA that is imaginative and individ-

ual — your friend need not be a sophisticated wine expert

The bottles ultimately chosen were the result of careful
comparative tastings by our associate, Sam Aaron—based
on an article—‘“How to Build A Library of Wine” which
he recently wrote for HOUSE BEAUTIFUL. We know of

few gifts that provide as much excitement and interest.
