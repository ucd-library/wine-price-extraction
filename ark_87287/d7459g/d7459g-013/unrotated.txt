the case. But here at Sherrys, we do not use
replacement cost, but our ORIGINAL
COST, immediately after the vintage, as the

basis for determining our selling prices.

But soon our inventory will run out and our
prices will be forced to reflect the present
market. Therefore, we suggest early acquisi-
tion because these offerings are limited to
our holdings which will surely be exhausted
soon. In spite of these amazingly low prices
for the First Growths, we still think you
should turn to Page 13 where there are

many other clarets being offered, quite in

levels.
