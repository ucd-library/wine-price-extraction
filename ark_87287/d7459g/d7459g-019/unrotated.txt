Earlier this year, our unmatchable collection of authentic Vintage
Ports was offered on sale to encourage our clientele to try one of the
noblest of the world’s great wines. The results were astonishing and
most of the vintages were sold out almost immediately. An important
shipment of replacements has just re: ached us from the extraordinary
cellars of Richard Hooper & Sons, an English firm which has been
located for over 180 years in Oporto, Portugal. To satisfy the interest
of those who were unable to take advantage of our previous sale a full
collection is being offered once again at a 10% reduction until July

Toth.

The history of these Ports is interesting indeed. The Hoopers main-
tained a private Port museum in their country house in Douro, where
they collected, over the years, a treasury of Vintage Ports, usually
starting with about 25 cases for each year. Honored guests in the home
were asked the date of their birth, and Vintage Port of that year was
served. In 1951, the Richard Hooper business was sold to a Portuguese
firm. Along with the sale went their Port museum. Not interested in
living there, the Portuguese successors kept back 24 bottles of each
year to maintain the museum, and sold the remainder to Sherry’s,
We have put them on sale during this period so that you will be
encouraged to try this truly remarkable wine, beloved by connoisseurs

the world over — authentic Vintage Port.
