FORTNUM & MASON
LONDON DRY GIN
4.69 the bottle

54.25 the case

‘The London of the past, with its
history of its “Gain Palaces’ has
ultimately developed a fantastic
popularity for the city’s dry
Gin, that has spread far beyond
Victoria’s empire — today it is
asked for in every conceivable
language. Fortnum continues the
tradition with an exceptionally
fine, smooth, dry Gin that sup-
plies the correct and proper basis
for a good Martini and superla-
tively fine warm weather tall
drinks. And pleasantly enough,
we report that the cost to you of
this Gin — the best of London
— is substantially below what
you have been accustomed to pay
for fine imported Gin.

FORTNUM & MASON
1952 BRUT CHAMPAGNE

5.49 the bottle
59.50 the case

The anathema of all sound
Champagne-drinking Britishers
is a sweet Champagne — “out,
out” they cry, even if it is slightly
sweet. This may account for
their dry humor! At any rate,
the term English Market when
applied to Champagne means a
light, clean, bone (we repeat,
bone) dry wine produced in the
Champagne district with the
least possible amount of sugar
dosage added. We urge you to

try a bottle or two of Fortnum &
Mason’s carefully selected Eng-
lish Market Brut 1952 at $5.49
the bottle, $59.50 the case.

FORTNUM & MASON
DRY FINO SHERRY

2.99 the bottle
34.75 the case

We salute the new trend that
calls for “Sherry on the rocks”
as an intriguing and different
summer aperitif. Here is a true
Fino — bone dry, very pale, and
resplendent in its cooling effects.
We suggest that you ward off
summer’s heat by serving this
chilled, in an icy glass, or, if you
prefer, on the rocks.

The American visitor who feels
he may be leaving behind htm
something he relishes from his
visit to Fortnum & Mason’s will
find on his return to New York,
the same measure of service,
friendliness and personal atten-
tion in our shop (Sherry’s) on
Madison Avenue, where the
wines and spirits of Fortnum’s
will greet him once again.
