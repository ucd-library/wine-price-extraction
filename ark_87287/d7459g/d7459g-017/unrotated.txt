530 — LIEBFRAUMILCH 1955

Shipped by Gebreuder Lob 1.19
Any soft Rheinhessen wine can legally be called “Lieb-
fraumilch” and with latitude, it is little wonder that

many an undeserving wine bears this name. | lere, how-

ever, is one of true Liebfraumilch finish and character,

not too dry, not too sweet.

519 — HOCHHEIMER DAUBHAUS 1955

Shipped by F. Kreis
Hochheim marks the beginning of the famous Rheingau s
vine-covered slopes along the river and its wines for years
were the most renowned (the English word “Hock” was
taken from it). The Hochheimer has the elegance and the
fine flavor that distinguishes the best of the German

srowths.

559 — NIERSTEINER HEILIGENBAUM
SPATLESE 1955 Estate Bottled, Senfter
Heiligenbaum means “Holy Tree’ — and from this vine-
vard comes this soft, beautifully balanced Niersteiner.
Dry, fruity, vel subtle on the palate.

572 — OPPENHEIMER SACKTRAGER
SPATLESE 1955
Estate Bottled, R. Senfter
An extraordinary estate-bottled Oppenheimer, from one
of its best vineyards, and at an extraordinary orice.

2.49

Fresh, lively.

644 — RUDESHEIMER BERG
ROSENECK SPATLESE KABINETT 1955
Estate Bottled, F. Rucker

One of the fullest flavored of the Rheingau erowths, this
Rudesheimer lacks the Habby softness of the Rude-
sheimers of occasional vintages; it is lean, smooth and

 

2.69

full of flavor and at the same time, quite dry. An admira-
ble example.

533 — SCHLOSS JOHANNISBERGER
CABINET AUSLESE 1953

Estate of Prince von Metternich 4.99
The aristocrats of aristocrats, here is a 1953 Cabinet
Auslese, the choicest jewel of this magisterial vineyard
produced in many years. None remains in Germany—one
of the Preal Rheingaus of our time.
