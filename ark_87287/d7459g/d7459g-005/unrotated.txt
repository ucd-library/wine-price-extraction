Bee PE RIAGON RED SEAL... ew tt 5.69 66.00

Many of you have developed great affection for this truly distinguished Scotch whisky from the 250 year old London firm
of Fortnum & Mason. Only last month, many cases were sold at a higher level. We could not refrain from including this
Scotch thoroughbred, a favorite among the whisky drinkers of London, in our summer sale. Surely the equal of many Scotches

that sell for $7.00 or more. Undoubtedly, the best value in well balanced, fine old Scotch whisky that prevails anywhere in
the New York area.
