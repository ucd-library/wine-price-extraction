We asked James Beard, noted wine and
food authority, to select four different
wines, without relation to price, that he
considers his absolute favorites. Here
they are — THREE BOTTLES EACH
that will make up a mixed case designed
to satisfy the most demanding, palate.

One of the great dry white wines of
the world.

BEAUNE GREVES 1993

Full of fruit and warmth, magnificent.

In Mr. Beard’s opinion, the best vine-
yard of Moselle.
