When the S.S. American Miller slipped into
the New York harbor on November 13th
she brought in the first shipment of the great
1949 Rhines and Moselles which many pre-

is therefore with a distinct feeling of pride
that we offer you these great 1949s, which
you will find on the following page. Each
one is an original bottling or an original
growth. Each represents the best vineyards
of the Rhine, Moselle and Palatinate.

“T have tasted 800-odd Rhine wines, most
of them 1949s, and I cannot recall an aver-
age of quality so high”, says Frank Schoon-
maker. “No more expensive than wines of
comparable quality were before the war —
it will certainly be worth half again as much
a year or 18 months from now. Any bottles
of 1949 that you buy, will pay large dividends

And here is the vintage report just
received from Herr Josef Becker, of
Niederwalluf-on-the-Rhine. Herr Becker
is internationally known as a leading
expert in Rhine wines. His advice and
his tasting judgement are sought and
valued by such vineyards as Schloss
Johannisberg and Schloss Vollrads.
Below, translated, is his appraisal of
the last five Rhine vintages.

1945: Great year, excellent wines but
small quantity because of frost.

1946: Good average wines; good
Spatlesen and Auslesen.

1947: Great wine, great quantity, but
slow to mature.

1948: Balanced, harmonious wine,
fruity, distinguished, develop-
ing well.

continued Frank Schoonmaker, eminent wine
authority.

British Expert Lauds 1949

After tasting the 1949s in their various stages
since their first racking, British wine expert
A. J. Koenen, was quoted in England’s lead-
ing wine magazine, Harper’s Wine & Spirits
Gazette, that the 1949 vintage “is the finest
balanced that he has handled since that of
1889 and is of the opinion that-it will excel
in finesse the four vintages of 1893, 1911,
1921 and 1934; even the exceptionally fine
and beautifully balanced 1937s will be sur-
passed by the wines of 1949... for quality
there is every indication that this year will
be looked upon as ‘the Vintage of the
Century’.” (See Listings Next Page).
