News: “German wines are woefully ignored in the

New York market. A lot of it can be attributed to

sheer ignorance and a kind of blind obeisance to
the all-powerful chardonnay—which seems to be the only
name on anybody's lips these days.

“And perhaps it is an easier name to pronounce than say
Urziger Wurzgarten Kabinett Riesling Halbtrocken....
The '85 vintage . . . is considered superior to 1986 because of
the number of better wines at the sweeter levels of Spatlese
and Auslese.”

Below is a choice collection of outstanding estate-bottled
Rhine and Moselle wines mostly harvested during the superb
1985 vintage—a vintage ready to drink now and over the
summer days ahead. Wines of this character, sensitivity,
bouquet and subtle flavor will add a new dimension to your
warm weather entertaining and will bring joy and welcomed
surprises to your guests and family.

isten to the words of Barbara Ensrud, syndicated wine

columnist. We quote from an article which appeared

in the N.Y. Daily News:

“| sometimes wonder if people will ever wake up
to the fact that Alsace wines represent some of the best
values in the wine market? It’s an old story that these
wines are underrated and undervalued. Yet there is still
confusion about what these wines are—or aren't ...
they must be sweet, mustn't they”...

“Whoa. Stop right there. The similarities end the
moment you taste the wines. They are not German, they
are French; they are not sweet, they are quite dry...

“While such greatness is possible with Alsace wines, it
is the young ones that offer such excellent value, starting
with the dry but simple Sylvaner. . . .”
