concentration and a high ratio of tannin. Consequently, these
intense Burgundies will be rich and long-lived.

1980 VINTAGI

Squeezed between the 1978s and 1979s on the one hand, and

discovered in this vintage, provided one chooses with care.

potential.

The most drinkable wines and the best values to be found
among red Burgundies are the fabulous 1979s. The quality of
the vintage is top-flight, and the wines have a long life ahead.
We urge you to acquire these deliciously drinkable Burgundy
gems now—before they are all gone.

Each of these red Burgundies is estate-bottled by a grower
of impeccable reputation. These superb 1979s are no longer
commercially available in Burgundy, and the few that remain
fetch higher prices at the vineyard than the low sale prices you
see below. All are on sale.

Domaine des Lambrays
Like Clos de la Roche,

Clos des Lambrays is a

Denis. Most of the
vineyard is planted with
pre-phylloxera vines,
which gives the wine great
depth, long, lingering
flavor, and complexity. It
is a worthy member of
Burgundy’s hall of fame and should fetch, like some of its
neighbors, $700 the case. Truly great—quantities limited—

urge ordering promptly. (562)
