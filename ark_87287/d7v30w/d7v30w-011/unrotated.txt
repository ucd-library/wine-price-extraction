“This vintage, while not a great vintage like 1982, or even
a very good vintage like 1983 or 1978, has produced a
surprising number of good wines that have more concen-
tration, tannin, and character than the 1980 vintage....
“In the Medoc, the top wines show surprisingly good
color, are tannic, medium-bodied and, where the wine-
maker employed a warm, long fermentation, adequately
rich and long on the palate. They will certainly outlast the
1980s as they are primarily 100% Cabernet Sauvignon
wines, and should have a life span of at least’ 10-12 years.”
