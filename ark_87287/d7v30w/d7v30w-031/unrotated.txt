e have often been asked by the wine press and

knowledgeable wine consumers: “How is it possible

for you to offer scarce, estate-bottled Burgundy

gems at such low prices—in a world of only 5.5
French francs to the dollar and very high prices at the
vineyards?

Our response is that we acquired the ’79s, 80s, 81s and ’83s
when the dollar was more favorable—and we simply base the
prices you see here on our original cost and not on
replacement cost. As for the highly coveted, truly great 1985s,
we received generous allocations from our Burgundy
friends with whom we have been trading since 1937. To make
these wine nuggets readily available to our clientele, we have
reduced our mark-up. If you are ready for a Burgundy
adventure, we can think of no better time or place to start
than here and now—with the list below.

Robert Parker speaks with glowing words about the 1985
Red Burgundy wines which have become truly scarce both at
the vineyards and in the cellars of the importers:

“| have no hesitation in saying that they [the 1985s] are
the deepest, richest, most seductive and delicious red
burgundies | have ever tasted....The wines explode with
pure pinot noir fruit, are lush and full bodied, quite
concentrated and moderately tannic....]
unequivocally believe that this is a vintage that Burgundy
has only once every |5 or 20 years....”

 

1985 VINTAGE

Here is a vintage that comes but once in a generation.
Although its style has been likened to the outstanding 1978
vintage, one must perhaps go back to the historic 1959 vintage
to find its equal. Terry Robards proclaims that “the wines are
exquisite... rich with fruit and extract, concentrated, aromatic,
balanced and utterly delicious. They are big, strong wines of
great character...” And Robert Finigan calls 1985 “The Best
Vintage in Years” and comments: “In Burgundian Pinot Noir,
one wants a clear expression of the grape, with that silkiness,
that impression of near-sweetness .... The best 1985s are just
such wines, delightfully precocious but well enough structured
underneath to promise lovely evolution.”

We have selected some of the true gems of this extra-
ordinary red Burgundy vintage—choose among them from
the list below. Remember, the premiers and grands crus,
which are scarce, will probably all disappear quickly. Critics
proclaim the offering belowas possibly the largest selection of
top-flight red Burgundy available anywhere in America.
