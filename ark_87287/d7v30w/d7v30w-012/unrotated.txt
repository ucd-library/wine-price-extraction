Since its infancy, 1982 has been the heralded vintage of the
century. It is considered by many wine critics to be in the same
class as the 1929, 1945, 1949, 1953, and 1961 vintages. Robert
Parker comments: “...never have technology and nature
combined so dramatically and brilliantly to produce so many
superlative wines.”

We urge that you acquire your 1982s now, before they
become but a fond memory.

Scarce, superb. A great vineyard at its best. (481)

LYNCH-BAGES (Pauillac) 28.95 347.40
Similar to its neighbor Mouton-Rothschild in style, weight
and depth. Another “rising star.” (884)

MONTROSE (St.-Estephe) 28.95 347.40
Essential characteristics are concentration, inkiness and
longevity. Buy this one to drink a decade hence. (607)

GRUAUD-LAROSE (St.-Julien) 32.50 375.00

One of the giants of the 82 vintage. Scarce. (341)

BRANAIRE-DUCRU (St.-Julien) 33:2) 999.00
Rated 93 by Robert Parker, who comments: “Branaire-
Ducru is one of those curiously underrated, undervalued
properties that somehow gets forgotten when wine
enthusiasts discuss their favorite wines.” (716)

COS D’ESTOURNEL (St.-Estephe) 48.50 582.00
A giant. Competes with First Growths. (706)

LA CONSEILLANTE (Pomerol) 49.75 597.00

great. Provides an amazing wine tasting experience. (917)

DUCRU-BEAUCAILLOU (St.-Julien) 53.95 647.40

Chief Medoc rival to Leoville-Las-Cases in price. (1069)

LEOVILLE-LAS-CASES (St.-Julien) 58.25 699.00

benchmark by which the other great vineyards are judged.
As close to perfection as possible. (769)

MOUTON-ROTHSCHILD 119.00 1,350.00
Pauillac. Ultimately Mouton-Rothschild 1982 may surpass
the Lafite 1982 in price. A few reasons for this are: |.
Robert Parker rated Mouton ’82 a score of 100, or
perfection! 2. The man who provided the art for the label
was the famed, late film director John Huston. 3. Mouton
’82 can no longer be found on the Bordeaux market. (939)

LAFITE-ROTHSCHILD (Pauillac) 125.00 1,425.00
With Petrus ’82 fetching over $300 the bottle, the truly
great and remarkable Lafite 1982 at $125 can be considered
an opportunity not to be overlooked. There is every reason
to believe that Lafite ’82, a collector's item, will demand a
king’s ransom 2 or 3 years hence. (878)

“CAUGHT IN THE SHADOW OF THE 1982 BORDEAUX”
—that’s how The Wine Advocate characterizes the excellent
1981 Bordeaux vintage. It is a classic, long-lived, outstanding
vintage. Although these 1981 Bordeaux do not share the great
drama and world publicity of the historic 1982s, they
admirably supplement the ‘bs, affording the wine drinker a
wider range of Bordeaux's best.

Even more important is the fact that they are ready to serve
at your table now—ready for immediate drinking, with over
ten years of development ahead.

HAUT-BRION (Graves) 45.75 549.00
At a recent dinner at Chateau Haut-Brion, Duc Philippe de
Mouchy served us Haut-Brion 1981. We were astonished
