examples of the vintner’s art—and they are indis-

putably some of the best wine values available today.

growing renown: “High quality... and modest, sometimes
shockingly low prices should propel Australia’s wines into
international prominence over the next several
years ... Australian wines represent fertile hunting grounds
for the value conscious wine consumer.”

selection of Australian wines all show a sure hand with the
world’s classic grape varieties. Join us in joyous exploration of
this “new world” of wine—and enjoy our low sale prices that
