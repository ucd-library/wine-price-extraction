EMARKABLE 1985

any of us have availed ourselves of the opportunity
to acquire Bordeaux futures. Those who purchased
as futures the Haut-Brion or Beychevelle 1961,
1966 or 1970 certainly do not regret buying the
wine while it was still in barrel. They were rewarded by the
certainty of getting the wine of their selection before it
became scarce, and enjoyed the privilege of watching the
prices double and then go up ten-fold with the passage of time.

Will the same thing happen with the great red wines of
northern California? Evidence indicates that it will. Seek out a
1974 or 1978 Ridge Montebello or Heitz Martha's Vineyard
Cabernet Sauvignon—you will find it either unavailable or, if
you are lucky enough to find one, it will surely cost many times
the original price.

Experts are waxing poetic about the 1985 vintage of
Cabernets produced in California. Robert Parker praises 1985
as “the most exciting vintage for California cabernet sauvignon
and merlot in more than a decade... they are very
concentrated, rich, full-bodied, classically structured wines
with outstanding color, depth, and stunning bouquets of fully
ripe, sweet fruit.” Here is a vintage to buy and lay down.

It was not easy for us to persuade the proprietors of the

DVANCE

great vineyards listed here to part with some of their precious
1985s, so that we could offer them to our clientele. In some
instances, we were allocated fewer than |0 cases.

Every one of the wines on our list will develop beautifully
with age—and they are likely to be very scarce three years
hence, or considerably more costly. Our advice—buy your
choice of these magnificent California Cabernets now, before
our limited reserves disappear.

Delivery will take place during the months ahead as the
wines reach us.

DOMAINE MICHEL

Celebrates

Michael Aaron’s 30% Anniversary at Sherry-Lehmann

am Aaron, chairman of Sherry-Lehmann, was feted

in 1984 at Chateau Margaux on the occasion of his

50th anniversary at Sherry-Lehmann. This spring, the
magnificent Domaine Michel, one of the great new vineyards
of California, saluted Michael Aaron on the occasion of his
30th year at Sherry-Lehmann.

Among the luminaries of the California wine world who
attended the splendid dinner celebration were Andre
Tchelistcheff, Tom Jordan, Bernard Portet of Clos du
Val, Rodney Strong—and of course Jean-Jacques
Michel, the winery’s chairman chef and Philip Baxter, its
brilliant wine-maker.

The dinner was prepared by Lawrence Vito, famed
executive chef of the Stanford Court Hotel in San
Francisco. Here is the wonderful menu he created (served
after a Champagne reception, with Mandarin. Imperial
Caviar), which won enthusiastic plaudits from all of the
guests:

Oyster and Sea Urchin Chowder with Morels
Grilled Foie Gras
Abalone with Fettucine and Lobster Caviar

Roast Saddle of Venison with a Wild Blueberry
and Tart Red Cherry Sauce

Nutty Greens and Aged Goat Cheese
Pears Caprice
Teuscher Chocolates and Little Cookies

 

 

Jean-Jacques Michel and Philip Baxter with Christine and
Michael Aaron, discussing the gala dinner at Domaine
Michel with master chef Lawrence Vito.

 

Among the wines served were of course the superb Domaine
Michel Chardonnay 1985 and Domaine Michel Cabernet
Sauvignon 1984. We can think of no better dry white wine to
add a distinctive touch to your summer menus than this truly
excellent 1985 Chardonnay. The 1984 Cabernet Sauvignon
can be defined, without exaggeration, as one of the best red
wines produced in the Napa/Sonoma area. It is delicious
now—its life will be long—and our supply is limited. enough
to cover not only your summer and fall needs, but also a
sufficient supply to fill your cellar for the seasons ahead.

DOMAINE MICHEL 16.95 203.40
CHARDONNAY 1985. Light, graceful, crisp, fruity—
with a floral, fragrant lilt. All of this balanced bya
fundamental, subtle richness. Understated and delicate,
like a cru Meursault, yet with a lingering fuller flavor that
evokes memories of Montrachets. (679)

DOMAINE MICHEL CABERNET 19.95 239.40
SAUVIGNON 1984. This deep and complex wine,
with layers of classic blackberry, cassis, chocolate and anise
scents and flavors, is also distinctively lean. It will grow
even more impressive with age—a worthy candidate for
cellaring. Invites comparison to Chateau Latour. (4 37)
