“Pick a Piper” has become as much a part of the English language as “Catch 22” ‘‘Kleenex” or ‘‘Xerox.” Like those others, the
very name “Piper’”’ has become synonymous with a whole category of products—in this case, “Champagne.”

Perhaps this all got started when the founder of Piper-Heidsieck, Florens Louis, visited Marie Antoinette at the Petit
Trianon and persuaded her to switch to Piper-Heidsieck Champagne.

Piper-Heidsieck promises to be among the most festive of summer Champagnes. Its popularity and excellence is
undisputed. Its quality will please the most “persnickety” of Champagne drinkers.

shouted ‘Eureka!”’ Here were wines with depth,
fruit, roundness, good balance and complexity—
wines truly designed to please the aficionado.

The Domecg family’s wine-making history
in Spain goes back over 250 years, and they
are famed not only for their remarkable
dedication, but also for their skills in
pono some of the world’s finest wines,

randies and sherries.

Seeking new frontiers, the venerable House
of Domecq decided to go to the Rioja region
in search of the best vineyard land—land
ideally suited for making outstanding red
wine. Domecq’s wine-maker, Jose Ignacio, Jr.,
a self-proclaimed Bordeaux fan, journeyed to
the Rioja. Senor Ignacio, accompanied by his
father, who is affectionately known as “the
nose’”’ within the wine trade, found the ideal
land in the Alavesa vineyards of the Rioja.

 

Rioja balance and freshness.

After adding many sought-after and prom-
ising virieyards to their holdings, guided by an
impeccable team of euler headed by
Jose Ignacio, Jr. and Professor Emile Peynaud,
the legendary French oenologist, Domecq
created some of Spain’s most highly praised
wines. These wines bear the name of a
prominent family member, the Marques de
Arienzo.

The wines of the Marques de Arienzo have
delighted our clientele since we first
introduced them last year. When you taste
them we believe that you too will share our

reat enthusiasm for these complex, well-
Balgnced wines. Our advice—order the
