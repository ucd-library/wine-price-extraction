_ enthusiasts,” and the United States is the leader in
_ this phenomenon. The clamoring for better white
©. Burgundies grown along the Cote d’Or has created
scarce supplies and higher prices for such wines as Meursault,
Chablis, Chassagne-Montrachet and Puligny-Montrachet.
Higher costs for American importers are further compounded
bya drop in the value of the American dollar against the French franc.

Despite these economic conditions, we proudly and happily
report that our prices are similar to those of last year, and in
some instances they are even lower. We offer here the full
advantage of our early acquisition costs—our quotations are
not based on replacement costs. This opportunity will soon be
gone, sO we suggest—no, we urge—that you acquire your
1984, 1985 and 1986 white Burgundies now.

All the facts on this vintage are not yet in, but we do know that
some outstanding wines were made this year—particularly
the carefully selected Macon blancs from Georges Duboeuf.
The 1987 Pouilly-Fuisse, at the record low price of $9.95, will
astonish you with its excellence. Each one of the four wines
isted below won First Prize within its category at a competitive
blind tasting held in Macon.
