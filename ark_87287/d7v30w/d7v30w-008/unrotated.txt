GEORGES DUBOEUF 1987 PRIZE-WINNING FLOWER LABEL JK F
BEAUJOLAIS AND MACONNAIS WINES ARE HERE! 49

"rank Prial, wine critic of The New York Times, has high

| praise for the 1987 Beaujolais: “The 1987 Beaujolais is

not only the best in a number of years, but is perhaps

even better than the lovely ’85s, and may be the most
successful wine out of France this year.”

Mr. Prial reserves special accolades for the 1987 Beaujolais
of Georges Duboeuf:

“They [are] soft, deep-colored wines with a lingering

gamay flavor and, for young, relatively inexpensive wines,

an unforgettable bouquet.”

Georges Duboeuf talks about the 1987 vintage:

“| have never encountered Beaujolais wines as perfumed,
tender and delightfully drinkable.... With the same
fervor and passion as in years past, | have tasted my way
through hundreds of Beaujolais vineyards in order to
choose and select the best cuvees for you.

“1987 is truly an excellent Beaujolais year. It is one of
the most ‘typical’ vintages | have known, and it fully
corresponds to the way | like Beaujolais to taste—to my
image of Beaujolais Duboeuf.”

Sam Aaron, Chairman of Sherry-Lehmann, adds:

“| have been an avid purchaser of Beaujolais for over 50
years at Sherry-Lehmann (since 1934). During these five
decades | have never come across a vintage that matches
the 1987 for fruit, balance and sheer joy of drinking.”

Georges Duboeuf’s 1987 Flower Label Beaujolais and
Maconnais wines have all won first prize at the Villefranche or
Macon wine fair. Each bottle is beautifully adorned with the
“FLOWER LABEL,” expressing the fact that Georges Duboeuf
has chosen his best wines for this prestigious bottling.

These fruity, delicious Beaujolais and crisp, dry white wines
are all designed to bring much drinking pleasure—at modest
cost—to your summer entertaining.

For the more curious among you—try the 1|2-bottle
Duboeuf Summertime Sampler, containing one of each of the
twelve wines bearing an asterisk (*) listed here.
