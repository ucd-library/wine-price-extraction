 

   

n our Spring catalogue, when talking about French
Champagnes, we pointed out that economists predicted
a strong increase in the price of French Champagnes in
the latter part of 1988. Some prices have already gone up,
but we acquired enough inventory to protect our clientele at
least through the summer. Dom Perignon now costs us $100
more per case, and Perrier-Jouet costs $12 more. All this is a
result of the weakness of the American dollar against the
French franc.
Our advice is that you acquire your Champagnes during the
summer, in anticipation of your needs through the end of the
year.
