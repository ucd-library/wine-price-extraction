QO UR stay in Champagne was all

too short, though we did cover a
great deal of territory. There were
many things to remember . . . the show-
manship displayed in the Pommery
cellars . . . the interesting and enlight-
ening visit to Hautvilliers Abbey where
Dom Perignon is supposed to have dis-
covered the champagne process . . . the
incredible difference in tasting the press
from the grapes and the finished and
bottled Champagne... the utter mag-
nificence of the 1929 Bollinger Brut
which was offered us by Madame Bol-
linger when we visited her home and
cellars the delightful luncheon
offered in the home of Comte Bertrand
de Vogue by the Syndicate . . . and so
back to Paris with all of us in fine
condition and ready and willing for
more tasting.

HE nostalgia generated among
our older clients as they view

 

 

the moustache cups, theatre posters and
stock market quotations dating back
half century, now on view in our “Gay
Nineties” window . . . congratulations
to our Jack Aaron on his initiation into
the inner circles of the Confrerie de
Chevaliers du Tastevin during his re-
cent trip to France . . . those of you
who may have visited the Riviera are
familiar with the charming pink wines
of nearby Provence. One of the best,
Chateau de Saint-Martin 1945, will
reach our cellars by December Ist. At
$1.24 the bottle, it will surely be a best
seller more and more, the red
wines of the Rhone Valley are being
appreciated. Try the Chapoutier Cha-
teauneuf du Pape, Les Grandes Serres
1937 ($2.29) and you will agree ..

Alsace gives us the lightest of the pink
wines; the charming Vin Gris of
Domaine Dopff at $1.72 is well worth
trying ...a fresh supply of Croyden
1943 Champagne splits has just ar-
rived from France. Since they are only
$.98 each, you can add much gaiety to
your holiday entertaining without seri-

ously denting the budget . . . it sounds
unbelievable but it’s true! A topflight
Spanish Sherry, Encanto Amontillado
at only $1.29 the ,bottle . . . a tip—
choose your holiday red wines early
and let them rest before drinking ...

 

E can’t resist telling about this

one! Before November ends, we
will receive a small shipment of de-
lightful replicas of the Parisian kiosk.
Each one handpainted in France —
displaying the typical posters, Bal Tab-
arin, Maxim’s, etc.; each one holding
an exciting wild strawberry liqueur,
Dolfi Framberry from Alsace. Believe
us, you will find it irresistible for your
home*or as a Christmas Gift item.
(8.00 the bottle, including kiosk): A

word to the wise—reserve yours now.

NOTE: There is some poor wine made in the best of vintage years, and there is also some good wine made when the vintage is, generally speaking a failure. Hence one should pay
more attention to the quality of the wine in the bottle than to the vintage year.
