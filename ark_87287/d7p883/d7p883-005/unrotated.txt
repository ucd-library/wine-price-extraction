relative values as wines, but to taste
them accompanied with the foods which
they enhance or with dishes which are
chosen as suitable backgrounds for the
wines is quite another thing.

From Vouvray we journeyed on to
Saumur where we tasted some of the
truly great wines of that district, par-
ticularly a remarkably good vin rose de
Saumur which is made principally from
Cabernet grape. We were impressed by
the firm of Ackerman-Laurance whose
Dry Royal may be familiar to you. Its
proprietor Baron de Luze was leaving
the following day for his 72nd trip
across the Atlantic, which is, perhaps,
something of a record. On to Anjou
where we met M. Rossignol, whose
Anjou Rose is well known to many of
you.

 

Cognac

E headed Southwest and arrived
MW the little town of Cognac
where the world’s greatest brandies are
made. We enjoyed inspecting two of
the biggest distilleries in the district—
Martell and Hennessey. At dinner,
Mr. Hennessey stressed that America
drinks considerably less Cognac now
than before prohibition and startled us
with the that Venezuela
imports more Cognac than the entire
United States. Among the drinks we
tasted here Charente
which they are trying to popularize,

was Pineau de
but I found this mixture of Cognac
and wine a little sweet and undistin-
guished.

The World’s Wine Capitol

ORDEAUX, the Mecca of wine-
lovers, was next on our itinerary.

The first night three of us stole away
to the Chapon Fin for a little private
tasting of our own. The Chapon Fin

has been one of the best known restau-

rants in France for many years and

 

their cellar is one of the finest in the
world. The food, however, is no longer
what it was, but it was worth the trip
to linger over some of the great wines
one seldom finds on any other list. We
chose a 1934 Chateau Haut Simard
purely out of curiosity and were well
repaid; Chateau Ausone of 1928 and
1929, the Cheval Blanc of 1920, all of
noble stature. Then a magnum of Cha-
teau Margaux 1915 which was old and
tired, and appeared feeble after the
others. And finally an 1878 Armagnac,
climaxing an evening of wine tasting
that may come only once or twice in a
lifetime.

Bits From Bordeaux
ee a host of 1947 and 1948

wines from the cask, and 1945’s
from the bottle. Many Bordeaux grow-
ers look to their 1945’s, and I agree
with them, as the greatest vintage year
since 1929 for their red wines. A few
favor the 1947’s. There is little ques-
tion about the glory of the 1947 White
Bordeaux, with 1945 again appearing
the dry-
ness and delicacy of Chateau Haut
Brion Blanc 1947 was reminiscent of a
superb White Burgundy rather than
typical of Bordeaux . .

as its closest competition...

. we almost all
agreed that Chateau Margaux was one
of the best kept cellars we had yet
visited . . . the superb dinner given in
the great banquet hall of Chateau
Mouton Rothschild by Baron Philippe
de Rothschild in honor of our party.
We reverence the jera-
boams of Chateau Mouton Rothschild
1923 and the Imperiales of 1881, both
astoundingly great

beauty of Chateau Yquem and the su-

Southern France

UR first stop in the Rhone Valley

was the colorful town of Chateau-
neuf du Pape. Here, at the restaurant
“La Mule due Pape” we encountered
some of the best dining of our tour and
certainly the best we experienced in
Southern France. A superb Souffle
Grand Marnier (we cannot resist re-
peating the recipe below) was accom-
panied by a most unusual white wine,
Chateauneuf du Pape Blanc.

GRAND MARNIER SOUFFLE

Melt 4 tablespoons butter, add 2
tablespoons flour, and cook until the
mixture starts to color. Gradually add
1 cup rich hot milk, stirring constantly,
and cook for about 5 minutes. Stir in 4
egg yolks, beaten with 4 tablespoons
sugar and 4 cup Grand Marnier. Cool
and then fold in the stiffly beaten whites
of 6 eggs. Pour mixture into buttered
souffle dish and bake in a moderate
oven 350° F. for 45 minutes. Serve
immediately.

And then a sentimental journey to
the vineyards of Clos de Chante
Aloutte, which has long been one of
my favorite wines (there is still some
of the 1937 remaining in Sherry’s cel-
lar) ... lunch with M. Chapoutier, a
wine grower of high integrity, which
was made memorable by one of his
wines, Hermitage Rouge, Clos de Sizer-
anne 1929,
