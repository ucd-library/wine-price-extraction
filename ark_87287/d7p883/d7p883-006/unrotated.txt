Restaurant De La Pyramide, Monsieur
Point served us what is probably the
finest Beaujolais I have ever had and
it was chilled—I asked several of
the men we visited in Beaujolais and
found some agreeing, others that it
should be served at cellar temperature
—which is around 55 degrees . . . the
horror of drinking a warm sparkling
wine from the Beaujolais district at
nine in the morning at a Chamber of
Commerce reception.

W orld’s Greatest Vineyards

HE beautiful ride from Macon

to Beaune and the great joy of
seeing the famous vineyards the
wonder that such small plots of ground
can produce such magnificence in quan-
tities large enough to provide us with
the needed amount of the great wines
the world desires . . . the glories of the
landscape with the rolling hills and the
almost geometric patterns that rows of
vines create—the legendary old world
quality of Beaune . . . the surprise to
find the 47 wines as brilliant and drink-
able as they are, even some of the reds
are utterly delicious at this point and
the whites seem completely mature.
The magnificence of the great Hospice
de Beaune, which is still used as a
hospital and which retains much of its
original medieval woodwork and many
of the original appointments. A visit to
the cellars of the Hospice where the
‘49 were being brought in... The
elegance of Burgundian food .. . The
delicacy of the Meursault—Genevrieres
1946 and the grandeur of a 1929 De-
moiselle — Montrachet. The latter
served with a brochette baked in puff
paste. At the same dinner a really
majestic Nuits St. Georges “Chateau
Gris,” 19290 served with a perfectly
roasted pheasant . . . the fun of com-
paring a Batard-Montrachet of 1947
vintage with .a Grand-Montrachet of
1904, which was in many ways the
most remarkable wine we tasted . .
a visit to Romanee-Conti and a bit of
sadness when | thought that there
would be none of this glorious wine for
a number of years, since the vineyard
was replanted after the 1945 harvest
the historic old press at Clos
Vougeot and the almost hallowed at-
mosphere at the same place... Dijon.
