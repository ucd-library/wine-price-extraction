The 1964 Red Burgundies, among the best and most enjoyable
of our time, have been resting in our cellars now for over two
years. Sufficient bottle-age has been acquired so that even a
modestly qualified wine lover can appraise the year and recog-
nize its virtues.

It became quite apparent after the fifth 1964 had been tasted—
they are rich in fruit, well-balanced, enjoyable today and
endowed with sufficient depth and staying power to indicate
quite clearly that there still remains a good number of good,
glorious and satisfying years ahead. Drink them today—or lay
them away for the future, whichever you do, you will be making
no mistake. If good Red Burgundy is your preference, 1964 is
not a year to be overlooked.

SALE PRICE
No. Bottle Case
329 BOURGOGNE ROUGE, Nicolas . 1.99 21.50

What this country needs is not “‘a good five-cent cigar”, but a good bottle of Burgundy
at $2.00. Here it is. You can drink it day-in and day-out, not worry too much about the
expense, and you would be drinking typical wine of the Cote d’Or.

668 PINOT NOIR DE MARSANNAY,
Clair Dau... <= 2a 26.90

Made of the noble Pinot Noir grape that has flourished in some of the best soil of
Burgundy, not too far south from Dijon.

571 COTE DE BEAUNE VILLAGES,
Tae Se a ee 26.90

The appellation ‘Cote de Beaune Villages’? means that it is wine of the Cote de Beaune
from a township other than Beaune itself. Here is an excellent Burgundy of the middle
group that gives you good wine at modest cost.

362 CHASSAGNE MONTRACHET,
mene | 2 32.30

There are about 400 acres under red wine cultivation in the entire town, an area more
famous for its whites. Don’t overlook the reds. Frank Schoonmaker says, “‘there are
always good and sometimes remarkable.”

250 SANTENAY, ClairDau ... . 3.49 37.70

Southernmost village of the Cote d’Or. Quite soft with a “‘goutte de terroir’ or a
pleasant, earthy taste. Excellent future here.

244 MONTHELIE, Potinet-Ampeau . . 3.49 37.70

Tiny village back of Volnay; among the best of the lessor-known Burgundies.

338 ALOXE CORTON,
Chandon de Brailles .... . 3.69 39.85

Excellent breed and finesse. From an impeccable producer. Exceptional class.

509 FIXIN CLOS NAPOLEON, Gelin . 3.79 40.95

Northernmost village of the Cote de Nuits. Comparable in quality to the better Gevrey
Chambertins.

224 BEAUNE CENT VIGNES, Duchet . 3.79 40.95

The better vintages of Beaune are characterized by softness and are notable for finesse
and aroma. They are relatively quick to mature. Here is a true glory produced in the
happy vintage year of 1964.

308 MOREY ST. DENIS, CLOS BUSSIERE,
Roumier .. . tee aoe 43.10

Firm, sturdy and long-lived. It has the kind of depth of flavor associated with Cham-
bertin itself, but at about half the price.

315 VOSNE ROMANEE, J.Grivot . . 3.99 43.10

Jean Grivot is one of the most attractive and most intelligent of the younger generation
of vignerons. Though the wine only bears the name of the village and not a great
vineyard name, this delicate, well-balanced 1964 is really a wine of remarkable class.

No. Bottle Case
285 GEVREY CHAMBERTIN, Tortochot 3.99 43.10

We have had literally dozens of people asking us for Tortochot’s Chambertin because
they claim it is the best Red Burgundy they have ever tasted. Here, Tortochot did not
plough the famed Chambertin vineyard, but a vineyard only a 3-minute walk away.
It has much of the class at a fraction of the price.

259 CHAMBOLLE MUSIGNY, Cambola 3.99 43.10

Celebrated wine-producing township. Here is a superb example, nourished with loving
care by the Mayor of the town, Alain Roumier.

276 POMMARD, de Courcel . . . . 449 48.50

Much of the wine that bears the easy-to-remember name of Pommard must be delicious,
since ten times as much is sold around the world than is produced. We are dealing here
with a genuine, estate-bottled example of great class and the well-balanced qualities
associated with superb Pommard.

5003 ECHEZEAUX, Mugneret. . . . 449 48.50

This is not a “‘sneeze” but the name of a wine. 6,000 cases are produced here a year—a
wine more noted for its finesse than its strength.

440 CHAMBOLLE MUSIGNY, LES
CHARMES,Cambola . . . . . 449 48.50

From one of the best vineyards of the famed township—Les Charmes. A true thorough-
bred. Alain Roumier, the grower, is deservedly proud of it.

759 POMMARD RUGIENS, Lejeune . 4.79 51.75

There are two great vineyards in Pommard and “‘Rugiens”’ is one of them. It is soft
and beautifully balanced, superb fruit, and a fantastic amount of finesse.

209 VOLNAY CHAMPANS,
Marquis d’Angerville . . . . . 4.79 51.75

We shall never forget our visit to the friendly home of Marquis d’Angerville and his
charming wife. This was the very wine that was served us at dinner and we were
intrigued by its velvety qualities, perfumed bouquet and distinguished individuality.

228 NUITS ST. GEORGES, VAUCRAINS,
H Gouges . 0. ke SON ee ee

Excellent wines are produced in this township, especially at a top flight vineyard such
as “‘Vaucrains’’. Look for the softness and balance and the earthy flavor that has earned
it its world fame.

394 CLOS VOUGEOT, Pierre Poupon . 5.99 64.70

The largest vineyard in Burgundy! 124 acres and 65 owners! The picturesque chateau
and ancient wine press are located amidst the vines. They are now the property of the
famed Burgundian wine fraternity, the Chevaliers du Tastevin.

5004 GRANDS ECHEZEAUX, Mugneret 5.99 64.70

Don’t confuse this with ‘‘Echezeaux’’. It is a much smaller vineyard lying just above
Clos de Vougeot. Much more distinguished than those just simply called ‘‘Echezeaux’’.

1070 CORTON RENARDES,
Prince de Merode . ... . . 6.59 71.15

We recently had a tasting of 10 different Burgundies, all $6.00 the bottle or more.
It was a blind tasting. The 8 wine professionals voted this the best. We agree.

400 CHAMBERTIN, Tortochot . . . 6.79 74,75

Chambertin is always extremely expensive and when good, deserves the price. Extreme
power, great longevity, extraordinary class. It was the favorite of Napoleon and
Alexandre Dumas who liked contemplating life through a “‘glass of Chambertin’’.

409 LA TACHE, Domaine de la Romanee
Cont Ca ce; Pe IST) 160.50

Only 15 precious acres! Many consider this the greatest single red wine produced in
France, and we are the last to argue the point. Very rare, irreplacable. Buy now—or
*‘forever hold your peace’’, for soon 64 La Tache will be but a fond memory.
