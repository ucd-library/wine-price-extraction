RED WINES FROM THE RHONE VALLEY—continued Hotds Geko

845 CHATEAUNEUF DU PAPE, DES FINES ROCHES, 1961 .......... 2.79 30.15

The popular, sturdy red wine of the Rhone grown about 10 miles north of the old Papal city of
Avignon. From a superb vineyard on a high plateau dominating the valley. Crimson in color, full-
bodied without dullness, soft. Ready now.

623 COTE ROTIE 1964 (Bruno Thierry) ....................ccccecceee 2.99 32.30

Color rich, hint of violet in the bouquet, distinguished estate-bottled heritage. Pleasantly located
on a dramatic high hill between the La Pyramide restaurant at Vienne and a much sought-after
tiny vineyard of Chateau Grillet. What a location from whence to eat and drink!

471 HERMITAGE DES MOINES 1964 (Chierpe) ..................005. 3.99 43.10

Produced at a tiny vineyard (only 300 cases in all) on a steep spectacular terraced hillside 50 miles
south of Lyon. The vineyard is almost pure rock and faces due South. A deep-colored red wine, very
long-lived, fine and capable of competing with even the greatest glories of Burgundy.

WHITE WINES FROM THE RHONE VALLEY...

597 CONDRIEU, CHATEAU DU ROZAY, 1964.........05...cccccecces 4.99 53.90
Almost all of this unusual white wine is consumed in local restaurants, particularly the famous
Restaurant de la Pyramide where it is featured. Fairly dry, robust, and perfumed, sometimes slightly
petillant, a trace of gold in the color, fruity and with a distinctive bouquet.

441 CHATEAU GRILLET (RHONE) 1966 ..............cccccccccccees 13.69 147.93
The rarest wine in France. Total production is only 180 cases per year. We doubt whether 10 cases
have reached the United States since Repeal. Owned by the Gachet family, the wine is as extra-
ordinary as it is rare—full-bodied, golden, dry, relatively high in alcohol and endowed with its own
individual bouquet and flavor—like no other wine. The wine will not reach us until the end of June
so please order now to make certain you will get your share.
