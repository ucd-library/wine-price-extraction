455 PINOT CHARDONNAY .. 1.59 17.15

Estate Bottled, Lamartine

Made from the same grape as used in the famous white Burgundies, this wine possesses
the same unmistakeable flavor and dry finish but not the fullness of its more expensive
neighbors. A wine that needs no occasion, at a price that needs no second thought.

For generations, the Plumet family have never left their charming road in the town of
Fuissé that dominates the vineyards below. Here is the best of the vineyards, estate-

bottled by the most traditional of the vignerons. We can only say ‘‘superb”’.

319 CHASSAGNE-MONTRACHET 3.49 37.70

Estate Bottled, Ramonet-Prudhon

Even a village wine in the hands of the Ramonet family becomes a thing of beauty.
We have visited the Ramonets often and we can only say that no one in Burgundy
matches their white wine skill. It was not by accident that the Hospices de Beaune
have selected them to care for their white wines for the annual auction.

Estate Bottled, P. Matrot

In the town of Puligny, everyone makes wine—the Mayor, the village priest, the area
doctor and the local lawyer. They all say Mr. Matrot is the master. The evidence
provided by this wine indicates clearly that the local gentry are of sound wine

judement.
601 MEURSAULT PERRIERES 4.29 46.35
This is not just Meursault—but “‘Perrieres”’! Its 42 acres are considered the supreme

A small portion of the Clos Vougect vineyard, famous for its red wines, is dedicated

Burgundies

To find what are considered the great-
est dry wines of the world, one must
look to Burgundy. We herald enthusi-
astically the great ’66s—wines of fan-
tastic breed, airy lightness, and extra-
ordinary bouquet. We also appreciate
the fine, fruity, full-bodied quality of
the very successful ’64s. As for the ’62s,
we can only applaud, and loudly. Here
are superb, dry whites that are genuinely
ready for present drinking—not for
laying down—the ’62s, if good, can be
dramatically fine, rich in every quality.
The °65s and ’63s can be ignored, and

rightly so.

779 BOURGOGNE ALIGOTE. . 1.79 19.35

Estate Bottled, Jos. Matrot
Very agreeable, dry white wine produced from the Aligote grape. France drinks over
a million gallons a year. This is the very wine that is recommended to be mixed with a
bit of Cassis to make the famous “vin blanc Cassis” or “‘Kir’’.

This is a Premier Cru Chablis from the highly regarded Forét vineyard. A wine of

There is a hamlet in the southwest corner of Meursault called Blagny. It is wine from

this tiny area of Meursault that becomes ready for drinking in 2 years and often can

This vineyard covers only about 9 acres and it is almost identical in characteristics to
Batard Montrachet. Look for bigness, richness, flowery bouquet and a pleasing dryness.

565 BATARD MONTRACHET . 5.99 64.70
Estate Bottled, M. Niellon

In its characteristics, Batard Montrachet resembles the famed le Montrachet. Dry, yet
rounded; with great elegance and breed and a haunting bouquet.

340 CHABLIS GRAND CRU,

Estate Bottled, Nicolas

From one of the eight tiny vineyards of Chablis that have won the classification
“Grand Cru”. This superb example is dry, pale-straw color, clean and fine, and with

a most delicate bouquet.
767 MEURSAULT CHARMES . 3.49 37.70
The only reason that there is not universal acclaim that the best of Meursault belongs

Estate Bottled, Matrot
to Matrot is that these superb wines are produced in quantities too limited to be
generally available, and thus not sufficiently publicized.

774 PULIGNY-MONTRACHET,

COMBETTES  . *. 2 ire GAB 37.70
Estate Bottled, Sauzet

“Les Combettes”, the best of the first growth vineyards of Puligny Montrachet,
occupies 16 splendid acres that yield less than 2,000 cases per annum. It is hard to
come by, it is truly in the big leagues, and will satisfy the discriminating connoisseur
who does not want to pay over $10.00 the bottle for Montrachet.

757 CORTON CHARLEMAGNE. 4.99
When Corton Charlemagne is good, it is in a class with the illustrious Montrachct.

Estate Bottled, Nicolas

Great breed, and steeier than most white Burgundies. The slopes are the steepest in
Burgundy and must be tended by hand since horses and oxen cannot climb here.
Remarkable, scarce and excellent.

081 BIENVENUE BATARD

MONTRACHET. ...... 5.99 64.70
Estate Bottled, Ramonet

Here is a great wine that has enjoyed 4 years in bottle to bring it to its ultimate
maturization—the kind of great white Burgundy everybody talks about but few ever
experience. It is the greatness of the 1962 vintage and the initial superiority of this
wine that have combined to make this the masterpiece that it surely is.
