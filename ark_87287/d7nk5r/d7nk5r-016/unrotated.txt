1959

Scarce, Great - Perfection for Present Drinking

Our associate, Sam Aaron, has just returned from his Spring vineyard tour of Burgundy. He reports the following, “Armed
with a fist full of money, and even if the wine buyer ignored price as a factor, it is questionable whether he could f. ind,

se aoe after grower, 200 cases of genuine, truly fine red 1959 Burgundy among all of the reputable growers of the
ote rr’.

The effect of the title “Vintage of the Century” which has been bestowed on the °59s, has created enough buying pressure
to denude the cellars, despite the large crop. Most were soundly made, are perfect today and display great charm and
delicacy. If you want to drink great red Burgundy, vibrantly alive with fruit and charm, drink these for the next few

years—and you will match wine pleasure of a previous generation, who were equally lucky with the 1934s—a vintage
similar in its character.

The better vineyards of Beaune are characterized by softness and lightness, noted for finesse and aroma, and are relatively quick to
mature. Here is perhaps the best single vineyard of this famed wine-producing town and is a true glory in 1959.

Here again, we are dealing with a great Burgundy that was cared for throughout its life by M. Trinquet, the most respected wine-maker
of Burgundy a reputation which he has earned by virtue of heading the School of Oenology of Beaune for over 30 years. This wine
proudly bears the numbered label of the Confrerie des Chevaliers du Tastevin and the enthusiastic approval of the “Tastevin’’ Tasting
Committee. Only 40 cases in existence.

Some wine-writers have suggested that the wines of ‘“Grands Echezeaux”’ have never commanded the price and the acclaim of neighbouring

vineyards which are no better largely because the name is difficult to pronounce and remember. Learn how to pronounce it, it’s easy
(Esh-shay-zo); drink great wine and simultaneously save money.

We quote from the notes of M. Trinquet, the man who cared for this wine, “Robe of garnet, beautiful perfumed bouquet. A truly great
wine capable of rivalling even a fine Chambertin. Approved by the Chevaliers du Tastevin.”’

Here again, we quote from the tasting notes of M. Trinquet, the retired Dean of the Vinicultural School of Beaune, “Delicate perfume

This vineyard, whose name means “‘the good acres”’, is a tete du cuvée‘””’, or first growth, of Chambolle-Musigny. Not as well known as
its adjoining neighbor, Le Musigny, it commands a price well below its true value—one of the noblest vineyards of all Burgundy.

What neighbors! Richebourg is bounded on the south by Romanée-Conti and the east by Romanée St. Vivant. Less than 2,000 cases

are produced per year; generally it is fuller, deeper in color and “‘bigger” than its adjoining vineyards in the town of Vosne-Romanée.
Most of this vineyard is owned by the Domaine de la Romanée-Conti.

Adjoins Romanée-Conti and Richebourg. Only 23 acres in size, most of the yield being vinified by Joseph Drouhin. Here is one of the
best ones we have tasted, truly full, remarkable bouquet, great finesse, and capable of competing and holding its own with any red Burgundy
you have ever tasted.
