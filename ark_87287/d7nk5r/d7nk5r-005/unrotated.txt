FRANCE AND ENGLAND
REVISITED

Ir is now May 18th and we are sitting in
our London Hotel room dictating our last
minute impressions as we go to press
awaiting the departure of Pan Am Flight
001 back to New York.

We want this report to reflect every
discovery so that we can be as helpful as
we can in making your summer living and
fall wine planning as easy as possible.

We once again revisited Bordeaux and
stayed at our beloved Chateau Haut Brion
where great wines and magnificent food
were served in the pleasant company of
the Wellers and the Delmases. While there,
we discovered the beautifully balanced
claret of finesse and depth that exhibits
great class at a price that fits into the
budget of any discriminating wine lover.
It is called “‘Chateau Bahans Haut Brion”.
What is it? —why the name?

Every drop is produced from the noble
vines of Chateau Haut Brion and bottled
at the Chateau. It does not bear a vintage
simply because it is a judicious blending
of the light ’63s and the fuller fruitier ’62s.
The noble heritage of Chateau Haut Brion
is reflected in the wine. It is not an ordinary
red—it is good enough to be served at
dinner with the meat at the Chateau itself.
Here is an opportunity for you to get all
of the class, the character and the
excellence of a superior claret for only
$4.49 the bottle and $48.50 the case.

The first shipment—a small one—will
reach us by early July. If you are interested
in what is in the bottle and not in a
socially acceptable date that may appear
on the label, we urge you to acquire
Chateau Bahans Haut Brion.

We also revisited Chateau Greysac and
confirmed our earlier impression of the
qualities of its 64s.

One of the outstanding discoveries of
our Bordeaux jaunt was our visit to
Chateau Pichon Longueville Lalande
where we found the well-guarded private
cellar of great old vintages that have been
preserved under the most ideal conditions
by the Chateau’s Proprietor, M. Miaihle.
Tasting these wines was like a journey
through history. We started with the ’20s
and included every good year up to 1966.

A small sample of this extraordinary
library will reach the cellars of Sherry’s by
September and the list of the years and
prices should be in our possession by mid-
June. If you are interested in acquiring
any part of this collection (and the price
will not be prohibitive) please write us
and we will send you the list promptly
so that you can have “‘first choice’. Inci-
dentally M. Miaihle, and his charming
and remarkably beautiful wife Brigette,
met us again in Paris where, at the
Tour D’Argent they arranged for us to
dine in the distinguished company of
Chateau Pichon Longueville Lalande 1928
and Chateau Palmer 1952, another super
vineyard in which M. Miaihle holds an
important interest.

Under the inspired guidance of Lord
Cowdray and David Pollock, the pro-

Page 6

prietors of Chateau Latour, the vine-
yard has flourished dramatically during
the last few years. The plantings represent
perfection; the fermenting vats are the
envy of the vignerons and the care and
vinification are of the highest possible
level.

Obviously, Chateau Latour ’61, *62,
°64 and ’66 are among the greats and
will outlive most of us. However, what
amazed us particularly was the extra-
ordinary fullness of body, depth of flavor,
rich bouquet and the balance achieved
by a year that is usually overlooked by
the wine buyer. We are talking of the 63
vintage at Chateau Latour. The price is
pleasant enough; it is only $4.49 the bottle
and $48.50 the case. It will pass in most
beautiful fashion the test of “goodness
within the bottle and not just on the label’

We again met David Pollock and his
gracious wife in London at the Maison
Prunier and ate splendidly prepared
food accompanied by Chateau Latour
1955. It fascinated our companion Howard
Sloan to hear Mr. Pollock state that
“among the many ventures in which I
have been engaged in my long lifetime,
the most satisfying of them all has been
my presidency of Chateau Latour. Should
I retire, I may relinquish some of my
various directorships but I hope I will
never give up, regardless of my age,
my active participation in the manage-
ment of Chateau Latour”’.

Just as baseball teams have their scouts
to obtain the best possible players, we have
Gerald Asher to seek out the “rare and
lesser known wines of Europe’. One of
his best players for the coming season—
we think a new Ted Williams—will be
born in a red wine discovery in the
Rhone Valley, a vin d’une nuit. At the
**Foire aux Vins” in Orange it was unani-
mously awarded a Gold Medal in its class.
It is a light red wine grown on the slopes
of Mount Ventoux, mouth-filling with an
astonishing smell and flavor of fresh
crushed raspberries.

A vin d’une nuit is made as follows:
the grape juice and skins are left together
for only a short time (theoretically one
night—hence the name) and fermentation
then continues without the skins. This
gives a soft, light red colour to the wine,
a very tender frame and an early life.
Since most of us are now living for the
present we recommend this as a “now”?
wine. Enjoy it between now and Christmas.
It is of 1967 vintage and believe it or not,
the cost is only $1.79 a bottle, $19.35 the
case. The wine will reach us in time for the
July 4th festivities but please order it now
to avoid depletion risk.

Until fairly recently, wine represented a
communion between a warming liquid in
a clear glass and the thirsty palate of an
enthusiastic wine drinker. The next phase
was represented by a torrent of literature
on wine that varied from brief articles in
newspaper and magazine, to vast encyclo-
pedias, the most recent one being Alexis
Lichine’s Encyclopedia of Wine. But Mr.
Lichine was not content with the written
word—he moved on to a two record album
with delightful musical background, that
holds the attention of the wine listener for
almost two hours. On the disc called
Alexis Lichine’s ‘““The Joy of Wine’’, just

issued by MGM, you will hear the well
informed voices of Baron Philippe de
Rothschild; our associate, James Beard;
the Duke of Bedford; Prince von Metter-
nich; Claude Taittinger; Dr. Maynard
Amerine of the University of California;
Comte de Vogue of Moet & Chandon; and
Dorothy Rodgers who talk about home
entertainment. We have heard the record
—we liked it because each authority has
something to say. If you are interested in
wine, we know you will be delighted with
the sound track, the accompanying maps,
vintage charts and photographs. No better
record to listen to with a glass of good
claret in hand.

While in France we learned that Mr.
Dassault, a member of the French Parlia-
ment, is also the world-famous plane
builder who has created the Mirage, the
Mystére 20 (known in the U.S. as the
Falcon Jet). Among his many activities is
the proud ownership of Chateau Dassault,
one of the better vineyards of St. Emilion.
We have tasted his 1964 and found it out-
standing. The first shipment will reach our
cellars during late July and will be avail-
able at $2.99 the bottle; $32.30 the case.
If you like round, full, and fruity St.
Emilion, don’t overlook this thoroughbred.

We will have early reports on the 1968
vintage prospects this summer and we do
not want to lose touch with you. Should
you be gone during this period whether
it be to the Hamptons, the Adirondacks,
or wherever your favorite summer haunt
is, please mail us your country address.
We promise to send you news from the
vineyards while you bask in the sun, be it
mountain top, or a quiet beach.

Incidentally, we can deliver your
favorite wines and _ spirits promptly
anywhere in New York State from the tip
of Long Island right up to the Canadian
border. We think we can not only provide
a wider choice of fine wines and spirits but
better selections and simultaneously save
you money and care in your summer
entertaining.

To a gay and festive

Summer....
