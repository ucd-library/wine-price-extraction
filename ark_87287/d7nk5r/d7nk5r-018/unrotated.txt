We quote from Sherry’s vintage chart—‘‘sandwiched

1960 «’63
between two great years, the 1960 vintage has
suffered from being unfashionable. In fact, the °60s
a : e a. are better than average wines. The early heat caused
an excellent flowering and the promise of a big crop.

This promise was fulfilled—but later rains washed
away some of the hopes. The ’60s are very attractive
for current consumption—soft wines with a pro-
nounced bouquet—among the best values in good
claret on the market today’’.

The 1963 vintage was a complete disaster in St.
Emilion and Pomerol. However, because of more
favorable weather, the best ’63s can be found in the
Graves area, particularly at Haut Brion and La
Mission Haut Brion. On the Medoc, where some
really satisfactory wines were produced, far and away
the best were Chateau Latour and Lafite.

 

 

CLARETS OF THE 1960 VINTAGE SALE PRICE

No. Bottle Case

277 CHATEAU LATOUR ST. EMILION (St. Emilion) . . . . . . . . 249 26.90

A good, honest, fruity, light St. Emilion.

493 CHATEAU CALON SEGUR (St. Estephe) (2 39 3s6e
Normally the heaviest of clarets—a particular balance was struck here because of the relative lightness of the year ‘ resulting from the weather.

479 CHATEAU COS D‘ESTOURNEL (St. Estephe) .. es 3.29 35.55
Another example of when St. Estephe can sometimes reach its height in a bee than average year rather than i ina e great year. Ready now.

136 CHATEAU LA MISSION HAUT BRION (Graves). . : 5.49 59.30

We recently visited the Woltner Freres, proprietors of this glorious vineyard. They proudly served us their 1960. We were delighted—and so will your guests and
you be should you acquire it.

134 CHATEAU CHEVAL BLANC (St. Emilion) . . . . 849 $9.30

We live in an age where the acquisition of a first growth such as Cheval Blanc at $5.49 is no eninacy event. Here : you a are drinking wine of true distinction at a
price that does not make too deep a dent in the family budget.

187 CHATEAU LAFITE ROTHSCHILD (Pauillac) .. . $99 64.70

The 1961 Lafite is $19.95 and the 1959 fetches $24.50. As value, this 1960 at $5.99 is not simply “good _—it i is “sensational”.

CLARETS OF THE 1963 VINTAGE

258 CHATEAU DUCRU. BEAUCAILLOU (St. Julien) 2... 2.49 26.90
A “sleeper”. Don’t make the mistake of ignoring a really fine wine because of the year.
168 CHATEAU LATOUR HAUT BRION (Graves)... es 2.99 32.30

This wine is actually produced adjacent to the Chateau La Mission vineyard and is the less publicized ‘of the two wines produced here—only 1,000 cases are
made each year. Remarkable “‘finesse and elegance’’.

698 CHATEAU LA MISSION HAUT BRION (Graves). . oe. 3.49 37.70
Remember, the weather in Graves was relatively good in 1963. This velvety, generous and noble wine proves it clearly to any discriminating palate.
5035 CHATEAU LAFITE ROTHSCHILD (Pauillac) . . . . . 449 48.50

ape breed, considerable fruit and relatively light, lacking the authority of the great years. " Nevertheless, at this price, it is a wine that should hardly be
ignore

634 CHATEAU LATOUR (Pauillac) . - . . . 449 48.50

The most robust and sturdiest of clarets, deep-colored, slow to mature. Because of these characteristics, a light year such as 1963 is not a failure, as it is mostly
elsewhere, but a relative success.

229 CHATEAU HAUT BRION (Grayesy  .. . 499 53.90

We spent four days at Chateau Haut Brion and got to know the wines well. Here we are not dealing with the greatness of’ 61, 59 or ’64 but with a most acceptable
claret, still in the big leagues. Beyond question, the best example of 1963 produced in all of Bordeaux.
