finally won
RECOGNITION

Quietly, and with the minimum of publicity,
the perfect 1962 Clarets have finally won
deserved recognition among the world’s wine-
lovers. They never enjoyed the drum-beating
and frenzied publicity of the °59s, *61s, or
64s. But in their own way, like a Cinderella
tale, like the ugly duckling turned swan, they
have something to offer us. For 1962, in
Bordeaux, is the kind of wine that knowledge-
able amateurs and professionals would never
overlook in stocking their cellars.

The evidence is now clear; the ’62 Clarets are
early-maturing, evidently excellent, and pos-
sibly the equal of the ’55s in quality. We can
expect to enjoy them immediately because of
their fruit and balance. The prices will
surely go up, and substantially, before the
snows of next winter descend on us. Our
advice is simple—by all means acquire them
