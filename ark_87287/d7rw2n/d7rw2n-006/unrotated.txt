bad (it isn’t), but because this sort of
wine is cheap, goes well with food, is
cheering and pleasant and hardly more
intoxicating than beer; they like it.
They like it so much that FKrance imports
more wine than she exports. consumes

even more wine than her own three

But you don’t have to be great or
rich or famous to enjoy French wines,
or to know them. Few hobbies are as
rewarding as wine collecting, even on
a modest scale; and, if you are going
abroad, there are few pleasanter ways
of spending a week in France than ona
leisurely detour through the wine
country.

Taste (and I can mention here only
the most obvious examples) the wine
from that famous Burgundian vineyard
(Clos de Vougeot) which units of the
French army always salute when they
pass by on the National Road: the
wine from those narrow acres (Corton
Charlemagne) which the Emperor
Charlemagne gave to the Abbey of
Saulieu as an endowment nearly twelve
centuries ago; the wines from what
were the Popes’ own vineyards
(Chateauneuf-du-Pape), when the
Popes were installed at Avignon instead
of Rome. Try, too, the fabulous claret
of Lafite-Rothschild which, in certain
vintages, has been known to last and
even improve for over a hundred years
in bottle; and, of course, Champagne,
of which the old monk said when he
first tasted it, “‘I am drinking stars.”

It is absurd to imagine that all
Frenchmen have an expert’s knowledge
of wine merely because they are
French: no one was ever given a palate
with his passport. But if those who rank
as experts in France rarely know much
about the wines of Ucher countries, they
do know their own wines and we may
follow their findings with confidence.

It is, therefore, a matter of general
agreement that the great wine districts
of France are Bordeaux, Burgundy,
Champagne; that a few great wines are
also sometimes produced in the Rhone
Valley, in Anjou, possibly in Alsace,
rarely and occasionally in other dis-
tricts; and that little-known local wines
are almost always interesting and fun
to taste.

How, then, does one go about defin-

ing a great wine, or a great wine dIs-
trict. or a great year? Obviously these

terms are relative. Just what degree of

We, at SHERRY’S, present this stimulating reprint
Irom a recent issue of the cosmopolitan HOLIDAY
magazine in the belief that it is the responsibility of tl

all that he can to further the art of zo0od living.

periority is obvious: the moment you
taste it you are surprised, as if you had
never realized until now how good a
wine could be. But like a great novel o
a great painting or a great man, it is a
little baffling: it is clearly what it is, yet
you don’t know why.
