COGNAC DISCOVERIES

COL COURBE V.5.E.P. (In Crooked Neck Bottle) Era aes RP oe a eo ee ee

Col Courbé, in its interesting crooked neck bottle, is a fine brandy proudly bottled_in the
Cognac district, with the delicacy and aromatic bouquet associated with well made Cognac.

SINGLE CASK UNBLENDED COGNAC (Of the 1929 Vintage) .........--+-++-455

Here is an Estate-bottled Cognac that was produced during a great vintage year (1929) in
the most celebrated part of the Cognac country, “Grand Fine Champagne . It has remained
in its unblended state in barrels from 1929 until the present date. Cognac of this calibre is
difficult to obtain because no more than a few small growers have the patience and aptitude
to put aside, year after year, a distillation of their outstanding vintages.

HINE FAMILY RESERVE (Most remarkable Cognac of Peek ee oa rg as

Since the early 19th Century it has been the custom of the Hine Family to set aside the best
Cognac produced during a particularly outstanding year for their own future use — ultimately
this old precious reserve is served to honored guests on special occasions. For the first time,
Francois Hine, managing director of this venerable firm, has consented to part with a few of
these treasured bottles ~ each is numbered and bears a back label relating the unique history
of the contents, hand-signed by a Hine director.
