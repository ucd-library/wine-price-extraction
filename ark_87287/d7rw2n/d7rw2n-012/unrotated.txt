The wines of St. Emilion, because of their depth of flavor, are frequently referred to as the
“Burgundies of Bordeaux” — the most familiar example is Cheval Blanc. Here is a lesser known
Chateau with the richness and flavor associated with the great St. Emilions. An astonishing value.

a price as low as this. Normally commands over $50. We suggest early acquisition.

CHATEAU MARGADX 1047 (Margaux io cco a eo ee ee
