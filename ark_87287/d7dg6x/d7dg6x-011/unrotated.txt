Wines” by Frank Schoonmaker: ‘““cBEAUJOLAIS—(Bo-
sho-lay)—One of the most popular and best loved wines
of France, nearly always red (an insignificant amount of
rose and white is produced and legally entitled to the
name); also the district from which it comes, in southern
Burgundy, just north of Lyon. The vineyards make up a
rather small, compact area of vine-covered hills west of
the main Paris-Lyon-Riviera railway line and road. Only
a few Beaujolais wines may legally be labeled ‘‘Bour-
gogne’ ' (Burgundy)— —these are admittedly the best; they
come from nine specific villages or vineyard slopes;
Brouilly, Cote-de-Brouilly, Chenas, Chiroubles, Fleurie,
Julienas, Morgon, Moulin-a-Vent, St. Amour. Any of

these names on a bottle of Beaujolais is an indication,
almost a guarantee, of superior quality; few such wines
are ever sold as ‘‘Burgundy” or “Bourgogne,” even
though entitled to the name, being more saleable and
worth more under the appellation of their village of
origin. Ordinary Beaujolais is a light, agreeable, fruity,
eminently drinkable red table wine; it is usually served
at the temperature of the cellar rather than that of the
dining room; it should be inexpensive, and is at its best
when under two years old. Few wines go so wonderfully
well with good food, and fine Beaujolais is unquestion-
ably among the most agreeable red table wines in the
world—fruity, full-bodied, with a special, almost spicy
flavor and no trace of harshness.
