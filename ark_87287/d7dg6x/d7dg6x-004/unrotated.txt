SCOTCH OF
DISTINCTION

Try an experiment—compare this to
premium Scotches for which you are
now accustomed to paying over $8 .

the bottle.

SCOTCH

We can fully understand why the
Members of the Board chose
DOUGLAS as their favorite Scotch.
It is distilled and bottled in Scotland

by the 180 year old firm. Not a doubt-
ful product of an obscure distillery.

Certainly worth over $6.

_vour Royale Brut

Don’t overlook this one. Best
non-vintage Champagne in dec-
ade. A happy blend of the light
and elegant 1960’s, combined
with the wonderful, fruity
1959’s. Though no vintage date
appears on label, probably sur-
passes in balance and finesse
most famed vintage Cham-
pagnes currently available.
Specially priced.

La Seine

Full litre (33 oz.) of great
French aperitif at only $2.49!
Compare this to American
aperitifs that command almost
$4.00 the bottle and yet hold
only 24 oz. If ever there was a
“BEST BUY” this is it. In our
opinion, not surpassed in qual-
ity by any aperitif wine pro-
duced in France, regardless of
name or price. Not even a
thrifty Frenchman can do any

better.

CLIFTON FADIMAN comments

on the recent wine article written by
our associate, Sam Aaron, for House

Beautiful.

“Mr. Aaron is now the Wine Columnist for
HOUSE BEAUTIFUL, a circumstance
tending to make more possible the Life
Satisfying. His article, here reprinted from
that excellent publication, not only sup-
plies positive information of rare utility,
but is a splendid example of salutary de-
structiveness. His five “Rules to Ignore”
go to the heart of the matter. Those of us
who have been bewildered by the abraca-
dabra of temperature, aging, decanting,
vintage years and wine-glasses need no
longer remain in a state of befuddled in-
timidation. Not that Mr. Aaron is a hearty,
back-slapping, common man of Wine. He
is an expert. He knows all about the rituals,
nuances, the minutiae of the art of wine-
drinking. But he has reduced them to com-

mon sense,

Should you want
a reprint, kindly
write Sherry’s

mailed to you
immediately,
without charge.

VODKA

  

It is interesting to observe that Vodka,
which was born in central Europe,
finds its best expression in New Eng-
land as made by the traditional 133
year old firm of S. S. Pierce Co. Why

pay $4.50? 80 proof.
