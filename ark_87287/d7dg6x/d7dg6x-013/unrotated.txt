the wild American vine. Such ideas were
already firmly entrenched when the Re-
public was born: Jefferson devoted page
after page in his letters and personal
diary to vineyards’ and wine-making
methods in France and Germany, and
put himself on record to the effect that
“no nation is drunken where wine is
cheap, and none sober where the dear-
ness of wine substitutes ardent spirits as
the common beverage.”

By the 1820s a rather promising be-
ginning had been made. One Major
John Adlum, proud of his little planting
of Catawba vines in the District of Co-
lumbia, hopefully announced that .“in
bringing this grape [the Catawba] into
public notice, I have rendered my coun-
try a greater service than I could have
done had I paid off the national debt”
(then $84,000,000). Three decades
later there existed a flourishing young
wine industry in California, and wine
was being made commercially in twen-
ty-two of the thirty-two states, with
Ohio and Missouri in the lead. Nor were
imported wines by any means forgotten,
since—although it seems hard to believe
—the United States imported more wine
from France in the 1850s than in the
1950s. (According to. official. govern-
ment figures, we imported, in 1950,
642,555 gallons of table wine from
France and in 1960 a post-Prohibition
record, 2,040,813 gallons. Yet in 1860,
an average year for the period, the fig-
ure was 2,917,181 gallons. It should be
kept in mind, of course, that before
the Civil War there were no California
wines available in the Eastern states ex-
cept those that arrived mostly by sailing
vessels around the Horn. The trans-
continental railway changed everything;
California now supplies well over 80
per cent of our national consumption. )

Hap things worked out as planned,
and had wine-producing remained one
of the articles, however minor, of our
Manifest Destiny, we should perhaps all
be happier, and our national character
somewhat different. Or had light wines
been exempted, as Jefferson and Frank-
lin surely would have recommended,
from the rigors of national Prohibition,
the pattern of our daily living would
certainly be far from what it is today,
easier, less hurried, with fewer tensions
and, let us hope, more tolerance.

Table wine, or light wine, still and
sparkling, is the only alcoholic beverage
that continues to show, consistently,
year after year, an important increase
in per capita consumption in America;
yet it is still true that if every American
family began to serve, tomorrow, a bot-
tle of table wine with every Sunday
dinner, the cellars of California would
be empty in six months. Economists,
whose competence in this field: much
surpasses my own, have said that table
wine has by far the highest potential

growth factor of any agricultural prod-

uct, and indeed of any industry not
based on unpredictable new inventions,
in the United States.

All of this has begun to seem so ob-
vious and so normal today that it is hard
to understand why, in this country, wine
(and indeed good cooking) were treated
for a good many years like rather dis-
reputable, somewhat seedy
the other arts. Was it some
Puritanism that led Americans to dis
trust and depreciate two of their five

senses, taste and smell? Or was

Tt is certainly true that wine, at the
layman’s level, seems to have no ac-
cepted, reasonably exact, written lan-
guage. It has inspired, heaven knows,
more than its full share of paeans and
drinking-songs, technical manuals, and
cute little guides to what is called “wine
service.” But the true, precise, vocabu-
lary of wine (and it exists )
the jargon or cant of professionals and
experts, who, like baseball players and
atomic scientists, have their own, quite
special lingo. Experts, in the narrow
field of wine, are not so numerous as we
are sometimes led to suppose, but they
are not charlatans, and they understand
one another. You will find most of the
words they use in any standard English
(or French or Spanish or German or
Italian) dictionary, but rarely and al-
most never accurately defined with re-
spect to wine.

It is for this reason that a new, mas-
sive volume, published late last year in
Paris by the Office International de la
Vigne et du Vin, is both unique and very
welcome. It was prepared with the as-

sistance and partly under the auspices
of the Food and Agriculture Organiza-
tion of the United Nations. and_ its
title, by no means an overstatement, is
