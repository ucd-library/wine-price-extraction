Boswell SCOTCH

“‘Astonishing!’’ commented four experts at our
recent tasting. ‘‘It has all the flavor, the bal-
ance, and the excellence of superior Scotch
and yet — only $3.99.”

This is the strength of Scotch in Britain —
they call it 70 British Proof and we call it 80
American Proof. Its excellence is indisputable
— its budget-saving possibilities undeniable.

For added savings, there are full quarts at
$4.95 each, $56.50 the case.

6 YEAR OLD

No ordinary event to obtain a straight. sour

1960 Chateau

L Mouton Rothschild

Believe it or not, the citizens of Bordeaux can-
not buy this superb Claret from their local
wholesale wine merchants at this astonishingly
low price. An early purchase made this pos-
sible. Quantity limited.

And for those who prefer the wines of Baron
Elie de Rothschild rather than those of Baron
Phillipe de Rothschild, proprietor of Mouton
— we have good news. We have available a
small quantity of Chateau Lafite Rothschild
1960 at the same low price of $3.99 the bottle.
