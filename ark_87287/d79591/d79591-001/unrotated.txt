We Invite You
to Share Some
of Our Christmas
Discoveries

Wines, spirits and gifts that reflect indi-
viduality, good taste and imagination...
where there is always time to discuss your
choice, to advise in an unhurried atmos-
phere... where the prices are the lowest in
town... where delivery before Christmas
day can be relied upon... where, in short,
Christmas shopping is a joy...

As 1967 ends, the consumer
has pleasantly discovered that
some of his favorite spirits are
costing him less—but the wines
of Europe and America are fol-
lowing the inflation graph and
moving steadily upwards.

The economic implications are
apparent—now is the time to
anticipate your wine require-
ments before prices soar up-
wards. There is no similar
economic advantage in storing
away whiskies.

We still believe that it is the
merchants responsibility to
taste critically, and on behalf
of his clientele, the wines and
spirits that he offers. It is our
intent to maintain a sense of
responsibility and leadership
in the affairs of wines and
spirits, whether it be this Christ-
mas, next year or a decade
hence.

Open until 9:00 P.M. every evening, Dec. 11th until Christmas.
