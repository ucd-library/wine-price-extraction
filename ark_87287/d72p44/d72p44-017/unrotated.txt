FROM HOLLAND

Mint Chocolate
Liqueur

Do you like rich, Dutch
chocolate? Do you like
the cool, refreshing taste
of mint? If so, you will be
doubly pleased—whether
it be as a gift or for your
own pleasure—with VAN-
DERMINT.
Even the delightful delft-
like bottle captures the
spirit of Holland. Pour it
over shaved ice—delight-
ful over ice cream—mix

GRANT’S ROYAL
SCOTCH
12 YEARS OLD

Elsewhere, we sing the
praises of Glenfiddich
Unblended All-malt Glen-
livet whisky. One of the
most important ingredi-
ents in this remarkable 12
year old Grant’s Royal is
aged Glenfiddich whisky.
Our Scotch friends tell us
that it is the high ratio of
this remarkable all-malt
that is the secret of why
Grant’s 12 year achieves
such supremacy and
excellence.

If you are interested in
Scotch at its best,
whether it be for your
own pleasure, or as an
exceptional gift, this one
should not be over-
looked.

CHATEAU FIGEAC

FIRST GREAT GROWTH — ST. EMILION

CHATEAU FIGEAC expresses the robust, round qualities
of St. Emilion—and at its best. FIGEAC is directly adja-
cent to Cheval Blanc, shares its noble qualities—and in
our opinion, if the wines were tasted blind, it would be

its equal. Pay particu
remarkable—and we of

Bordeaux wholesale cost.
