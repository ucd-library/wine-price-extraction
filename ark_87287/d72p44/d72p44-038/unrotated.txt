BOODLES
English Gin at its Best

‘Boodles’ is perhaps the most prestigious private club in
all of London. The impeccability and good taste of Britain
is not only represented by this distinguished gathering
place, but also by the Gin that proudly bears its name.
The bottle is distinguished and crystalline in its appear-
ance—the contents are beyond reproach.

MORTLACH
12 YEAR OLD

Have you ever tasted a
single, unblended, all-malt
12 year old Scotch whisky?
In terms of delicacy, round-
ness and finesse, it can com-
pete with a fine Cognac from
France. As a matter of fact,
you can serve it in a brandy
snifter after dinner and your
guests will appreciate its
unique qualities.

BALLANTINE 12 YEAR OLD

The Ballantine distillery makes it a practice to set aside
their old reserves until they become 12 or more years
old. Only their best distillations are used for this pur-
pose. Recommended unreservedly to those who want to
experience the best of Scotland. (Below 131.01 case)

THOUGH IT IS NOT FEBRUARY, MANY GIFT-
GIVERS ARE SAYING “WILL YOU BE MY
BALLANTINE?”

Why? Since 1934, the name BALLANTINE on a bottle
of Scotch whisky has represented distinction, sophis-
tication, and an elegant harmony of all of the elements
that are necessary to create a soft, light, and beautifully
balanced whisky. Its popularity—particularly for Christ-
mas gift-giving—has not faltered until this day.
