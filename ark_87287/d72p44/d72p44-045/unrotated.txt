GALLIANO FROM ITALY

LIQUORE GALLIANO is a classic which has spread its
charm from Italy and now entrances the globe. The flavor
is intriguing, unique, and utterly delightful. The demand
for it in the United States is astonishing. If you have
never tried it, we urge that you do so this Christmas.
Lends itself to gift-giving because of the tall dramatic

bottle and its unique contents.

DISCOVERED IN PARIS —THE RAREST,
FINEST, AND MOST REMARKABLE
BRANDIES AND EAUX-DE-VIE OF FRANCE

When in Paris, art lovers are advised to go to the Louvre
—and brandy lovers to visit Jean Danflou on Rue Thabor.
We heeded this advice and found the most remarkable
treasure trove of Eaux-de-Vie, Armagnacs and Cognacs
we have ever experienced. There are few outstanding
gourmets in Paris that have not frequented the ‘brandy
boutique’ of Mr. Danflou.

 

We happily report we have brought the best examples

of his treasury to you—each the best within its class.

We urge that you send a bottle as a unique gift—we even —
more strongly advise that you buy a bottle for your own —
personal exploration and pleasure.
