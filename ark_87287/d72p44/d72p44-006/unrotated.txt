CHATEAU de LA CHAIZE
ARRIVES IN TIME TO
BRING ITS FRUIT AND
CHARM TO YOUR
WINTER LIVING!

This Brouilly 1973 won Gold Awards at
the Macon and Paris Fairs—as well as
the recent French National Wine Fair—
the first time in French wine history that
a single estate has been awarded all
three Gold Medals for the same vintage!

This 1973 BEAUJOLAIS BROUILLY, which made wine his-
tory by winning the Gold Award at three wine fairs, is the
proud, estate-bottled wine grown at Chateau de La Chaize, one
of the noblest and most highly regarded vineyards of all Beau-
jolais. Chateau de La Chaize has consistently been the best
selling red wine in our history—everyone loves it and comes
back for more. Unlike the lesser Beaujolais, this Grand Cru
Brouilly is not bottled immediately after the vintage, but in the
Spring following the harvest since it is a full, well-rounded
wine of character that requires added barrel age to bring out its
full potential and unique longevity. You will be delighted with
its dramatic, fruity, arbor-like qualities that will bring joy to
your dinner table during the Fall and Winter.

The LA CHAIZE vineyard, in the famed wine growing district
of Brouilly, has been maintained through successive genera-
tions for three centuries by the Marquis de Roussy de Sales
family. Tradition dictates that they never compromise with

dedication and excellence.

SHERRY-L
