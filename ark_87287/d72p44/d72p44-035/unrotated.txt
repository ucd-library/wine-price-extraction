comes the liqueur of Israel
SABRA. Its unique flavor rep-
resents a happy combination of
Jaffa oranges, subtly set off by
a hint of chocolate.

The decanter in, which Sabra
come is an exact replica of an
ancient Palestinian work of art
— ideally suited as a holiday
gift, or for your own personal

drinking pleasure.

Traditionally, a bit of Sabra is
added to a cup of steaming hot
tea; or it can be enjoyed on-
the-rocks; 2 oz. of Sabra with
1 oz. of lemon juice makes an
ideal Sour—or simply serve it
as is as an after dinner jiqueur.

BEEFEATER GIN

Rarely has any spirit cap-
tured the enthusiasm of
the American public as
has BEEFEATER ENG-
LISH GIN. Only two dec-
ades ago, the name was
primarily associated with
a beautifully uniformed
guard protecting the
Tower of London and
other historic monu-
ments. Now, should you
stop the nearest passer-
by and ask him the
meaning of ‘Beefeater’,
he will respond with ‘the
best gin in the world’. We
suspect future dictionar-
ies will record this fact.
If you have a friend who
likes gin, can you think
of a better gift to send
him than a few bottles of
BEEFEATER?
