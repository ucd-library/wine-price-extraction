 

ITALIAN WINES

Many wine drinkers are now turning to Italy to provide good
wine at modest cost. We have taken the challenge seriously,
and have searched out the best that Italy has to offer. We
particularly commend the litres and double-litres as among the
best values in good red and white wine for the money—the
Ghemme, for a glorious, big red—and the Soave, for your daily
everyday wine.

RHINES AND MOSELLES

The better Rhines and Moselles often reach superb heights-
particularly during the 1971 vintage, the best since 1953—and
are certainly among the best white wines produced anywhere
on the globe. Despite the upwards reevaluation of the German
mark and the devaluation of the dollar, we are happy to report
that you can drink superb estate-bottled examples at liveable
prices. For best values for present drinking we particularly
commend the 1970 Rhines and Moselles you will not regret
their acquisition.
