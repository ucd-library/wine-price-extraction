in Frontier Chest

It was the simple faith of Lem Motlow, and his sons, who started the JACK
DANIEL Distillery in Tennessee, back in the 19th Century, that has brought it a
place of high leadership among the premium bourbons of America. They simply
believed that if they could make the best whiskey they could, even if it was expen-
sive, people would buy it. Their little distillery at Lynchburg continues to have
‘ts ducks waddle, its horses pull wagons, its laborers stack ricks and chop down

hard maple trees.

As Christmas came nearer, and most distilleries sought out glittering gift wraps,

to make many of them, so that they are scarce. The
Chests look rather like an overgrown, giant cigar-
box. but made of thick wood, with two simple
clasps. It is not elaborate, but in the words of the
artisan “It’s sure pretty.”

The price of a bottle of Jack Daniel is below $7.96
__ three bottles cost below $23.86 — the added
; charge for the Frontier Chest is only $2.00. What
a wonderful Christmas gift to send your friends—
and you might even possibly consider sending it to
yourself! But please order promptly because both
the whiskey and the chest, are short in supply and
they will soon be all gone!

the Jack Daniel people looked in their own backyard, the Tennessee woods, for
their inspiration. They liked the smell and look of the local wood and decided
to build a crude, primitive, but handsome Frontier Chest. There was hardly time
