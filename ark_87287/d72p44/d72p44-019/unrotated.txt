RED BORDEAUX

We happily report, thanks to the record crop of the 1973 vin-
tage, that the upward price trend of Chateau-bottled red
Bordeaux has ceased. As a matter of fact, you will discover
that most of the Clarets listed below are available at lower
prices than those that prevailed a year ago.

1971 VINTAGE

We give you two superb examples that will permit you to
experience, in outstanding fashion, the excellence of the 1971
vintage in Bordeaux, and offer the great Lafite Rothschild for
1975 delivery.

No. Bottle Case

443. PAVES DES CHARTRONSG..........----. 3.24 35.00
Guy Schyler brings us this discovery, a happy blend of
the best wines of his unusual cellars. The name of the
wine reflects the fact that M. Schyler and his ancestors
have lived in the ‘Paves des Chartrons’ area since 1739.
Washington Irving was a frequent visitor to the Schyler
home. Montaigne, Montesquieu and Francois Mauriac
also maintained residences nearby. The excellence of the
wine reflects the nobility of the heritage.

448 CHATEAU LATOUR DE BY (Medoc)...... 3.99 43.10
Chateau-bottled from some of the best soil of the Medoc.
Big, fat, remarkable—long-lived.

139 CHATEAU LAFITE ROTHSCHILD

(Pauillac) ............-0eseeeeereeees _ 295.00

In many instances, the 1971 vintage in Bordeaux has
shown greater depth, balance, intensity and longevity
than 1970. This is particularly true of Lafite Rothschild,
with many Bordeaux experts sharing this opinion. How-
ever, we are convinced, that those who look ahead to
future decades, would do well to put away a case or two
of the truly glorious Lafite Rothschild 1971. With each
passing year, the dividends in drinking pleasure will in-
crease. Delivery—mid-1975.

1970 CHATEAU BOTTLED

We have all heard of the intrinsic greatness, warmth, depth of
flavor and longevity of the fabulous 1970 red Bordeaux—un-
doubtedly the best vintage year in Bordeaux since the legendary
‘455 and ’61s. We offer them in their full range. From our vast
selection, we single out below those 1970 Clarets that we con-
sider excellent within their class as well as being outstanding
values. Now is the time to acquire them—while they are still
available.

357. CHATEAU GRAND MAISON..........-- 2.99 32.30
From Cotes du Bourg, across the Gironde River. A dis-
covery for those who want good red Bordeaux at modest

6002 CHATEAU LAFITE ROTHSCHILD
IN DOUBLE-MAGNUM
(equal to 4 regular bottles)........-.-. 195.00 -
It was not Lafite Rothschild but Mouton Rothschild of
1929 (in the same size—the Double-Magnum) that recently
fetched about $9,000.00 a bottle at auction. However, the
vintage was 1929 and not 1970. Will the 1970, an equally
great year, and the vineyard is the great Lafite Rothschild,
fetch $9,000.00 the bottle in the year 1999? We do not
know. These giant Double-Magnums come from the per-
sonal vineyard reserve of Baron Elie de Rothschild and
are true collector’s items. Not many are in existence. It
is the kind of wine that you can consider laying down
for your children and grandchildren who can drink it
joyously 25 years hence. Quantity limited.

1969 CHATEAU BOTTLED

Because of half normal production, the opening prices of the
1969 were record breaking. Some exceptional examples have
reached our shores. Here are outstanding values from top flight
vineyards of Bordeaux. Note that most of these being offered
are substantially below the prices that prevailed earlier this
year.

our shop—our clients come back for more and more.
Suggest early acquisition before depletion.
