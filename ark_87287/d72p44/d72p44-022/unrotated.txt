Here are the most beloved red wines of France. Rich in fruit,
charm, and innocent attractiveness—wines that do not stress
intellectual qualities, but rather easy sensuality. In short, they
are not wines to be laid down for future drinking but to be
consumed joyously during the first few years of their life. All
of those listed below are from impeccable sources and among
them there is the Chateau de La Chaize—a vineyard that enjoys
the reputation of perhaps being the best single source of Beau-
jolais of the entire area.

1973 VINTAGE

The harvest was plentiful; the wines fruity, typical. The
Brouilly, Chateau de La Chaize 1973, made history when it won
the Gold Medal both at the Macon Fair and at the Paris Expo-
sition. Never before, has the same wine won both Gold and
Silver Awards at both blind competitions in the same year. We
urge that you acquire this remarkable 1973 to add its delicious-
ness to your winter entertaining.

282 BROUILLY, CHATEAU DE LA CHAIZE... 3.99 44.50
man This Brouilly 1973, estate-
BROUILLI bottled at Chateau de La
“ weonat .% Chaize, is considered by
gihe, wine authorities as possibly
the best single example of
fruity, well balanced red
wine produced in the soil of
| Beaujolais. As pointed out
above, it won Gold and Sil-
ver Awards at the Macon
a and Paris Fairs. The Chateau
y de La Chaize vineyard, in the
, famed wine growing district
of Brouilly, has been maintained through successive genera-
tions for three centuries by the Marquis de Roussy de Sales
family. It will add distinction to your entertaining and the price
is astonishingly low in light of its eminence. Also available in
half-bottles and magnums at $3.00 the case additional.

1972 VINTAGE

1972 is an interesting year in Beaujolais. Those produced on
the flatlands were too acid and lacked fruit. Those produced
on the better vineyards on the hillsides were more favored and
produced a beautiful balance of fruit and acidity.

323 BEAUJOLAIS (J. Cimetiere).............. 2.49 26.90
Vigorous, rich in fruit, excellent.
292 BEAUJOLAIS VILLAGES
(Chateau de La Chaize).............--- 2.99 32.30
This Beaujolais Villages represents the best value in
superb Beaujolais we have ever offered. Why? Actually,
this wine is identical to the Brouilly of La Chaize but
French regulation permit the production of only so many
cases of Brouilly per acre or hectare. The excess beyond
the limit is not permitted to bear the name Brouilly, but
must be called Beaujolais Villages, even though the wine
is identical. This is exactly what happened in this in-
stance, as testified to by the proprietor, Marquis de
Roussy de Sales. If you forego the name, but are willing
to settle for the same wine in the bottle, we suggest that
you acquire this one. ecieiie

298 BEAUJOLAIS VILLAGES one)
(Chateau de La Chaize)—in 18 oz. pichet. 2.39 51.90
WHAT IS A PICHET? It is that handsome, smaller bottle
holding 18 ounces—the ideal size for ‘dinner-for-two’—
not so large as the regular bottle, but generously larger
than the half-bottle. Pichets are a most useful in-between

size. Case of 24.

307 MORGON (jean Bleton)...........-----: 3.49 37.70
Morgon, among the most northernmost of the Beaujolais
vineyards, exhibits some of the characteristics of the
red Burgundies located even further north. Long-lived,
deep, excellent.

351 FLEURIE (A. Depardon)..........------: 3.49 37.70

Fruit, balance, bouquet combine to give a light, delicious

Beaujolais.

1971 VINTAGE

Because of tannin and depth, this is the year that made Beau-
jolais taste like the wines of the Céte d’Or. Surprisingly long-
lived—the two listed below should continue to thrive for another
five years.

No. Bottle Case

200: CHENAS sich ii eae ve hie ee 8 ee 3.99 43.10
Exceptionally favored Beaujolais area. Rich in fruit and
depth. Estate-bottled, Domaine Laneyrie.

Seen. ee 3.99 43.10
The Pouilly-Fuissé and Julienas that Laneyrie produces
set the standard for excellence in the area.

RED BURGUNDY

Among recent vintages, ‘1970’ was the ‘star’ in Bordeaux; the
‘1969’ took the center of the stage in Burgundy—to be followed
by an even greater ‘star’ 1971, a year which some claim to
be the best vintage for red Burgundy since 1929.

It must be remembered that the great vineyards of the Cote
d'Or produce but a small fraction of the quantity yielded by
the chateaux in Bordeaux. This was particularly true of the
’69s and ’71s, years that produced superb quality but pitiably
low quantity.

We happily report that we bring you some of the great gems
of 1971 and 1969. Choose among them now—while a full selec-
tion is available.

1971 RED BURGUNDIES

st PINOT NOM... .co 6 eet 4.29 46.35
Don’t let the modest appellation which only indicates
the grape variety discourage you. In truth, we are deal-
ing with an excellent estate-bottling by Quillardet, pro-
duced skillfully on some of the better soil of the Céte
d’Or. If you are interested in what is in the bottle, and
not so much in what is on the label, here is a ‘best buy.’
Accidentally, the grower neglected to affix the vintage
label, but it is actually 1971.
