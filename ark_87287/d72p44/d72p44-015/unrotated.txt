FROM PORTUGAL
MATEUS ROSE AND MATEUS BRANCO
THE MOST SOUGHT AFTER
ROSE AND WHITE WINES

We are all familiar with Mateus rosé in its handsome squat
bottle—the table wine that is the most popular, not only in the
United States, but in many other parts of the globe.

The same good firm of Mateus also produces a dry, crisp white
wine which bears the name of ‘Mateus Branco.’

Choose among them, dependent on the occasion—they are
both available at 3.19 the bottle. (34.50 the case)

GRANT’S
8 YEAR OLD SCOTCH

This Scotch deserves recogni-
tion—it is not to be taken for
‘granted.’ It is a proud product
of an individual family distillery
—every drop is 8 or more years
old—a consistent favorite in the
British Isles—and a happy har-
mony of all of the elements that
are necessary to move a Scotch
upward from standard accep-
tance into a more exalted, more
mellow, more appreciated area.
Recommended for gift-giving.
