DEWAR’S ANCESTOR
12 YEAR OLD SCOTCH

ANCESTOR means going back to the oldest or ancient
origin. The DEWAR’S distillery does this very thing
when they bottle their 12 Year Old reserve and proudly
call it ANCESTOR. Perhaps there are whiskies produced
in Scotland that might rival this one, but certainly, none
are better—we are dealing with ultimate perfection in the
blending art here. Not many cases reach America—this
venerable Scotch is hard to come by. It will flatter any-
one on your gift list and honor any of your guests, when
served in your home. Suggest ordering early before the

limited supply vanishes. (Below 127.59 case)

TRADITIONAL DRINK OF BRITISH NAVY
PLYMOUTH GIN

The fame of Plymouth Gin goes back over 150 years of
loyal support by officers and sailors of the British Navy.
The expression ‘Plymouth, Old Boy’ brings back to re-
tired British admirals a thousand memories of ‘Pink Gin’
consumed in every clime. (‘Pink Gin’ is simply 2 drops
of Angostura bitters added to 2 icy ounces of Plymouth
Gin).

PLYMOUTH GIN owes its superiority to dedicated dis-
tillation, a secret, unrevealed recipe, and the soft clear
water of the river Dart. There is only one Plymouth Gin
in the whole world, and that is made in Plymouth,
England, by Coates & Co., established in 1793. It is 94.4
proof, extra dry, and will produce the driest, cleanest
Martini you have ever experienced. The price is aston-
ishingly low. Normally, this world-famous Gin commands

below 6.61 the bottle. Note our sale price. (Below 79.25
