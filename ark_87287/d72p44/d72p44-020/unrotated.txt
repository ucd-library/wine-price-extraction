1968 CHATEAU BOTTLED

Likely to be overlooked as a vintage, but some good examples
were produced, filling an important gap—and at a liveable price
that will permit you to experience the subtleties and nobility
of the soil of the famed Bordeaux vineyards.

CHATEAU LA MISSION HAUT BRION... 4.99 53.90
Consistently, La Mission Haut Brion produces superb
wine during vintages that are not necessarily great. This
amazing 1968 thoroughbred proves it.

CHATEAU LATOUR .......----+-eeeee> 9.95 107.45
Because of a high ratio of Cabernet Sauvignon, Chateau
Latour develops depth even during a relatively light year
such as 1968. A big, fat wine that will delight now and
for another decade.

CHATEAU PETRUS........-.---:eeeee::> 10.95 118.25
Relatively small in size, the noble Petrus vineyard, the
indisputable giant of Pomerol, is among the most sought-
after red wines of the world. The fruit, depth and gran-
deur of this 1968 will astonish you.

1967 CHATEAU BOTTLED

Many authorities in Bordeaux consider 1967 perhaps the best of
recent vintages for current drinking. We are inclined to agree.

will find them exceptionally soft, fruity and utterly de-

licious immediately and for the next six years.

CHATEAU BOUSCAUT ........----+-:°: 5.99 64.70
Classified ‘Grand Cru’ Graves. Owned by a distinguished
group of Americans. Its 18th Century chateau is con-
sidered one of the most beautiful examples of architec-
ture in southwest France.

CHATEAU MARQUIS DE TERME........ 6.99 75.50
Attention should be paid here! We are dealing with a
great growth of Margaux, classified in 1855. Fine texture,
very elegant, will live long—averages only 7,500 cases a
year. Worth much more.

CHATEAU LEOVILLE POYFERRE.......- 7.99 86.30

The supreme vineyard of St. Emilion. Exceptionally low
price for this classic.

CHATEAU LATOUR .......----++++s0055 26.95 291.05
There are some who claim that Chateau Latour is the
best single wine produced in the Medoc during 1967.
CHATEAU MOUTON ROTHSCHILD..... 29.50 318.60
Frank Schoonmaker states this is the best of the ’67s. A
true long-lived glory.

CHATEAU PETRUS........----:+++002: 34.95 377.45
In addition to intrinsic greatness, this is the scarcest of
the exalted wines of Bordeaux. Produces less than 20%
of a Lafite or a Mouton. Perhaps this accounts partially
for the high price.

1966 CHATEAU BOTTLED

A great, great claret year—a worthy successor to the classic

‘61s and an excellent precursor to the

70s. In the grand tradi-

tion—beautifully balanced—long-lived. Rapidly disappearing off
the market.
