markable Bourbon existed in Kentucky at the time we made
our fortunate discovery. In our opinion, this remarkable
whiskey of unusual mellowness, balance and bouquet, is in
the classic tradition of the pre-prohibition Bourbons that
were the whiskey pride of the mid-'30s. The famous ones,

such as Old Grandad, O

collector's items to join the ranks of 19th Century
vintage Cognac, 1929 Romanee Conti, and rare
early American prints. (Some of these whiskies,
now, when found, fetch up to $50 the bottle.)

All of us here at Sherry’s were excited when we
first tasted this 1938 Bourbon. It was superb, rich
in flavor, yet remarkably delicate. There were only
280 cases in all Kentucky ~ we bought them all.
Made at a small country distillery back in 1938, it
was kept in oak barrel for 8 years until it achieved
full maturation — then it was bottled-in-bond at
100 proof in 1946.

We proudly offer these 280 cases (there are no
more ~ each bottle bears its own handwritten num-
ber on the neck label) to those seeking one of the

examples of Kentucky Bourbon in existence
