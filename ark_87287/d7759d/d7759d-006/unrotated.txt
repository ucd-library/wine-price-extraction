We tasted it at the vineyard, one of the
best of Beaujolais, fell in love with this
delightful pink wine and persuaded the
owners to part with a small quantity. It is
remarkable and highly recommended.

363 — HERMITAGE 1954

The 1954 vintage proved more successful
in the sunny Rhone Valley than elsewhere
in France. Produced at a tiny vineyard,
considered the best of Hermitage, only 25
cases were allocated to the United States.
An extraordinary thoroughbred at amaz-
ingly low cost.

387 — CHATEAUNEUF AT ITS BEST

Towering high above the town of Chateau-
neuf, in the rockiest of soil, can be found
this eagle's nest of a vineyard. After three
days in the town comparing, we are con-
vinced that if one is seeking the best that
Chateauneuf has to offer, it can be found

at Clos des Felibres.
