Occasionally, perhaps only
once in a decade, in a particu-
larly great vintage year, the
Counts of Kesselstatt put
aside in a special reserve
(known as the Schatzkeller
or “Treasure Cellar”) a few
hundred cases of their most
remarkable Moselles. 1949
was such a year. The Moselle
vineyards, on the whole, pro-
duced wines which, in ele-
gance and bouquet, may well
prove the best of our genera-
tion. Certainly, no finer exam-
ples of Moselle can be found
than these incomparable
wines from the “Treasure Cel-
lar.” One of these wines re-
ceived the Bundes-Siegerpreis
which means that it was
ranked as the best 1949 of
all Germany. Each bottle of
this limited reserve was indi-
vidually numbered at the
vineyard cellar.
