INTERESTING “BEST BUYS”

IN WINES

by
FRANK SCHOONMAKER

 
 

a ) | Wine lovers, by now, hardly need to be told how
charming, satisfying and delightful French wines
can be, even when their origin is not Bordeaux or
Burgundy. Mr. Schoonmaker has spent a lifetime
visiting and tasting through the vineyard byways—

: Beaujolais, the Loire, the Rhone and Provence. Here
are true discoveries, and we have supplemented

them with three Italian wines and one intriguing
Claret.

We cordially invite you to share with Mr. Schoon-
maker some of the joys he experienced seeking out
these wines.

806 BEAUJOLAIS BLANC 1964, Chateau des Correaux...... 1.69 18.25

For those who like Pouilly Fuissé, here is a successful counterpart from Beaujolais; utterly delightful and
at low cost.

324 POUILLY-VINZELLES 1964, Union des Co-operatives... 1.99 21.50

Lighter and shorter-lived than Pouilly-Fuissé, but better than some. A “best value” in white Burgundy.

292 POUILLY-FUISSE 1964, Union des Co-operatives. ..... 2.49 26.90
Somewhere between Meursault and Chablis in character. Typical, excellent.

277. +=POUINLLY-FUISSE 1964, DaWon .* -. 72.3... 2.79 30.15
Good estate-bottled Pouilly Fuissé is hard to come by. Dutron is one of the best growers.

377  CHABLIS PREUSES 1965, Maurice Fevre .............. 2.79 30.15

Frank Schoonmaker believes (and based on tasting, we agree) that an off-year such as 1965 frequently
produces a more elegant, dry and satisfying Chablis than in a great year.

322 CHABLIS, MONTEE DE TONNERRE, 1964, M. Servin... 2.99 32.30

A Premier Cru vineyard producing a light, clean and typical Chablis.

625 POUILLY-FUISSE, ROCHETTE, 1964, Plumet .......... 2.99 32.30
If Pouilly Fuissé has a ‘‘Montrachet” you will find it in the cellars of Plumet. Amazingly good.

5905 “MEURSAULT 1962, Matrolt....... SS a 2.99 32.30
Green-gold in color, full-bodied, but racy, well balanced and dry.

270  CHABLIS BUTTEAUX 1961, Monin .:..2.:3 .. 2. 2.99 32.30

The most long-lived and typical Chablis were produced in 1961. We fortunately were able to acquire a
few cases.

412 . MEQVUESALEET 1961, Mawel... .. 2... 3 te 2.99 32.30
Similar to the Meursault above, but longer-lived and not quite as ready for drinking.

837 MEURSAULT GENEVRIERES 1964, Pierre Poupon ...... 3.49 37.70
The Genevrieres vineyard is only 42 acres and represents the best of Meursault.

331 CHABLIS PREUSES 1964, Maurice Fevre .............. 3.59 38.75
There are seven tiny Grand Cru vineyards in Chablis (only 6,000 cases in total) and Preuses is one of the best.
407 MEURSAULT BLAGNY 1962, Matrot ................ 3.99 43.10

The ‘“Blagny” vineyard is but five acres. Exhibits high quality and real distinction.

416 CHASSAGNE-MONTRACHET, CAILLERETS, 1962,
B. kamneact =... Se SF. ee 4.49 48.50

Of almost equal excellence with le Montrachet itself. A magnificent white wine by any standards.

431 PULIGNY-MONTRACHET, PERRIERES, 1961, Sauzet.... 4.79 51.75

A classic white Burgundy. Austere, great depth; good for many years.

267 PULIGNY-MONTRACHET, CHALUMEAUX, 1962, Matrot 4.49 48.50

In 1961, there was the touch of immortality among the great white Burgundies. This one will be outstanding
a decade from now.

426 CORTON CHARLEMAGNE 1964, Chabot-Bonnes...... 5.49 59.30

From the steepest hillside of all Burgundy. A white wine that exhibits the depth of le Montrachet.

342 BIENVENUE BATARD MONTRACHET 1964, C. Ramonet 5.99 64.70

Until recently, it was simply sold as Batard Montrachet. Certainly its equal (it costs as much) and one of
the “greats.”

337 CHASSAGNE MONTRACHET, MORGEOT, 1964,
Marauis-de lasuich@ 5 2 6.89 74.20

“Laguiche” on the label carries the same exalted significance as Comte de Vogue, Domaine de la Romanee
Conti, Chateau Haut Brion, etc. A glory.

581 BIENVENUE BATARD MONTRACHET 1962, Ramonet.. 6.99 75.50
From the same vineyard and producer as the “Bienvenue” listed above, but shows better for immediate
drinking.

616 MEURSAULT CHARMES 1961, Hospices de Beaune.... 6.99 75.50

The “Cuvee Grivault” of Meursault consistently fetches one of the highest prices at the annual Hospices de
Beaune auction. Good for anothr 10 years.

838 MONTRACHET 1964, Pierre Poupon ..............-. 8.40 91.80

‘Montrachet’ is the greatest single white wine vineyard in France. However, our tasting notes reveal that it
is not quite as fine or deep as either of the ‘Bienvenue Batard Montrachets’ listed above.
