Bonne Auberge, on the Cote d’Azur, is one of the great inns of France. This

Sl WISDOM’S FINO PALMA... .. . 1.59 17.95

A magnificent example of bone dry, pale, straw colored Sherry. This classic “Fino Palma” has helped
Wisdom & Warter achieve its great international reputation, now a century old. An ideal aperitif when
served slightly chilled. The equal of many Finos that command $3.00 or more the bottle.

S2 WISDOM’S ROYAL BROWN OLOROSO . 1.79 19.95

There are few wines produced in the world that quite achieve the rich, deep flavor, or dark color
depth of a fine Brown Sherry. Here is a typical, fully aged example. Highly recommended between
meals with fruit, nuts or cake, or as an after-dinner dessert wine.

S3. WISDOM’S AMONTILLADO FINO . . . 1.99 22.65

As this name implies, a good Amontillado belongs to the Fino family, but they acquire certain different
characteristics as they mature; the color becomes more amber-like. As in the Finos, they are very dry,
more nutty in flavor and develop greater body. Here is a perfect example of fine Amontillado that
normally commands well over $3.00 the bottle.

S4. WISDOM’S GOLDEN CREAM. . . . . 2.49 27.95

Generally speaking, a top-flight Cream Sherry such as this is the oldest and most luxurious of the wines
found in the Bodegas of Jerez. Usually, a fine Cream Sherry of a reputable firm commands $5.00 or
more the bottle. It is no ordinary event to obtain this medium dry, dramatically rich, wine for only
$2.49. We urge that you try it.
