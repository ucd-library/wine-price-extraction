Pierre Poupon takes his wine growing seriously. He was weaned on the various ‘Vin
Roses’ in France, and resolved to provide an outstandingly fine Vin Rosé in Burgundy, s
ONLY

using the classic Pinot Noir grape. The same variety used to produce Chambertin,

Musigny, Clos Vougeot, etc. Our tastings of this “Pinot Noir Rose 1964” gives strong 50
evidence that he has succeeded. The noble character of this grape and the Burgundian apd $ Di
soil are reflected very clearly to the palate. Here is a pink wine of unusual class and

character, completely dry and with distinguished bouquet. If you have found that BOTTLE THE CASE
ordinary Vin Rosé lacked taste and interest, we urge that you try this one. \
