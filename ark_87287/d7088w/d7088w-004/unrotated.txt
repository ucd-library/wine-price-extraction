561 KASELER KEHRNAGEL AUSLESE 1949 (Fuder 9209) . . . . 4.49

The Ruwer, which is hardly wider than a trout stream, bubbles down out of its forest-covered hills to join the Moselle a few miles
east of Trier. Some of the steep vineyards along its lower valley yield wines that have a special, spicy aroma and a flower-like ¢
delicacy and charm all their own. This excellent Auslese is the finest Ruwer wine produced by the Kesselstatt Domain in 1949.

562 PIESPORTER GOLDTROPFCHEN FEINE SPATLESE 1949, . . 4.99
(Fuder 9143)

The wines of the little village of Piesport, in good years, have a special quality — a lightness, a fragrance which renders them
unique, even among the many charming wines of the Middle-Moselle. Piesporter Goldtropfchen is ranked as one of the Moselle’s
half dozen greatest vineyards, and this. surpassing Feine Spatlese is, in every way, worthy of the great name it bears

563. JOSEPHSHOFER FEINE AUSLESE 1949 (Fuder 9018) . . . . 3.979 66.00
The Josephshof vineyard, entirely owned by the Kesselstatt family (who have owned vineyards on the Moselle for over 600 years),
is situated between Berncastel and Wehlen, in the heart of the Middle-Moselle country. This 1949 is a true Auslese — rich, full
and magnificent.
564 PIESPORTER FALKENBERG FEINSTE SPATLESE 1949 _. 299 68.50

(Fuder 9122

On looking over the tasting notes which I made in the Kesselstatt Cellars last summer, I find that I gave this wine 19!4 points

out of a possible 20. One of the most perfect Moselles I have ever tasted

565 JOSEPHSHOFER FEINSTE SPAT-AUSLESE 1949 (Fuder 9021). . IL.73

ee
Awarded the Staatsehrenpreis (State Honor Prize) and ranked by a jury of German experts as one of the best 1949s produced in
the Moselle Valley. Full and yet delicate, with a bouquet that is nothing short of astonishing. Extremely limited quantity

566 PIESPORTER GOLDTROPFCHEN FEINSTE AUSLESE 1949
6 (Fuder 9110)

Awarded the Bundeseigerpreis (Highest Award in Germany) and ranked as the finest wine produced in the Moselle-Saar-Ruwet and
Middle-Rhine district in the great year 1949. One of the greatest wines of our generation. Only a few bottles available
