TREFETHEN VINEYARDS - When we got to the vineyard,
; Janet Trefethen was in the kitchen preparing
a wonderful lunch for us. Her husband, John,
had just returned from his favorite hobby ,
flying his own plane. Here is truly a family
enterprise with several frefethens involved, all
proud of their well-cultivated vineyards, the
wine they make, and the life they live. Ever
since their Chardonnay came out first ag: 1inst
the ee of France at the Oc tober Paris
Gault-Millau tasting, the demand has become so

great, fae it is doled out by bottles, rather

than by cases.

The winelover who visits San Francisco, usually drives north to Napa and
Sonoma Valleys. Yet, there is often as much reward should he choose to head
his car south or east to Livermore Valley, Alameda, Santa Clara, Santa Cruz,
San Benito, Monterey, San Luis Obispo and Santa Ynez. Great strides have been
made here, thanks to guidance from the Davis School of Oenology, planting
superior varietals, and dedicated striving towards perfection on the part of
the winemakers. Some prime examples are listed below.

 

CALLAWAY Eli Callaway, former President of Burlington Industries, disco\ ered
a perfect microclimate in the hills near San Diego. His whites are

delightful: his reds incredibly intense.

THE FIRESTONE VINEYARD - This model showplace vineyard
was established on the side hills of the Santa
Ynez Valley in 1972 by the prestigious Firestone
family former ambassador Leonard K. Fireston
and his dedicated son, Brooks Firestone. The
oenologiest is Anthony Austin and the wine
consultant is the lengendary Andre Tchelistcheff.
\ll this represents a superb background for
making top-flight wine. With each passing year,
the wines have improved and now they can hold
th eit own against their northern neighbors in
Napa and Sonoma Valleys. Some of the best values

 

il Cal ifornia can be found here.

MONTEREY VINEYARD Some history required here. Originally this vineyard
consisted of 9,600 acres planted exclusively with choice varietal
rapes. The winemaker was (and still is) Dr. Richard Peterson who left
Beaulieu Vineyard to accept the challenge of the Monterey operation.
It is now a smaller vineyard, in new hands, which produces utterly
delightful red and white varietal wine

MONTEVINA VINEYARD - Some remarkable wine is produced in Amador County,
particularly by oenologist-owner Cary Gott. His Zinfandel is reminiscent
of Beaujolais, and his Cabernet is big and lusty.
