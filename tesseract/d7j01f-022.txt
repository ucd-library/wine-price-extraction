~ Rare, Irreplaceable
Vintage MADEIRA

From the
Last Century

   

“The very existence, let alone the sheer perfection of this
1805, is an historic wine event—these 19th Century Madeira
have provided one of the great wine tasting experiences of
my life,” states James Beard.

Here is an unusual offering of five remarkable, authentic
19th Century Vintage Madeiras. Each bottle is signed by a
director of the impeccable firm of Blandy certifying that
the bottle contains a genuine Madeira of the vintage stated.
? Most of these vintage Madeiras have disappeared from our
cellars, but these five thoroughbreds remain. We suggest
the acquisition of these precious bottles while they are on
sale during this period.

DISCOVERED
IN FRANCE

— RARE ESTATE-BOTTLED

BRANDIES oy

Frank Schoonmaker

"

Each year, since 1945, there has been a four
months’ search through the vineyards by Mr.
Schoonmaker, for the better wines of Europe.
Since he keenly appreciates a fine spirit when he
runs across it, he reports on some of his findings
among the Cognacs and Eaux-de-vie.

Wine lovers, by now, hardly need to be told how much dif-
ference there is between a great chateau-bottled Claret and
an ordinary regional wine from the Bordeaux Country.

Most of us have learned, too, that comparable, striking
differences exist in other categories of wine as well...the
splendid estate-bottlings from the Cote d’Or have little or
nothing in common with “shipper’s Burgundy”; the Moselles
and Rhines that carry the Original-A bfiilling of a great pro-
ducer are a long, long way from commercial Liebfraumilch.

It would seem right and reasonable to suppose that paral-
lel differences can be found in the related field of spirits,
and indeed they can. Those rare Cognacs and even rarer
Armagnacs which have been distilled, aged and estate-bottled
in France by small producers are, to say the least, completely

in a class apart; the same thing is true of estate-bottled Fruit
Brandies from Alsace—Mirabelle, Kirsch, Framboise.

If spirits of this sort are not particularly well-known, this
is because they are exceedingly hard to find. In terms of
quality they are simply extraordinary. Nevertheless, surpris-
ingly, they are not expensive. Bottled by farmers, they are
not dressed in an elaborate or fancy package—but neither,
for that matter, are the great chateau- and estate-bottled
wines. They are not nationally advertised, nor available every-
where. But if you visit the most distinguished restaurants of
France—the Pyramide (Point) at Vienne, the Cote d’Or
(Dumaine) at Saulieu, the Taillevent, among many, in
Paris, the Coq Hardi at Bougival, to name only a few...
these are the only spirits that you will find on the wine list.

No. Bottle Case
1301 RAGNAUD GRANDE FINE CHAMPAGNE COGNAC V.S.E.P. . 7.50 85.50

A superb estate-bottled Grande Fine Champagne at about the price of an ordinary three Star Cognac. Will pass the after-dinner

test beautifully.
1302 RESERVE NO. 14 (Grande Fine Champagne Cognac). . . 10.67 117.40

Monsieur Ragnaud’s best. A remarkable rarity, distilled in 1914.

1201 GASTON BRIAND GRANDE FINE CHAMPAGNE COGNAC . 17.50 195.00

Justly regarded by most experts as the greatest Cognac of France, distilled in 1904 by my friend of many years standing, the late Gaston
Briand. His widow will continue to supply this until her very limited ‘reserves are gone.

1294. BAS ARMAGNAC. (Domaine d’?Ognoas). . . . . . . . ©49 77.50

Produced by a government-owned experimental farm. 100 Proof. Very clean, a sensational value. Every drop of the 1941 vintage.

2101 MIRARELLE D°ALSACE (Estate bottled, Alfred Hess) 8.95 103.00

Best of the Alsatian plum brandies. My own favorite among the “alcools blancs”’.

2102 KIRSCH D°’ALSACE (Estate bottled, Alfred Hess) . . . . 10.50 118.00

A Kirsch of a quality rarely encountered. The late Monsieur Hess was considered the best distiller of Alsace.

2103 FRAMBOISE D°’ALSACE (Estate bottled, Alfred Hess). . . 13.95 158.00

Made from wild mountain raspberries in a still not much larger than a soup tureen. Remarkable for its fragrance and smoothness.

firm, has consented to part with a few of these treasured bottles—each is numbered

nineteenth century, we know of no better example—
