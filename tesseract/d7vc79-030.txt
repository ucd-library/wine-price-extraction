 

LARGE BOTTLES add a glamorous and dramatic note to the holiday dinner table—and when sent as a gift, they add a delightful
touch of festivity under the Christmas tree. These larger bottles are not easy to come by because many vineyards simply will not
go through the exceptional care and effort required to bottle

and ship them. It is also generally accepted by wine experts

everywhere that the longevity of a wine increases in relation to its size, since the ratio of air to wine in the bottle is reduced,}

and delays ultimate oxidation.

Many of the wines listed below are authentic and irreplaceable collector’s items designed to add lustre to any wine cellar. Most
are available in limited quantity, and if you see a favorite, we suggest that you order it early, before it becomes depleted.
