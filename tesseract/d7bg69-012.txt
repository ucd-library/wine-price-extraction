ICED CHAMPAGNE IN LE CAN-CAN...
has won great acclaim by boat voyagers during this
record-breaking tourist season. Seasoned travellers de-
clare that no gift is more appreciated or better-timed—
the iced Champagne arrives at the moment when it is
most needed—hbefore sailing time, when friends are
gathered in the stateroom ready to lift their glasses in
a farewell toast.

Not only is this Bon Voyage gift gay and imaginative,
but it need not even be expensive. Simply pick your
favorite Champagne on the opposite page (whether it
be one, three or a dozen bottles) and add only $2.95
additional to cover the cost of “LE CAN-CAN.”
