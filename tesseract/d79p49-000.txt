efi] giance to a Chateau Latour today, sings

the praises of a remarkable Montrachet

tomorrow, and vows ‘there never was such a wine as
‘Berncasteler Doctor” a week later. But this is as

it should be ~an unusually fine wine or a fine spirit —

ne
an expression of natures bounty and mans art—

deserves the recognition and admiration of the drinker.

It therefore was an experience not without some
indecision for us to select the wines and spirits for these
pages — too many loved ones had to be left out because
of space limitations ~ but they re all on view when

you visit the shop.

However, we are quite satisfied that those ultimate-
ly chosen here, whether Scotch, Burgundy, Moselle or
Bourbon, are prime examples within their class and
offer a pleasing taste experience, honest value, and in

many, many instances ~ sensational bargains.

We can think of no pleasanter way to greet the advent
of Autumn than to alert you in these pages to some of
our ‘favorites’ — those bottles

that we consider particularly notable.
