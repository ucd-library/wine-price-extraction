drinker cannot refrain from the
annual Yuletide custom of the EGG
NOG. It has now become habitual at
Sherrys to repeat our favorite recipe
for the benefit of those of you who may
have misplaced your copy during the
year. Here is our version of this time-

honored drink:

WHISKEY EGG NOG (50 CUPS)

Beat 12 egg yolks until light. Add
gradually 11% cups fine granulated
sugar and continue to beat until the
yolks are thick and light in color. Pour
this mixture into a punch bowl which
has been placed on a bed of cracked
ice. Whip in one quart heavy cream
and one quart milk and then add one
quart rye or bourbon very slowly at first,
stirring constantly. Let the punch settle
for a few minutes and lastly fold in 12
egg whites which have been beaten
until stiff. Serve with a sprinkle of
freshly grated nutmeg on top of each
portion.

and spirits I have yet seen. Here’s how
about two years ago

 

it all happened
my Sherry associate, Jack Aaron, and
I, were wandering through the shops
of Paris. Looking for a house gift to
placate his wife who could not accom-
pany him on the trip, he was intrigued
by a Napoleonic Drum which he saw
in one of the shops. While sitting at
home one night, Jack Aaron’s family
were suddenly startled to hear him
shout “Eureka.” The result you know
— he found the right metal container,
he found the artist who could wield
his brush with deft, sure stroke — and
now, this year, Sherry’s proudly pre-
sents its hand-painted Napoleonic
Drum.

I am one of those wine lovers (per-
haps you are, too), who somehow man-
ages to collect more bottles in his
household than he has room for. Be-
cause of this untenable situation, we
have been on a continuous search for a

wine bin that is practical, attractive,
and not overly expensive. At last. we
think the solution has been found —
you can see it for yourself, just turn
to the photograph of the JAMES
BEARD WINE RACK on page 3
of this catalog. This rack, made of fine
sturdy wood with blonde finish. can
fit readily into the closet of the smallest
apartment or can be built up like
children’s blocks to make an impres-

sive cellar in the large country home,
Certainly, a dozen bottles .of wine
tucked away in this rack would make
a most original Christmas gift to your
wine drinking friends—just pick dozen
wines and add 4.95 for cost of rack.
