“f Probably the most popular red wine in our
shop. Light hearted and carefree. This
fine Brouilly makes the transition from warm
weather entertaining to fall and winter dining with ease. Just

about the best bottle of Beaujolais to be found here -or in France.

MORGON, CHATEAU DE BELLEVUE 1974, Princess Lieven 3.99
Richer, deeper than the average Beaujolais. Close to Burgundy
in style and depth.
