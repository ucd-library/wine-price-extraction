ni, MEDOC OR ST. EMILION 1952 (Albert Freres). =. . 2. cw, 7 11.50
Two pleasant little Clarets — not great wines, but typical of the Bordeaux district names which they bear. Both are excellent
for all round table wines.
Bottle Case
oul CAIATEAU BAHANS HAUT BRION 1950 (Craves) . . ... 2... LZ 19.95
Grown and Chateau bottled at Chateau Haut Brion. A unique opportunity to acquire a claret of stature at modest sale cost.
At Chateau Haut Brion they now follow the practice of segregating the grapes produced from younger vines and then bottling
the wines produced under the name of Chateau Bahans Haut Brion. The result is a wine of great breed, somewhat lighter than
Chateau Haut Brion, more quick to mature, and less costly.
Bottle Case
doe SI. JULIEN 1947 (Louis Eschenauer) i. . 6 ee ae 81.49
One of the most highly regarded names among Bordeaux shippers is that of Louis Eschenauer. After tasting his remarkable
1947 St. Julien we persuaded him to send us 25 cases. In the same shipment also came several cases of his Margaux 1947 at
$1.94 the bottle, $20.95 the case.
1949 CHATEAU BOTTLED CLARETS
WE ARE ENTIRELY CONVINCED THAT THE GREAT 1949 CLARETS WILL EITHER BE
UNAVAILABLE NEXT YEAR OR VERY EXPENSIVE. SINCE ITS EARLIEST GREAT SUC.
CESSOR IS 1952 WHICH WILL NOT BE READY TO DRINK FOR SEVERAL YEARS. WE
STRONGLY URGE THAT YOU ACQUIRE SOME OF THE EXTRAORDINARY 1949’s LISTED
BELOW WHILE THE OPPORTUNITY STILL EXISTS.

Important Fall news! In the Spring, Ayala Brut 1949 sold for $5.95 and was exceptional value at that level. At $4.99 it repre-
sents a unique opportunity for those who want top flight, well balanced, world famous vintage Champagne at modest cost.

Perhaps once in a decade the impeccable Champagne maker, Mme. Bollinger, produces a wine that becomes a classic among
connoisseurs — it happened in 1928, again in 1937, and now in 1947. At a recent dinner in the Champagne district, Mme. Bollin-
ger informed our associate, Jack Aaron, that she considers her 1947 superior to either her 1928 or 1937. Considering that both of
these have enjoyed reputations of the highest magnitude, no one interested in Champagne at its best should overlook this oppor-
tunity to acquire the great Bollinger 1947, either for present drinking or laying down. Also available in half bottles and Magnums.
