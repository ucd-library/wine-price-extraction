We are offering a collection of 1959 Clarets on this page—
though they may appear expensive, they are, nevertheless,
phenomenally low in light of present replacement cost. But
we must assert, they are truly great, perhaps not as long-lived
as the 1961s—but they are wines of class, charm, and most can
be consumed today with much enthusiasm, and pleasure. Here
are the wines to drink for the next few years,if you are secking
a high point in claret, while you patients wait for the ’61s
to come around. And one thing {fs certain—you will be paying
considerably more for the ’59s a year or two hence,
REPORTS FROM BORDEAUX indi-

cate that 1963 was a disastrous year in

St. Emilion and Pomerol, and at best,

only reasonably good red wines, light

in body and color, were produced in ONE or

the Medoc. What has been the imme- »
diate result? The pleasing ’60s and °62s se GW S$
have already gone up 20% on the Bor- (eer
deaux market, and the astronomically oF ONE
high levels demanded for the 1959s and

1961s have become firm and some are werd ion
threatening to become $100 the case C
