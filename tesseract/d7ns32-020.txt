I read from my wine notes — “just tasted
the 1955 Beaujolais of the Domaine of
Ringuet. Here is wine that infallibly re-
calls the delicious young red wine, full of
fruit and charm, served with such en-
thusiasm at the better restaurants of
France. Beautifully balanced, light, fresh,
and disarmingly delightful.” This Beau-
jolais, the best I have tasted, bears no
more relation to the commercial variety
that I see all over New York, than Schloss
Johannisberger does to a mediocre Lieb-
fraumilch. And for only $16.95, you can
send a whole case that will keep the

taste buds sparkling through many a

dinner
