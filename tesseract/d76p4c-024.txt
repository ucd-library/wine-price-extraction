Burgundy’s wine shippers
hit by critical short supply

Louis Latour, the doyen of Burgundy’s wine shippers,
has been reduced to inviting foreign wine merchants to
lunch instead of to the usual autumn wine tasting. He
says he has virtually no wine to sell them. Burgundy is
facing a crisis of production.

Unlike Bordeaux, Burgundy is cramped in area and
thus in output, even in good years. And recent years
have not been good. In the 1970s there have only been
two outstanding vintages — 1971 and 1976. There were
some good wines produced in 1972, while 1973, ’74 and ’75
reds are best forgotten. The 1976 output was lush — but
so are the prices — over $20 a bottle to the trade for the
top names. Last year’s wines were a disappointing, de-
spite their absurdly high prices. The 1978 vintage will be
small, but the acidity and color are good.

Various tricks are being used to stretch the available
supplies. Enthusiastic Frenchmen drive out into the
country and fill their station wagons with wine bought
at the farmhouse door for cash with no documentation
changing hands. Sometimes the wines they are buying
are those that would otherwise go to the merchants.
Genuine high-class Burgundy is going to be very short.
Growers and merchants will use the 1978 wine to replen-
ish their own stocks; their customers will be rationed.

The Economist of London

Excellent, slow-to-mature wines which are just coming into their own
and will still enjoy another five to ten years of growth.

Robust and earthy, from one of the lesser-known villages of the
Cotes de Nuits, and therefore, less costly than other Burgundies

If one village on the Cotes de Nuits represents the essence of
great red Burgundy, it is surely Vosne-Romanee. Here is a
Premier Cru beauty. Noellat.

available.
