The Great 1959's

Here are some realities on the
wines of Bordeaux: (1) The °59s
because they were proclaimed
“The Vintage of the Century” are
almost completely unavailable on
the Bordeaux market; or, if found,
can only be acquired at stagger-
ingly-high prices. (2) The famed
Clarets of the 1959 vintage are not
just good but absolutely extra-
ordinary—whether you drink them
now or ten year’s hence. (3) The
charm, class and balance exhi-
bited reach a high point in Claret

drinking.

172 CHATEAU GRAND PUY
DUCASSE (Pauillac) ... . 2.99 32.30

Here is one of the reasons why Pierre Nicolas is one of the largest wine dealers in the
world, selling 650,000 bottles at retail per day! This superb Claret, rated as one of the
great Medoc growths in the 1855 classification was purchased in barrel by Nicolas in
1960, When ready for bottling, it was shipped to the Nicolas cellars in cask. The savings
were substantial. This sale price is based on Nicolas’ cost and not the present high
replacement in Bordeaux which would result in a price more than double this. Drink
truly great Claret and save substantially.

200 CHATEAU DUHART MILON 2.99 32.30

This vineyard was recently acquired mT Chateau Lafite Rothschild. Nicolas purchased
this wine from the previous owner at low cost and bottled it in his own Paris cellars.
This _ is based on low acquisition cost and not on the fantastically high level it
would command in today’s market.

129 CHATEAU LYONNAT (St. Julien) . 3.99 43.10

The wines of St. Julien are similar in characteristics to those of Pauillac to the north
— those of Margaux to the south. They tend to have that delicacy associated with
argaux.

272 CHATEAU BRANAIRE-DUCRU
(St. Julien). . . . . 449 48.50

Located just across the vineyard road from Chateau Beychevelle. This sturdy wine
remains the best produced in St. Julien.

696 CHATEAU PICHON LONGUEVILLE,
LALANDE (Pauillac) ... . . 5.99 64.70

Enjoys the high rank of second growth Medoc, 1855 classification. Owned by our good
friend, Mr. Miaihle, a stellar alumnus of the Harvard School of Business Administration,
who also owns St. Marcgeaux Champagne, Chateau Siran, and part-owner of Chateau
Palmer. A classic wine similar in characteristics to Chateau Latour, its neighbor.

182 CHATEAU LEOVILLE
LASCASES (St. Julien). . . . 6.29 67.95

Dr. Peynaud, Professor of Oenology at the University of Bordeaux is the one who
created the metamorphosis in Leoville Lascases which started in the 1959 vintage.
The vines and the method of viniculture were improved upon. The exquisite delicacy
and balance you will detect when you taste this wine is the result.

Bottled in the Paris cellars of Nicholas.

724 CHATEAU CALON SEGUR
(St.Estephe) ... . 6.49 70.10

Hailed the best of all the third growths, and better than most seconds Marquis de
Segur stated “I make more wine at Lafite and Latour but my heart is at Calon”—
therefore you see a heart on the label. Incidentally, this same Marquis also owned
Lafite and Latour at that time.

732 CHATEAU BEYCHEVELLE
(it, Ses - es ~ OPO -7ESO

Perhaps this wine is the favorite of England simply because the proprietor, Monsieur
Achille Fould is a distinguished graduate of Oxford University and he has visited
London frequently. It is now in vogue in America, The harmonious lightness and
delicacy are the distinguishing characteristics.

5056 CHATEAU LA MISSION oe
HAUT BRION (Graves) . . . .10.95 118.00

A great of the Graves district. Located across the road from Chateau Haut Brion, The
price is always higher than any of the Medoc second growths and just below the great
first growths. This distinction is earned by the extraordinary quality of the wine.

756 CHATEAU LATOUR (Pauillac) . .12.95 140.00
The soil at Chateau Latour is truly unique—two oxen are required to draw a plough
through it. It is from this difficult soil that this remarkable, full-bodied, rich and
distinguished wine is born. A classic long-lived wine that has decades of great life ahead
of it,

722 CHATEAU MOUTON
ROTHSCHILD (Pauillac) . . . 15.00 162.00

This wine is classified as a second growth. Since this did not please Mouton, the motto
was created: “First, I cannot be—I do not deign to be second—I am Mouton”. The
Rothschilds really carried out this motto because now Mouton commands the highest
prices on the Bordeaux market. A great 1959.

153 CHATEAU HAUT
BRION (Graves). . . . . . .16.50 178.00

Our good friends, Seymour Weller and Jean Delmas, who are res onsible for the
present excellence of Chateau Haut Brion consider their 1959 one of the most remark-
able examples of great Claret ever produced at their vineyard. Here we have one of
the greatest Red Wines of our generation.

423 CHATEAU LAFITE
ROTHSCHILD (Pauillac) .. .24.50 264.00

The price here staggers us. We presume it will have the same effect on you. Our only
defense is that the wine costs us over $20.00 the bottle, and will probably cost us over
$30.00 the bottle by next November. If you want the greatest and are not frightened
by the price, now is your opportunity.

533 CARRUADES DE CHATEAU
LAFITE ROTHSCHILD (Pauillac)
IN DOUBLE MAGNUM . . .._ .37.00 99.65

Here we have not just a two-bottle size, the Magnum, but the four-bottle size of
Double Magnum. Don’t buy it unless you have a dinner party consisting of at least
ten people. But if you do want to have a festive evening, buy this giant bottle holding
great wine at astonishingly low cost. It brings it below $10.00 the bottle and it is from
the great Chateau Lafite Rothschild,
