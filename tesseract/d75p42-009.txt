ROAST SADDLE OF VENISON
A LA BOURGUIGNONNE

The Saddle is the double loin. Ask to
have it tied together at the ends of the thin
section so that the fillets on the under side
of the bone are protected. The strings
should not show on the upper surface of
the saddle. If you are deft with the needle,
you can pique the saddle with small strips
of larding pork. You will need a small
larding needle and strips of larding pork
about 14 inch square and about 4 inches
long. These should be run through the
saddle in regular fashion—about 3 rows
of them. They should extend from the sur-
face about 1 inch on each end and be uni-
formly placed. This is entirely optional
and if you are not used to doing such
things, forget it. However, I think you
should marinate the saddle for a day.

2 medium onions berries (they may

thinly sliced be bought that way
1 carrot sliced rather now)
thinly 1 teaspoon freshly

1 clove garlic ground black

1 bay leaf pepper

1 teaspoon thyme \%, cup olive oil

8 crushed juniper 114 cups red wine

Combine all these ingredients and heat
them just to the boiling point. Place the
saddle in a deep bowl or dish and pour the
hot marinade over it. Turn well and allow
to marinate, turning several times for 12
to 24 hours. Remove the saddle and dry.
Strain the marinade and heat it. Place the
saddle on a rack in a roasting pan and
place in a 450° oven for 25 minutes. Baste
once during that time with a little of the
marinade. Reduce the heat to 325° and
continue roasting, allowing approximately
12 to 15 minutes per pound. The internal
temperature, when tested with a meat
themometer should be about 130°. Baste
several times with the strained marinade.
Salt well about ten minutes before remov-
ing from oven. Remove the saddle to a
hot platter after removing all the strings
used in tying it on the underside. Let it
rest for 10 minutes. Pour off the juices and
skim off any excess fat. Rinse the pan with
a little red wine or port and pour into the
sauce boat with the pan juices.

 

Surround the roast with the garniture
and send to table. Carve in long, thin slices
parallel to the center bone. Serve with
some of the garniture and chestnut purée.

GARNITURE A LA BOURGUIGNONNE

5 slices lean salt pork Juice of 1 lemon—
freshened and cutin 1 teaspoon lemon
thin slivers juice

4tablespoons butter Salt, pepper

24 tiny white onions, Additional broth,
peeled optional

2 teaspoons sugar 2 tablespoons chopped

Salt, freshly ground parsley
black pepper ¥4 teaspoon freshly

24 smallish mushroom ground black
caps, fluted or not pepper

1¥4 cups broth Butter

Soak pork in cold water half hour. Re-
move and dry. Cut into strips and brown
in butter till well dried out and delicately
colored. Remove to an absorbent towel.
Add the onions to the fat—adding more
butter if needed. Cook slowly, shaking the
pan from time to time till onions begin to
brown lightly. Sprinkle with sugar and
shake well in pan to give them additional
color. While the onions are browning,
blanch the mushrooms in broth, adding
lemon juice. When they are just blanched,
drain on absorbent paper and combine
with the onions. Add a little broth and let
the mushrooms and onions simmer for a
few moments together before adding salt
pork sections and parsley. Correct the
seasoning and stir in 2 or 3 tablespoons of
butter and blend thoroughly. Spoon
around the saddle.

BRAISED ROMAINE

6 small heads of Salt
romaine, well Freshly ground black
trimmed pepper

14% cups broth or 18 slices marrow

bouillon Broth
6 tablespoons butter

Trim the romaine heads which should
not be large ones. If they seem extra large,
trim off some of the outside leaves. Steam
them in a deep skillet or saute pan with
broth. Heat to boiling point, cover the pan
and steam for 5 minutes. Remove cover
and turn the heads and continue cooking
over medium heat till the heads of the ro-
maine are just tender. Do not cook them
till they are stringy and too mushy. Re-
move to absorbent paper to drain. Pour

 

off the broth and use it for other purposes
or discard it completely. You may use it
to poach the marrow if you wish. Melt
butter in pan and when it is bubbling add
the romaine and sear on all sides very
quickly. Salt and pepper to taste and ar-
range on a hot serving dish.

Poach the marrow in broth for just a
few minutes to heat through and to soften
the marrow. Arrange marrow slices on
each head of romaine.

CHESTNUT PUREE

I find that the tinned chestnuts in brine
from France are perfect for this purée—
no need to struggle with the fresh chest-
nuts and peel and scrape them. Be sure
you buy those in brine and not the ones
in syrup.

2 1514 oz. tins
chestnuts in brine

14 cups milk Parisienne

1 teaspoon salt 1 stick—'4 pound

\%4 teaspoon freshly butter

ground black A few spoonfuls

pepper heavy cream
A pinch of quatre

Spices or Spice
Island Spice

Drain the canned chestnuts well and let
water run over them to remove all the
brine. Place in a smallish saucepan with
the milk, salt, pepper and spice and let
them heat slowly till they have absorbed
a good deal of the milk.

Drain and purée the chestnuts and re-
turn to a saucepan with butter and blend
lightly and heat through thoroughly. Cor-
rect the seasoning and fold a few spoons
of heavy cream before serving. Serve very
hot.

SORBET AU CHAMPAGNE

You may do this in an electric freezer or
in trays in the refrigerator, as you wish. If
you are a large group, better double this
recipe.

14 cup sugar Grated rind of 1
2 cups water orange
14 cup orange juice V4, bottle Champagne

Cook sugar and water together to a roll-
ing boil. Boil hard for 6 minutes. Remove
from the heat and stir in the orange rind,
orange juice and Champagne. Bring to
boil again. Cool slightly and pour into
freezing trays and place in freezer. When
there is a solid 1 inch layer of frozen sher-
bet in the tray, transfer to a bow! and stir
with a fork till mushy. Return to tray and
refreeze.

This may also be frozen in an electric
freezer packed with salt and ice.
