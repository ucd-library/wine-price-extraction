YEAR OF

VINTAGE BOTTLE

   

Whatever the occasion, if a particular year is to be commemorated,
no gift can prove as exciting, imaginative or thoughtful as a bottle
of fine old Vintage Port proudly carrying on its label THE YEAR.

These Vintage Ports trace their ancestry to the extraordinary
cellars of Richard Hooper & Sons in Oporto — part of a collec-
tion that is reputed to be the most remarkable of all Europe. The
reputation of Hooper’s was of such exceptional merit to earn the
warrant as Port purveyors to the British House of Lords as far
back as 1912 — no mean accomplishment in a country that boasts
of having the most discriminating and serious Port imbibers in
the world.

One of the noblest of the world’s great wines is undoubtedly an
authentic Vintage Port that has achieved its maturation, like fine
still wine, in bottle rather than in cask. If you have not experienced
its vinous joy, we strongly advise that you acquire some for your
own pleasure.
