THE EXCELLENT 1973 RHINES AND MOSELLES
Bottle Case

 

PIESPORTER MICHELSBERG, W. Dunweg Bey, 2oeOo
Not even the thriftiest of the Moselle Burgermeisters can buy a wine

of this caliber and excellence for a price as low as $2.59. This will

disappear quickly - suggest you anticipate your spring needs now.

JOHANNISBERGER ERNTEBRINGER, Winzergenossenschaft Zod PD) 55)
Famous little Rheingau wine village which is proud of its castle

vineyard, Schloss Johannisberg. Look for grace and breed with

fine bouquet.

ZELTINGER HIMMELREICH, W. Dunweg 2e99 34.10
— Utterly delicious! Here is a Moselle

from a renowned vineyard produced

during the excellent 1973 vintage.

Light, dry, with haunting bouquet.

Anticipate warm weather needs now -

 

and save.

RUDESHEIMER BURWEG, Winzergenossenschaft Dia oe, 34.10
Often the Rudesheimers prove the best of the whole Rheingau. In

1973, wines grown along the steep Rudesheimer hills reached a

richness that was never achieved by its neighboring villages.

MUSCADET 1975, Debreuil 2.89 S2E95
Dry, light, easy to drink. In a day when white wine is being

substituted for the martini before dinner, here is a logical,

low-cost alternative .

MUSCADET~SUR-LIE 1975, Chateau de Briace DIY, 34.10
"Sur-Lie’ means that the wine never left the original barrel and the

contents were taken out from above, leaving the lees behind. This

is a more costly and wasteful process,

but the result is that you get Muscadet

beauty with more intense flavor. This

beauty is estate-bottled by Chateau de

Briace and won First Award in a recent

blind tasting among Muscadets which

was held in Paris.

Chateau de La Chaize is
considered by wine authorities
to produce possibly the best
single example of fruity, well balanced red wine, produced in the soil of
Beaujolais. This 1975 has won three Gold Awards - at the Paris, Macon,
and Brussels Fairs - as the best within its class. The Chateau de La Chaize
vineyard in the famed wine-growing district of Brouilly has been maintained
from father to son for three centuries by the Marquis de Roussy de Sales family.

SARAN NATURE STILL CHAMPAGNE

A rarity from the 18th century Chateau of Moet & Chandon
Presented in the graceful Dom Perigon bottle

 

IN ITS OWN QUIET WAY, unheralded by the sound of popping corks,
Chateau de Saran reflects the heart of the Champagne district. It is
produced from only the best Pinot Chardonnay grapes. Its elegance
is dramatic - extreme dryness married with wonderful fruitiness - this is

non=sparkling Champagne at its best!

For decades, SARAN NATURE was legally prohibited by French edict
from being exported. Only for the past year has it been possible for
New Yorkers to share its distinction with Frenchmen who are imbibing
it proudly and joyously at such gastronomic shrines as Maxim's, Mere
Charles, Taillevent, Troisgros, Paul Bocuse, Michel Guerard, Moulin
de Mougins, and L'Oasis.

SARAN NATURE, a true rival of Montrachet for the dry white crown
of France, is produced in limited quantity. It is rationed in France,
and the shipment to America is pitifully small. We are happy to be
able to offer it to you so you can share its crisp dryness, elegance,
haunting bouquet and perfect balance with the sophisticated and

anar appreciative wine drinkers of Paris.
