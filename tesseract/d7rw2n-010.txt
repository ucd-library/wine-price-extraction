THE “HOLIDAY HANDBOOK”
Of French Wines

Frank Schoonmaker was a brave man
indeed to undertake explaining
French wines within the scope of only
a few pages. In our opinion, his article
is delightfully written and provides a
few nuggets of wisdom to even the
most advanced student of French
wines.

We believe that this article will stim-
ulate many of you to probe more
widely among the great wines of
France. We therefore asked Mr.
Schoonmaker to suggest several
“Sampler Assortments” to enable you
to appraise some of the more inter-
esting wines, right in your own home.
