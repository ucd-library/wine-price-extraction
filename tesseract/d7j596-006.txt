1959 SS

CN S aAL—

The effect of the title “Vintage of the Century” which has
been bestowed on the 59s, has created enough buying pres-
sure to denude the cellars, despite the large crop. Most were
soundly made, are perfect today and display great charm
and delicacy. If you want to drink great red Burgundy,
vibrantly alive with fruit and charm, drink these for the
next few years—and you will match wine pleasure of a pre-
vious generation, who were equally lucky with the 1934s—
a vintage similar in its character.
