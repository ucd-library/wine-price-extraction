IMPORTANT WINE NEWS!

 

oS Eight of Italys Best WINES Arriving
in New YorK Early in December!

Many of our friends travelling in Italy have come back with glowing reports of little local
Italian wines, bemoaning that none of them were available in the United States. We decided
to do something about it. So we asked FRANK SCHOONMAKER to give us a complete on-the-
spot report on the wines of Italy. For weeks he travelled through all of the important wine
growing districts, visited scores of vineyards, tasted from early morning to dusk and came out

with these eight wines which he proclaims as among Italy’s finest.

Each of them originates from a specific, fine vineyard, is estate bottled by the owner and
carry the authenticity associated with the Chateau Bottled and Estate Bottled wines of France.
None of these wines quite achieve the depth of flavor of the greatest wines of Bordeaux or
Burgundy, but each is well balanced, delightful and possessed with much character. There are
not many vineyards in France that can easily surpass either the “Soave or the “Barolo”. If
you are curious about the better wines of Italy, don’t deny yourself this opportunity to appraise

them at their very best.

ITALIAN WHITE WINES

Estate Bottled, Scala fu Raffaele. The enchanting little island of Capri, in the Bay
of Naples, has been known to generations of travelers for its unforgettable land-
scapes, its flowers, its famous “Blue Grotto” ... and its dry white wine.

CORVO DI CASTELDACCIA 1950

Estate Bottled, Duca de Salaparuta. For nearly a hundred and forty years Corvo has
been produced on the estate of the Dukes of Salaparuta at Casteldaccia outside
Palermo. It has won awards and medals in every country from France to Australia
and from Austria to Peru . . . including, last but not least, the United States.

WAR ee es

Estate Bottled, Cantina Sociale di Soave. Soave’s wine, green-gold, dry, fresh, at its
best when young, is generally shipped in tall slender bottles like those used for
Alsace, and the wines of the Moselle. It certainly ranks as one of Italy’s best white
wines, and as one of the pleasantest produced anywhere — hardly great, but refresh-
ing and delightful and eminently “suave”, it is good with almost any dish.

ITALIAN PINK WINES
CHIARELLO ROSE 1952 -

Estate Bottled, Conte Campostrini. This gay and fragrant little wine is as captivating
as the country from which it comes — the lovely, smiling shores of Lake Garda,
some twenty miles west of Verona, in Northern Italy. Literally Chiarello (pro-
nounced Key-ar-ello) means “the little clear one”, or “the little light colored one”,
in Italian; it is one of many affectionate terms used to designate a pink or rose wine.
And here is a rose which can fairly be described as Italy’s best.

ITALIAN RED WINES
FREISA 1952 _..

Estate Bottled, Antiche Cantine Tenuta Galarey. The province of Piedmont, or
“Foot-of-the-Mountain”, (for its name means precisely that in Italian) is bounded
on the north by the Alps and Switzerland and on the west by the Alps and France.

It is Italy’s most important wine-producing area and its red wines, on the whole,
are about Italy’s best.

BARDOLINO 1952 vee es gee ne tie

Estate Bottled, Conte Campostrini. The vineyards of Bardolino, some twenty miles
west of Verona, overlook the magnificent lower basin of Lake Garda, and command
one of the loveliest views in Europe. The wine, clear ruby in color, rather light in
body, soft and fruity and fine, is as charming as the countryside from which it comes.

VALPOLICELLA SUPERIORE 1950 | jt :
Estate Bottled, Sociale di Valpolicella, The Valpolicella vineyard are a few miles
northwest of Verona (city of Romeo and Juliet) on the foothill slopes of the Alps.

This lovely light red wine is perhaps the most charming of all Italy, at its best
when still young.

BAROLO 1945 _. as Bie ok. i jornd tans eicwathcaaald.
Estate Bottled, Antiche Cantine Tenuta Galarey. Full-bodied, sturdy, long-lived,
slow to mature, Barolo ranks beyond doubt or question as Italy’s finest wine. When
made by a scrupulous grower in a great year, it can hold its own against practically
all comers, including many celebrated French Burgundies and the famous reds of

the Rhone Valley, It comes from South Piedmont some 40 miles from Turin and
only about 60 miles from the French border.
