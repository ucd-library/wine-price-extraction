This handsome wicker holds a
full gallon of red wine, which is
equal to five regular bottles, av-
eraging out well under $1 the
bottle. It is not ordinary red wine,
but some of the good red wine of
Spain. Even after the contents
are consumed and enjoyed, the
handsome bottle remains as an
attractive and primitive decora-
tive piece.

thusiastically and copiously. This
handsome wicker gallon holds
the equivalent of five regular
bottles. A most pleasing light red
wine. Available in red or white.
