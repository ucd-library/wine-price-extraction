ALSATIAN WINES...
Revularl Bottle Case

S97 SYLVANER 1955 (Caves Hanhart). ... .. 149 20 4.60
Here is a typical Alsatian wine made from the Sylvaner grape—fresh, young,
exceptionally light and delightful. A perfect choice for “Spritzer”, terrace
dining, and picnic lunches.

454 REESLING. 1955 (Caves Hanhart)-. 2 ..... .. 159 2.48 16 34
Riesling is one of the two greatest of all white wine grapes and particularly
thrives among the steep hills of Alsace, where it produces a dry wine of
unusual charm. Here is an excellent example at a price that will permit
serving freely this summer.

476 GEWURZTRAMINER 1955 (Caves Hanhart) Continued 1.79 19.95
The most highly regarded grape of the district is the Gewurztraminer which
yields a wine not quite as dry as the Riesling, but with a bouquet that is
more prominent and more highly perfumed. This wine would be an excep-

STENDAY We herald this remarkable Alsatian wine as the best single example of white
wine we have ever tasted from the district. An extraordinary 1955 that can

rank with the great vineyards of the Rheingau. Enthusiastically recom-
mended for those who want superb Alsatian wine—you will be amazed
by its stature and breed.

MAY WINE...
606 GERMAN MAY WINE (Gebrueder Lob) . . . 1.79 1.29 14.50

One of the most provocative aromas in the garden during the spring is one
which few people associate with drinking. They inhale the fresh, tingling
aroma of the woodruff plant, but never quite associate it with the bouquet
of “May Wine”. This one has just reached us from the Rhine—we opened
a bottle and were intrigued by the garden-fresh tang which greeted us, the
smell of woodruff. We happily inform you that is costs but $1.29—a delight-
ful and inexpensive wine to serve chilled as an aperitif during the coming
warm days.

AUSTRIAN WINES...
446 GUMPOLDSKIRCHNER SPATLESE 1953... . . 1.79 19.33

of Austria: one of the country’s best. Estate bottled by G. Juch.

Ps LOMNER KAISERVEIN 1955...
This famous Austrian wine of the district of Loiben on the banks of the
Danube, proudly bears the name of Emperor Franze Josef, who drank it
consistently and referred to it frequently as his favorite wine. Soft, delightful
bouquet, spritely dry white wine.

F11 GRINZINGER PRAELATENWEIN AUSLESE 1953. . 2,49 27.00

Estate Bottled, Benedictine Abbey Schotten of Vienna. Knowing travelers

yard owned by the Benedictine Abbey of Vienna.

fying and there are half bottles at only 54¢ each, 13.00 the case of 24.
