quantities of the ’70s and ‘66s. Older vintages of stature can
only be obtained by persuasion and appealing to the generosity
of the chateau owners. The authentic survivors of great vintage
years listed below provide testimony to our persuasive powers.
We present these jewels to you proudly and on a rationed basis.
