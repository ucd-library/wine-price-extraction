Bottle Case

COTES UU RHONE 3964, Talleyrand ©... 2. 02.050 ce 1.39 15.00

Here is the kind of wine served en carafe in the better country inns along the Paris-Riviera route. There is no
pretense here to greatness, but, nevertheless, it is a sound, light, entirely agreeable red table wine—especially in
warm weather. Half bottles at 84¢, $18.00 the case.

CEA LEAUNEUP DU PAPE 1961, PONDTOs 5-00.00 se 2.49 26.90
Estate bottled by the highly regarded Clos de Felibres. 1961 is an exceedingly great vintage, showing a wonderful

balance and great class.

GHATEAUNEUF DU PAPE 1952, R. Abielle ... .. 06.005 3.79 40.95

1952 was an exceedingly great year in the Rhone. This wine is splendid today and shows no trace of old age.
Worth much more if intrinsic merit were the only criterion.

Fie re eo MOINES 1062 6 a ee ete 3.79 40.95
From a single, steep spectacular terraced hillside some 50 miles south of Lyon. George Saintsbury describes this
as ‘the manliest wine.’ Unquestionably the best single vineyard of Hermitage. Can compete with even the greatest
of the red Burgundies. Quantity limited.
