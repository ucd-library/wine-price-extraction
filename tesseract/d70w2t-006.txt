Beaujolais performed well in 1967—the wines were rich in fruit and endowed with the charming purple-red
color and showed some of the fragrance of a grape arbor. Most of them will not be shipped until summer,
however we are happy to offer you here The ‘Wine of the Year’—the young Beaujolais, the wine they are
drinking in Paris today. Delightful in its disarming freshness. Buy enough to carry you through the summer.

You will be pleased with its charm.

BEAUJOLAIS—1966 VINTAGE

The best for present drinking. Beaujolais like the 1967 above has a life that is counted in months rather than
years. However, the great townships of Beaujolais such as Moulin-a-Vent and Fleurie require more bottle
age to reach their peak. We list some oustanding examples below from Brouilly, Chiroubles, Morgon,
Chenas, Fleurie and Moulin-a-Vent. They are the prime examples from this popular wine-growing area.

Among the best we have ever tasted are those of the Rt. Hon. Ernest Marples, who has earned special
admiration not only for his wine but as a Member of the British Cabinet and as its Minister of Transport.

His wines are listed below. They represent the best of their class.
