Rather than Scotch, Vodka, Gin and Bourbon—it has become
a current vogue to serve aperitif wines as a light-hearted prel-
ude to the summer repast. Several interesting pre-mealtime
aperitifs suited for warm weather living are listed below.

1400 LA SEINE in 33% oz. Litre (France) ...... 3.49 37.70

If you like Dubonnet, Byrrh or Raphael—you will adore LA
SEINE. Here is the authentic red-colored aperitif, bottled in
France, capturing the spirit of the sidewalk cafe and relais.
The price is astonishingly low in light of the generous size
bottle and quality of its contents..

1414 VIN DE CASSIS (Sisca) ......--.-------: 3.59 38.77
Sisca also makes a Creme de Cassis, only slightly stronger in
alcohol, that sells for about $8.50. This one, based on our com-
parative tastings, is its equal at less than half the price. Suggest
you get this excellent French product—keep a bottle in town
and at your vacation address—and you are prepared to immedi-
ately pour it over ice cream, make Cassis Sorbet, add it to
white wine to make your own Kir or Vin Blanc Cassis. Also
excellent if you add’an ounce to a glass of Dry Vermouth.

1398 KIR GALLIQUE (France) .......--------: 3.49 37.69
Kir Gallique—a happy harmony of dry white wine and Cassis
has taken New York by storm during recent months. Simply
keep in your refrigerator and serve—the ideal aperitif.

1401 LILLET (france) .....-.--.+)-.- 4.19 45.25
Pale in color, relatively dry. Among the most popular of the
aperitifs in both Paris and New York. ($3.99 bottle)

Gratifying indeed to the economy-minded wine lover, the ex-
cellent dry white wines of Alsace have not followed the up-
ward price graph of other areas of France. Buy them now
while they are still bargains—ideally suited for the beach house
or hillside retreat.

fragrant and flowery bouquet of the-Gewurtztraminer grape ap-
parent here. J. Muller.
