WHITE BORDEAUX WINE

GLENFIDDICH UNBLENDED
SINGLE-MALT 10 YR. WHISKY

WHAT IS MALT WHISKY? Sir
Robert Bruce Lockhart refers to
malt whisky as ‘‘a liquid gift
which exalts the soul’ and “‘goes
down singing hymns.” For those
who prefer less impassioned
judgments, the original unblended
Scotch whisky, made only of malt,
remaining untouched for many
long years, has a distinction and
superiority of its own. Some claim
it is the local water that makes
the difference. Others the local
peat. Whatever it is, a single-malt,
like a fine old cognac, has its own
singular character.

The best of the malts come from
the Highlands and the best sec-
tion is Banffshire, where Glenfid-
dich is made. The heart of Glen-
fiddich is clearly in the right
place.

Despite the pedigree, the price is
not staggering—it sells for below
13.00. We urge that you try it and
you will share our enthusiasm—
we also think you should consider
sending it to appreciative friends
who want to experience un-
blended Scotch whisky at its best.

In his Encyclopedia, Frank Schoonmaker states, “Chateau
Bouscaut is one of the most important and best-tended vineyards
of the Graves district, south of Bordeaux.” It was classified in
1953 among the eleven top Graves vineyards making red wines
—a classification that also includes Chateau Haut-Brion and
Chateau La Mission Haut-Brion.

In the London Observer, Cyril Ray, one of Britain’s leading
wine Critics, states, “On two or three occasions recently, I have
tasted current vintages of Chateau Bouscaut, a fine full-bodied,
but far from heavy wine grown on a famous property only a five
mile bus ride from the center of Bordeaux. Chateau Bouscaut is
typical of a red Graves in developing more quickly than a com-
parable Médoc, yet lasting as long.” :

Happy to add our own enthusiasm for Bouscaut (owned by a
group of wine-loving Americans), we present here a collection
of some of the Chateau’s recent, elegant vintages.
