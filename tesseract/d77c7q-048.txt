 

Large bottles of outstanding
red wine are hard to come by
because many vineyards will
not go through the excep-
tional care and effort re-
quired. Because Ot their

scarcity, the time to acquire them is in the Summer, while they are still in our cellars, rather than
wait until the Fall or Winter when the ‘Big Bottle’ demand dramatically expands.

We still remember the intriguing reasons given to us by our friend, the late Gilbert Miller, who
always insisted on the magnum size or larger. We quote Mr. Miller, ‘Not only are big bottles more

impressive and festive, but the wines develop more slowly
bottle. And the wine steward thus makes fewer trips to t

and therefore will live longer in the larger
he table since he gets more glasses out

of each bottle — and not unimportantly, the temptation to pilfer is reduced because who can conceal

such large bottles under his coat?”
