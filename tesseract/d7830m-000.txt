| FE CAN THINK of no pleasanter way to

} greet the mid-summer season than to alert

by you to some of our ‘favorites’ ~ those bot-

i Li tles in our cellar that we consider particu-

\— = = i larly riotable—bottles that can bring added
pleasure to summer living.

Some of you may now be many miles from New
York, but such a geographic hurdle, so easy of solution,
should not keep you from the joy of outstanding expe-
riences in tasting.

If youare escaping the summer's heat in Long Island
or Westchester, there is no problem at all — in almost
every instance you can count on next day delivery,
without charge, via United Parcel Service.

A. Should you be farther afield in New York State,
whether it be along the Canadian Border, Fisher's
Island, or deep in the Adirondacks, your selections can

os easily reach you within three days (and we pleasantly
report that there is no charge for this speedy service
~ on any order over $35).

We believe that the wines and spirits ultimately

=~. chosen here, whether it be the young, fruity, purple
red 1955 Beaujolais, The Moselles, the Scotches, or
the 1938 Bourbon, are worthy representatives of their
class ~ honest values ~ and, in many instances —~ sen-
sational bargains.
