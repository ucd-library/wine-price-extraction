KESSELSTATT TREASURE CELLAR PUT IN THEIR FIRST NEW YORK APPEARANCE!

    
    
   
   
   
   
    
   
  

Whenever a vintage year in a Moselle is particularly outstanding (such as 1949, and now again
in 1953) the Counts of Kesselstatt set aside their most favorite wine into a special reserve
called the Schatzkeller or ''Treasure Cellar".

It was the 1949 Piesporter Goldtropfchen that Chancellor Adenauer, a "kenner" of Moselles for
most of his seventy-nine years, chose as his favorite. In the opinion of our associate, Kenneth
Dean, who has just returned from an intensive tasting at Trier of the Kesselstatt Treasure

Cellar wines, the 1953 which is listed below may well turn out to have been the better one. In |
any event, whether you choose the Kaseler, the Piesporter or the Josephshofer, you may be sure ¥

of one thing - you will be drinking some of the most extraordinary white wine of our generation.

 

 

No. Bottle Case
583 KASELER HITZLAY FEINE AUSLESE 1953 4,49 49,75

The steep vineyards along the Ruwer, from whence this remarkable Moselle
comes, produced wines which have their own flower-like distinction and
charm. Here is an extraordinary Auslese that is unquestionably one of the
most extraordinary Ruwer wines produced during a great vintage year.

595 JOSEPHSHOFER FEINE AUSLESE 1953 4.99 57450
The Josephshofer vineyard, one of the giants of the Moselles, is entirely
owned by the Kesselstatt family. This 1953 is wholly remarkable, luxurious
and with a bouquet that is astounding.

589 PIESPORTER GOLDTROPFCHEN SPATAUSLESE 1953 4.99
Here is a wine that won a national prize medal
competing against all of the German wines of the
magnificent 1953 vintage. In the opinion of Kenneth
Dean, it was the outstanding wine that he tasted during

his vineyard tour of the Moselle Valley only this August.
Piesporter Goldtropfchen is ranked as one of Moselle's five
greatest vineyards and here it is at its very best.

 

ee ALSATIAN WINES
400 FLEUR D'ALSACE (F. Hugel) boo 14.26
Here is a wine that is aptly called 'Flower of Alsace" - made by F. Hugel,

the most famed of the Alsatian growers, it has the freshness, youth and
flowery charm associated with the wines of Alsace.

444 GEWURZTRAMINER, GRAND CRU, 1953 (F. Hugel) 60.89 731.43

In our opinion, the best Single white wine we have ever tasted from Alsace.

SPST TTT,

Here is an extraordinary 1953 that can hold its own with the great vineyards
of the Rhine.
