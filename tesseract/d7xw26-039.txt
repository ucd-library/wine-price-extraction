Only superior estate-bottlings listed below

Authentic, estate-bottled (Original-Abfullung) Rhines and Mo-
selles reach superb heights, and are possibly among the best
white wines produced anywhere on the globe. Even the less
expensive ones are well endowed with charm, fruit, freshness
and finesse. Although our cellars have an outstandingly fine
selection of regional German wines such as Liebfraumilch,
Moselblumchen, etc., we do believe we offer you a higher
standard of intrinsic excellence and lower cost by limiting our
list to estate-bottlings. It is true that the names are rather com-
plex, long, but there is great reward for the wine drinker if he
is willing to go through the effort of moving away from the
simpler, easier-to-remember appellations into vineyard names,
where the source is specific and outstanding.

Despite the upwards re-evaluation of the German mark, and
the devaluation of the dollar, we are happy to report that it is
possible for the dedicated wine drinker to obtain many exam-
ples of exceptional Rhines and Moselles here at below $4.00
the bottle. The 1970 vintage was copious and excellent, pro-
ducing clean, fine wines of much finesse, designed for drinking
either immediately or during the next two or three years.

The 1971 vintage, just arriving, brings the best news to Rhine
and Moselle enthusiasts since 1953! To prove our point, and
maintain objectivity, we quote from FRANK SCHOORM-
MAKER'S (the author of the book “The Wines of Germany”’)
current vintage chart, “1971. Without question the best year
since 1959 and perhaps more properly comparable to ’53, that
‘queen of vintages’ when perfect autumn weather plus a gener-
ous accession of the noble mold gave wines of unique elegance

and bouquet...”
