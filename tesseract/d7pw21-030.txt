ALL ON SALE

By Pak -SChoonnia ker

Wine lovers, by now, hardly need to be told how much difference there
is between a great chateau-bottled Claret and an ordinary regional wine
from the Bordeaux Country.

Most of us have learned, too, that comparable, striking differences exist
in other categories of wine as well...the splendid estate-bottlings from
the Cote d’Or have little or nothing in common with “shipper’s Burgundy”;
the Moselles and Rhines that carry the Original-Abfulling of a great pro-
ducer are a long, long way from commercial Liebfraumilch.

It would seem right and reasonable to suppose that parallel differences
can be found in the related field of spirits, and indeed they can. Those rare
Cognacs and even rarer Armagnacs which have been distilled, aged and
estate-bottled in France by small producers are, to say the least, com-
pletely in a class apart; the same thing is true of estate-bottled Fruit

No.

2109 MARC DE BOURGOGNE (Doudet-Naudin )

Brandies from Alsace-Mirabelle, Kirsch, Framboise, Marc from Bur-
gundy, and Pear Brandy from Avignon.

If spirits of this sort are not particularly well-known, this is because
they are exceedingly hard to find. In terms of quality they are simply
extraordinary. Nevertheless, surprisingly, they are not expensive. Bottled
by farmers, they are not dressed in an elaborate or fancy package—but
neither, for that matter, are the great chateau- and estate-bottled wines.
They are not nationally advertised, nor available everywhere. But if you
visit the most distinguished restaurants of France—the Pyramide (Point)
at Vienne, the Cote d’Or (Dumaine) at Saulieu, the Taillevent, among
many, in Paris, the Coq Hardi at Bougival, to name only a few... these are
the only spirits that you will find on the wine list.

Bottle Case

6.95 79.50

Doudet-Naudin is the scrupulous estate bottler who once gave us his “Forgotten Wine Cellar” which he sealed up before the war and opened up in front of the French tax

 

athorities after the war. Some of you may have enjoyed those fabulous 1934s and 1937s of Corton. This grower also makes a small quantity of Brandy for his own use, but
there is always an over-production of about ten or fifteen cases a year. It is from this source that we offer this aged “Marc de Bourgogne” which is truly excellent, and at a

| price that is the lowest that such a distinctive spirit has been offered in our memory. However, you must exercise patience, because the first shipment will only reach us
during mid-March.
