Rare, Irreplaceable

Vintage MADEIRA
ee From the

“The very existence, let alone the sheer perfection of these
vintage Madeiras, is an historic wine event—these 19th Century
Madeira have provided one of the great wine tasting experiences
of my life,” states James Beard.

Here is an unusual offering of four remarkable, authentic 19th
Century Vintage Madeiras. Each bottle is signed by a director of
the impeccable firm of Blandy certifying that the bottle con-
tains a genuine Madeira of the vintage stated. Most of these
vintage Madeiras have disappeared from our cellars, but these
four thoroughbreds remain. We suggest the acquisition of these
precious bottles while they are on sale during this period.

- EQUATOR

The scholarly Mr. Humbert was recently in America and he let us taste
his “EQUATOR SHERRY.” We were amazed by its depth of flavor, its
great distinction, its beautiful harmony and fullness combined with
dryness. Mr. Humbert beamed as he stated, “This is the prize of our
century-old ceHars—an aged wine that is as full as a 2

Cream Sherry and yet wonderfully dry—the modern $99
counterpart of those sherries we used to send on long Bottle
voyages and sailing vessels in the olden days.”

S1 WISDOM’S FINO PALMA . . 1.59 17.95
A magnificent example of bone dry, straw colored Sherry. This classic ‘Fino
Palma” has helped Wisdom & Warter achieve its great international reputation,
now a century old. An ideal aperitif when served slightly chilled. The equal of
many Finos that command $3.00 or more the bottle.

S2 WISDOM’S ROYAL
BROWN OLOROSO. . . 1.79 19.95

There are few wines produced in the world that quite achieve the rich, deep flavor,
or dark color depth of a fine Brown Sherry. Here is a typical, fully aged example.
Highly recommended between meals with fruit, nuts or cake, or as an after-dinner

dessert wine.

S3 WISDOM’S
AMONTILLADO FINO . . 1.99 22.65

As this name implies, a good Amontillado belongs to the Fino family, but they
acquire, certain different characteristics as they mature; the color becomes more
amber-like. As in the Finos, they are very dry, more nutty in flavor and develop
ereater body. Here is a perfect example of fine Amontillado that normally com-
mands well over $3.00 the bottle.

GOLDEN CREAM. ... . 2.49 27.95
Generally speaking, a top-flight Cream Sherry such as this is the oldest and most
luxurious of the wines found in the Bodegas of Jerez. Usually, a fine Cream Sherry
of a reputable firm commands $5.00 or more the bottle. It is no ordinary event to
obtain this medium dry, dramatically rich, wine for only $2.49. We urge that

you try it.
