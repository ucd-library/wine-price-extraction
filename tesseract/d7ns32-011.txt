Not only is Peter Dawson Rare Reserve Scotch
a treasure in itself (the average age of the whis-
key in this bottle is well over twenty years),
but it becomes doubly precious in this magnifi-
cent hand-cut lead crystal decanter. The de-
canter, made by Royal Brierley, is a superb
example of British glassware artistry.

Because of the hand skill required to make
these decanters, only a small quantity is avail-
able, each bottle bearing its own individual
number. If you are seeking a unique one bottle
Christmas gift, we suggest that you order now
to avoid disappointment due to depletion.
