FORTNUM & MASON’S 15 YEAR OLD COGNAC 9.95 7.95 91.50

Here is an interesting discovery. Just before World War II, Fortnum & Mason received several casks of fine Cognac. They
permitted these casks to remain untouched in London until last year when they were bottled. A small portion of this
choice, English Market Cognac, with the 15 year age statement on the label, reached our cellars. The quality is superb
and we recommend it to the Brandy connoisseur.

MARC DE BOURGOGNE, 8.95 7.95 91.50

Here is a flavorful, hearty Brandy, distilled from the grape pressings of the great Cote d’Or vineyards. Very little of it
is made, and the best (produced by small vineyard owners, generally for their own use) is hard to come by. We were

able to persuade Monsieur Clerget to part with ten cases of this, out of his personal reserve, and there is no possibility
of our being able to secure more.

MARC DE CHAMPAGNE... 8.95 7.95 91.50

As far as we know, this marks the first time that the exceptional “Marc” or Brandy, of the Champagne district has been

offered to the American public. This distillate, popular in the Champagne district, has unusual delicacy, bouquet and
interest.

ARMAGNAC (Domaine d’Ognoas) Made 1941 8.40 96.00

A truly remarkable unblended Armagnac, distilled back in 1941, it is indeed a discovery for those who want Brandy of
unique pedigree at modest cost. 100 proof, it is austere, bone dry and possessing an unusually pale color of its own, the
simple result of oak and time. Its natural proof of 100, achieved after 16 years of aging in the barrel is unreduced and
unchanged. This Armagnac offers the es hilaetiie experience of clean, fine, lasting bouquet, powerful flavour and unmis-
takable class associated with only the finest brandies.

SINGLE CASK UNBLENDED COGNAC .. . 9.98 9.45 108.00

Here is an Estate-bottled Cognac that was produced during a great vintage year (1929) in the most celebrated part of
the Cognac country. “Grand Fine Champagne.” It has remained in its unblended state in barrels from 1929 until the
present date. Cognac of this calibre is hard to come by because no more than a few small growers have the patience and
aptitude to put aside, year after year, a distillation of their outstanding vintages.
