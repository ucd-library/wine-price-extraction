COL COURBE V.S.E.P. COGNAC (In Crooked Neck Bottle) ...... 5.99 68.50

Our cost for this fine V.S.E.P. Cognac has gone up $10 the case during the last two years. And yet, we are intent in offering
our clientele this excellent Cognac, in its interesting crooked neck bottle, at tempting sale cost.

SAMUEL JOHNSON.” COFFEE HOUSE-COGNAG =. 6.49 74.00

Since Samuel Johnson always considered Brandy the “drink for heroes,” it is quite fitting that a Cognac bear his name in
appreciation of his appreciation. It comes from the best soil of the district—the “Grande Fine Champagne”—and is well
worth the $8.50 it should normally command.

AMBLEVILLE GRANDE FINE CHAMPAGNE COGNAC V.S.E.P..... 8.29 95.25

A superb Estate bottled Grande Fine Champagne at about the price of an ordinary Three Star Cognac. Will pass the after-
dinner test beautifully. Normally $8.95.

SINGLE CASK UNBLENDED COGNAC (1934 Vintage) .......... 9.49 108.00

We are down to our last 23 cases of this authentic Estate bottled Cognac, and probably will not get any more until December.
Every drop is of the 1934 vintage and it expresses the authority, balance and true distinction of an unblended Cognac. Based
on higher replacement costs, it will probably be $12 the bottle next year.

HINE: FAMILY RESERVE COGNAC (.....).)...3.23..45.-.. =: 19.95 227.00

Since the early 19th Century, it has been the custom of the Hine family to set aside the best Cognac produced during a par-
ticularly outstanding year for their own use, ultimately to be served to honored guests. Only recently, and for the first time,
Francois Hine, the managing director of this venerable firm, has consented to part with a few of these treasured bottles—
each is numbered and bears a back label relating the unique history of the contents, hand signed by a director. Normally
$24.95. Quantity limited.
