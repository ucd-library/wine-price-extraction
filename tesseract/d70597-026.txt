1970 VINTAGE

The 1970 white Burgundies proved elegant, graceful, fruity, of
excellent balance with an observable tendency towards quick
development. They might be considered a happy synthesis of
‘66 and ’62—high praise by any standard!

selection by the Rt. Hon. Ernest Marples. Some of our

MACON: BLANG-LUGNY (22) .c2 92. 2.19 23.65

miles away. The ideal everyday wine. From the cellars of
the Rt. Hon. Ernest Marples.

The Rt. Hon. Ernest Marples sends us this excellent ex-
ample of the popular wine grown in this area.

tage. Dry, beautiful balance, intriguing bouquet. Estate-
bottled, Domaine Luquet.

bottled.

rationed.

1969 VINTAGE

There is an up-to-date vintage chart in the book “How To Eat
Better For Less Money” which describes the 1969 vintage in
white Burgundy as follows, “like the red Burgundies, the whites
have been produced in limited quantity, are extremely expen-
sive and are truly great. Be on the lookout for them. They are
long-lived.”
