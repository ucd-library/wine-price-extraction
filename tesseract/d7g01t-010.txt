  

A NOBLE HOLIDAY DUET

Your choice of

BENEDICTINE or ‘B and B’

The cry of ‘Eureka’ filled the air about the year

1510 at a Benedictine monastery in Fécamp,
11A France. It was during that period that Dom
“i Bernardo Vincelli discovered the secret of
making ‘Benedictine’ which was designed to
fortify and restore the spirits of the weary
monks. Shortly thereafter, this delicious
liqueur found favor with Francis | who discov-
ered it when he passed through the region in
1534.

During the 19th Century, the formula fell into
the hands of Monsieur Alexandre Le Grand
and his family have since been trusted to pre-
serve the formula. The ecclesiastical inscrip-
tion D.O.M., which means ‘Deo Optimo
Maximo’ still is carried on every bottle of both
‘Benedictine’ and ‘B and B’.

Note the delightful holiday wrapping. Historic-

ally and symbolically most suitable as a
Christmas gift.

LIQUEURS FROM GERMANY

forests of southern Germany—redolent of herbs and spice.
Barenjager is a rich, sweet, honey-based cordial with an
especially nice scent. Each makes an attractive gift.

LES CHARMES 1975 our choice

Jagermeister or Barenjager
t at 12.50 the bottle

     
   
    

A gold medal winning glory
from the Maconnais of
southern Burgundy. This
outstanding Pinot Chardon-
nay les Charmes won the
top award in its class at the
Paris Wine Fair for its clean
dryness, grace and distin-
guished bouquet. The price
is lower than one would ex-
pect for a wine of this qual-
ity—only 2.99 the bottle,
34.10 the case.
