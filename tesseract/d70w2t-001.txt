EACH WAS SELECTED BY THE JURY OF TASTERS OF
THE CONFRERIE DES CHEVALIERS DU TASTEVIN

Outstanding red Burgundies of the great years of 1961 and 1959 are hard to come by. Practically none exist
in the cellars of Burgundy. These four thoroughbreds have been nurtured to their present excellence and
maturity under the loving and knowledgeable care of Monsieur Trinquet, a distinguished wine authority
who has been head of the Vinicultural School of Beaune for some 30 years. His pupils include practically
all the top vintners who are making wine in Burgundy today.

As further testimony of the excellence, is the fact that Frank Schoonmaker tasted these wines, found them
outstanding, and he proved to be sufficiently persuasive to be able to acquire them. They are now resting
quietly in our cellars to bring their vinous joy to you. 7
