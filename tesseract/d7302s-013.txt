THE LOWER GARDENS—VERSAILLES Ile-de-France

 

Fine COGNACS

COL COURBE V.S.E.P. (Crooked Neck Bottle) 5.49 64.87

Col Courbe, in its interesting crooked neck bottle, is a fine example of the
delicacy and aromatic bouquet that can be achieved by a well made Cognac.

ADET IMPERIALE COGNAC . 5.99 68.50

We must start off by saying that the quality is superb and well above the Three
Star level. This brandy was originally imported to sell at $8.00 the bottle. The
Cognac firm of Adet is a very old house and has long enjoyed a reputation for
excellence, particularly in England where their brandies are in great demand.
Exceptional delicacy and distinction.

SINGLE CASK UNBLENDED COGNAC 9.98 114.00

Here is an Estate bottled Cognac that was produced during a great vintage year
(1929) in the most celebrated part of the Cognac country, “Grand Fine
Champagne”. It has remained in its unblended state in barrels from 1929 until
the present date. Cognac of this calibre is hard to come by because no more than
a few small growers have the patience and aptitude to put aside, year after year,
a distillation of their outstanding vintage.

HINE FAMILY RESERVE 24.75 285.00

Since the early 19th Century, it has been the custom of the Hine Family to set
aside the best Cognac produced during a particularly outstanding year for their
own future use—ultimately, this old precious reserve is served to honored guests
on special occasions. For the first time, Francios Hine, managing director of
this venerable firm, has consented to part with a few of these treasured bottles—
each is numbered and bears a back label relating the unique history of the
contents, hand-signed by a Hine director. 14
