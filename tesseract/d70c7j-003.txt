211 BEAUJOLAIS MONTMELAS 1955 .

The engaging and increasingly popular light red wines of Burgundy are at their best
when young and are excellent for summer dining. Here is a particularly pleasant
example at delightfully low sale cost.

BeACIOLAIS. RINGUET, 1955. ... =.

A distinguished Beaujolais that is everything that fine Beaujolais should be—purplish
red, with the fine aroma and taste of crushed grapes. A true discovery.

BEAUJOLAIS BROUILLY 1955 .

Domaine de L’Institute Pasteur

From a vineyard owned by one of the most famous medical foundations in the
world—Pasteur himself was, of course, a wine drinker and an ardent champion of
wine. This 1955 is particularly successful, soft, fine and full bodied. It is a wine
of which even Pasteur himself could have been proud.

CHATEAU DE MONTHELIE 1953 .

Estate Bottled, R. de Surmain

A discovery from the little village of Monthelie—soft, fruity, well balanced—a wine
which would sell for almost twice as much if it were only labelled (as it usually was
50 years ago) Pommard or Volnay.

JULIENAS 1955, Veuve du Boeuf . coe]
The northernmost town in Beaujolais is Julienas and its wines are the prize of
gastronomic Lyon. A real beauty.

CHASSAGNE MONTRACHET ROUGE 1953
Estate Bottled, C. Ramonet

This surprising wine comes from a top flight vineyard more famous for its whites
than its reds. Here is a red wine of astonishing class—big, sturdy, and full of what
Robert Louis Stevenson called “soft fire.”

NUITS ST. GEORGES, CLOS DES PORRETS, 1953
Estate Bottled, H. Gouges

The 17 acre vineyard of Porrets produces what is considered one of the most
remarkable examples of deep, full bodied, Nuits St. Georges. In the hands of Henri
Gouges, it certainly proved a classic in 1953.

BEAUNE GREVES 1953
Estate Bottled, Duvault-Blochet
Perhaps the finest red wine of the Cote de Beaune comes from the Greves vineyard
not far from Beaune, the wine capital. Here is a glorious 1953, round, well balanced,
of fine texture.

FIXIN, CLOS CHAPITRE, 1955
Estate Bottled, P. Gelin

A red wine of distinction and breed, and a flavor that recalls that of the famous
oo which are produced a few hundred yards farther south on the same
slope.

POMMARD LES EPENOTS 1953
Estate Bottled, Domaine Parent

2 e Ao @ > 1 1 7 : ‘ . 1’
Pommard was superb in 1953—this one is from the best vineyard in the township
a beautiful harmony of bouquet, finesse and body.

CORTON BRESSANDES 1955
Estate Bottled, M. Quenot

M. Quenot was for many years Mayor of Aloxe Corton. This typical 1955 is soft,
delicate, with admirable flavor and a brilliant future.
