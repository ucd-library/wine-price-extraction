THE WINES OF DOMAINE DE LA ROMANEE-CONTI

The Domaine de la Romanée-Conti represent¢ to the world of wine what Leonardo da Vinci,
Cezanne and Picasso represent to the world of Art. These rare jewels of Burgundian perfection
have just reached our cellars. They are not readily replaceable, because of world demand and
low production, and will not be with us too long. We suggest you acquire them now while they
are still available. The excellent 1963’s are a delight for present wine enjoyment and the 1966’s
represent a great investment for those who want to experience the best of Burgundy in the
years ahead.

It is no ordinary event to be able to offer the glorious wines of the Domaine in such years as
1964 and 1959. Here are wines that have now developed sufficient bottle age to represent the
best expression that Burgundy can offer the serious wine-drinker when the cork is drawn.
