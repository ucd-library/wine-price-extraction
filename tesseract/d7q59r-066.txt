We quote from James Beard, one of Amer- Bumpy

  
 

ica’s outstanding authorities on wine and
food, “The very existence, let alone the
sheer perfection of this 1805, is an historic
wine event—these 19th Century Madeiras

—— have provided one of the great wine tast-
> Maer ing experiences of my life.”

When these are gone, the opportunity to
a taste authentic 19th Century Vintage
Madeira of this calibre will be lost forever.
