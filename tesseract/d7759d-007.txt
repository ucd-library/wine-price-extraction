253 — BEAUJOLAIS RINGUET 1955

We quote from the New York Times, Jan.
29th, ‘then there is a Beaujolais that is all
a Beaujolais should be, but alas, seldom in
this country — purplish-red, with the fruity
aroma and taste of crushed grapes. In our
opinion, a true discovery for those who
want true Beaujolais at a modest price.
Half bottles at 84¢, case $18.95.
