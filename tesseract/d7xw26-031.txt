HERMITAGE BLANC 1970 .........----: 5.49 59.30
Estate-bottled, Domaine Jallade. Dry, full-bodied, pale
gold, pronounced bouquet.

HERMITAGE BLANC 1970 .........----- 5.50 59.50
Estate-bottled, Chante Alouette. Great character, among
the longest lasting of all dry white wines.

CONDRIED 1970. 323-2 os se te es 8.95 96.65
Condrieu is located about three miles south of Céte Rotie
on the Rhone. The wine is dry with a unique flowery
scent and an almost “spicy” aftertaste. A wine of great
breed and unusual character which is best in its youth.
One of our favorites. Estate-bottled, Vernay.
CHATEAU GRILLET 1969 ..........----- 16.50 178.20
The rarest wine in all of France. Only 185 cases pro-
duced annually. First importation into America—highly
rationed, dry, unique.

WMIOU HLANG 1970 =... ee. 2.49 26.90
Astonishing price for a dry white Loire of this estate-
bottled caliber. Lovingly grown and bottled by Saven-
nieres.

ANJOU BLANG MELLOW 1970.........-. 2.49 26.90
Rich, fruity, reflects the ‘Loire, garden of France.’
Savennieres.

MUSCADET-SUR-LIE 1971 .........---:: 2.59 27.95
‘Sur-Lie’ means that the wine never left the original
barrel and the contents were taken out from above leav-
ing the lees behind. This is a more costly and wasteful
process, but the result is that you get Muscadet with
more intense flavor. This beauty is estate-bottled by
Chateau Briacé and won First Award in a blind tasting
among Muscadets that was held recently in Paris.
OU Se an Se ee el aie wate oe 2.79 30.15
Not unlike a dry Sancerre or Pouilly Blanc-Fume. Total
acreage only about 400. Raymond Pipet.

SANGERRE 1970) 22250 ee ees a oe 3.69 39.85
Sancerre is famed for its small rounds of goat cheese;
it is equally known for the Sancerre it produces, since it
is considered the best wine commune of the Sancerre
area. Estate-bottled, Cherrier.

VOUVRAY 1969 9.2.03. 3s. 3.69 39.85
At this time of year, the familiar cry “Ouvrez le Vouv-
ray” resounds. Estate-bottled, Diard.
POUILLY-BLANC-FUME 1971 ........... 3.69 39.85
Georges Gaudry is the estate-bottler here. Don't let the
relatively low price dissuade you. In truth, this wine
makes a serious bid to being the best single dry white
wine produced in the charming wine town of Pouilly-
sur-Loire.

POUILLY-BLANG-FUME 1970 ........... 4.89 52.80
Ladoucette, the best single source of white wine in the
entire Loire, sends us this glorious dry white wine—the
very wine featured in outstanding restaurants of Paris,
London and New York. Particularly outstanding in the
1970 vintage.

SANGERKE 1970 ... 2... 5.10 55.08
Estate-bottled, Chateau de Sancerre. This is the most
famed and most sought-after vineyard of the district.

THE LOIRE VALLEY

The Loire meanders for over 600 miles through France and
wine is grown along its banks from the Atlantic Ocean almost
up to Lyon. Because of the vast area, Loire wines include a
wide and interesting diversity of both whites and reds ranging
from the acceptable to the outstanding. Here are the best.

Champigny was the favorite of Clemenceau and this red
wine still sells under the slogan ‘‘Le tigre en buvait
aussi.”

Higher up in the hills from Chinon. Excellent. Estate-

bottled, Couly.

ALSATIAN WINES

The choicest vineyards of Alsace are on the slopes of the

Vosges Mountains starting from Mulhouse continuing north to

Strasbourg. The Alsatian wines are usually named after the

grape from which they are made such as Sylvaner, Riesling,

Cewurztraminer, etc. Their distinguishing characteristics are

flowery fragrance, relatively dry, but fruity.

686 SYLVANER 1970 ..........-+:+++s39egmm 1.99 21.50
Very light, fruity, easy drinkability—ideal wine for lunch-
eon menus and for ‘spritzers.’ Note low price. Andre

spicy, fragrant and flowery bouquet of the Gewurz-

Superior example of the spicy grape from Trimbach.

668 GEWURZTRAMINER SPATLESE 1969.... 3.79 40.95
Just as in Germany, a late picking in Alsace, which gives
greater richness, bears the name ‘Spatlese.’ Rich, luxuri-
ous. Trimbach.

941 GEWURZTRAMINER GRAND CRU 1969.. 3.80 41.04
The ‘Grand Cru’ is to Alsace what a ‘First Growth’ is to
Bordeaux—one of the best of the area. F. Hugel.

490 CLOS ST. HUNE 1970 .........-+++sss0me 3.99 43.10
This is the very wine that was served by General De
Gaulle when he entertained President Nixon at the
Elysées Palace. Makes a bid to being considered the
best dry white wine of Alsace. Estate-bottled, Trimbach.

602 GEWURZTRAMINER

BEERENAUSLESE 1967 .........-+-++:> 12.85 138.80
