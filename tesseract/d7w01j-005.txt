Let us examine the facts.

The size of the great vineyards of Bordeaux are fixed by nature
and law, and yet they must contend with an ever-increasing world
demand, stimulated by world travel, added affluence, more leisure,
and increased popularization via books, magazines, radio and tele-
vision. Proof of this is that Chateau Lafite Rothschild 1959 has
dramatically moved from $48 the case in 1960 to almost $300 the
case today! We also know that 1968 was a relatively dismal vin-

67 CLARETS

tage in Bordeaux and the prices of the ’66s and ’67s that remain
on the Bordeaux market have gone up 10% to 20% during the
last few months.

An objective evaluation of the two vintage years, 1966 and 1967,
in red Bordeaux was recently provided in the new TIME-LIFE
book “Wines & Spirits’”—here, we quote directly from the book.

1966—The Chateau owners were happy as they gathered this
great vintage; they were able to obtain the highest prices for
claret in Bordeaux wine history. A bit less body than the ’64s,
but compensated for by unusual bouquet, better balance, and a
remarkable similarity to the extraordinary ’53s, as well as suffi-
cient tannin to provide the backbone for exceptional longevity.
Recommended for laying down in private wine cellars.

1967—The crop was most beneficial to the wine drinker because
it was exceptionally large, above average in quality, and pro-
duced a soft, quick-maturing, fruity wine with a fine bouquet.
This most useful, satisfying vintage can be consumed joyously
while we wait for the slower maturing ’61s and ’66s to come to

their full fruition. :
1966 1967

Favored vineyard owned by Marcel Dassault, famed creator of the
Mirage-Mystere, and Falcon Jet. Our tasting notes read, “astonishing—
big, fat, outstanding St. Emilion—obviously good for another decade.”

Suet ene ta, (Melo) i). a

A ‘sleeper.’ From an excellent Medoc vineyard owned by Georges Hereil,
President of Simca.

CHATEAU LATOUR CARNET (Medoc)......... eg
Ranked in the 1855 classification on the same level as Beychevelle, Talbot
and Duhart-Milon. Since its small size did not permit world-publicity,
it is therefore a ‘best buy.’

CHATEAU L’ANGELUS (St. Emilion).................. —
Restaurants of Paris and New York have used up the 1964.

Now is the time to get the excellent ’66s ready to drink Fall ’69.
CHATEAU PRIEURE-LICHINE (Margaux)

Good color; lovely nose. Fine fruit and finish.

CHATEAU CALON SEGUR (St. Estephe)......_. eee a emt
Enormous body combined with softness and longevity. ’67 graceful. :
CHATEAU BOUSCAUT (Graves) er i a oe

We quote Cyril Ray in the London Observer, “Chateau Bouscaut is A
fine, full-bodied, yet far from heavy wine... typical of red Graves in
developing more quickly than a comparable Medoc yet lasting as long.”
