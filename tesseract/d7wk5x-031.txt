its best, and an astonishingly fine
Chateauneuf du Pape.

RED WINES

243 BEAUJOLAIS FLEURIE 1955
Beaujolais is best drunk young, when the freshness and
fruity qualities are most apparent. The best comes from
the township of Fleurie. This superb example is estate
bottled by the local cooperative. Extraordinary.

236 CLOS PEGLISE 1953
This is the remarkable Pomerol that was recently singled
out by the New York Times. We quote “‘in the group is
a heavier red wine, a 1953 chateau bottled Claret from
the district of Pomerol. It boasts a body and bouquet that
completely belie its small price.”

957 CHATEAU VIEUX CERTAN 1953

The soft, full wines of Pomerol are now developing world
recognition and are no longer easy to acquire.

2951 CHATEAU LEOVILLE LASCASES
1953

Very fine. A perfect example of St. Julien.

CHATEAUNEUF DU PAPE 1952
Estate Bottled, Clos des Felibres

Towering high above the town of Chateauneuf, in. the
rockiest of soil, is the remarkable Clos des Felibres vine-
yard. We spent three days in the town comparing the
wines, and we are now quite convinced that this is the best
example produced in the area. An extraordinary blend of
lustiness and elegance.

BEAUJOLAIS BROUILLY 1955

Estate Bottled, Domaine des Tours

Beaujolais at its absolute best — Estate bottled at the best
vineyard in the town of Brouilly — won a Grand Award
at the Paris Fair as an outstanding example of Beaujolais
produced during 1955.

HERMITAGE, LES MOINES, 1954
Estate Bottled, Chierpe

1954 fared well in the Rhone Valley. “Les Moines’ is
considered the best small vineyard of Hermitage. An amaz-
ing sale opportunity for those who want truly outstanding

CHATEAU SEGUR 1949 (Medoc)
