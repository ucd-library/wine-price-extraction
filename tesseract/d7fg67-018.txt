Wine lovers everywhere are eagerly aw arrival of the
better 1961 Beaujolais and Pouilly Fuisse. S wine event
is now taking place—two superb red wines ‘lais, Moulin-A-
Vent and Fleurie are sn—and there is also a classi illy Fuisse
__and one of the best pink wines we have ever tasted—the Beaujolais
Rose 1961.

Each of these wines was selected by Alexis Lichine, who states, “Some
of the best Beaujolais I have ever tasted in my lifetime was produced
during 1961—the wines are typical, firmer than the 1959, longer-lived,
with a classic vigor that will delight the wine lover.”

The production during this great vintage year was small, the better
wines are hard to come by, and the prices at the vineyard are record-
breaking. Nevertheless, by quantity purchasing, we have managed to
keep the prices down at a modest level. You will find all four of these
sae delightful for day-in, day-out drinking during the summer days
ahead.
