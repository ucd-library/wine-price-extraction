The 1961 red Burgundies are truly great, firm, well
balanced and long-lived. The crop was a small one, the
demand was great, and the price at the vineyard was
inevitably expensive. The white Burgundies are fairly
full-bodied, but have the racy breed of the 1952s. Our
suggestion is to acquire them now, while still available,
and at these relatively low prices.
