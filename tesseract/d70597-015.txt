Perhaps the best and most complete

seen, was recently prepared by

world’s great authorities. Should you
want a copy, simply phone or write
us and we will dispatch it promptly
(no charge) ...our clientele asks,
“Should we buy wine now or wait
until the Fall?”—the answer is de-
cidedly “Now’”—because our crystal
ball indicates clearly that importers
will charge us substantially more
than they are presently charging us
by Autumn, and the increase must
inevitably be passed on—therefore,
our advice is to buy during the Sum-
mer those wines you intend consum-
ing next Winter... have you ever
tried the interesting wines from
Czecho-Slovakia, Rumania, Aus-
tralia, England or Bulgaria? They
represent fun and satisfy curiosity
you will find them listed in these

 

pages and you might consider ac-
quiring a few for an intriguing wine
tasting, with your friends, in your
home... the 12 bottle assortment of
the wines of the Beaujolais area,
selected by The Rt. Hon. Ernest
Marples, is taking New York by

 

storm. For $32.95 complete, it is de-
livered in a handsome, lacquered
wooden wine rack that remains as a
useful storage object long after its
joyous contents are consumed...nor
should you ignore the Bordeaux-
3urgundy Assortment that is also
available in the lacquered wine rack.
If you buy six of them, you have an
Erector-Set basis for constructing
your own wine cellar, without cost
to you, capable of holding 72 bottles

_.. in the process of offering wines,
we are constantly on the lookout for
the best in spirits. If you appreciate
old bourbon at modest cost, do not
overlook the Dowling de Luxe 14
Year Old Kentucky Bourbon avail-
able to you at the astonishingly low
price of below $5.99 the bottle...
nor should the whiskey appreciater
ignore the Anderson Club 8 Year
Old Kentucky Rye at below $4.99 the
bottle... have you ever tasted the
rare old red Burgundies from the
legendary cellar of Dr. Alfred
Barolet?... St. Edmund Hall is the
oldest and one of the most tradi-

Wines and spirits that proudly bear
the label of this 13th Century col-
lege, are now available to you (see
inside back cover)... Chateau Lafite
Rothschild 1971 has just opened in
Bordeaux at the highest price that
any unbottled wine has ever com-
manded in recorded history... the
excellent Cotes du Rhone Rouge
1970, if you buy 5 cases at one time,
costs only $90 (averaging out at
$1.50 the bottle)—this has solved
the daily red wine drinking problem
of hundreds of our wine loving
friends ... the Brouilly 1971, estate-
bottled at Chateau de La Chaize, has
outsold any other wine in our his-
tory. Perhaps it is because it won

the Gold Award at the recent Macon
Fair; or it might be that everyone
loves it and comes back for more—
whatever the reason, we happily re-
port, despite temporary depletion,
that a new shipment has just
reached us ... at $23.65 the case, the
dry, excellent Macon Blane Lugny
1970 of The Rt. Hon. Ernest Marples
is proving to be the most popular of
our white Burgundies ... for those
who are courageous, and want to
drink outstandingly fine white Bur-
gundy of a relatively unfashionable
year, we suggest the Puligny Mon-
trachet 1968 at $3.99... for the same
reasons, do not ignore the excellent,
relatively low priced 1963 red Bur-
gundies...one of Ernest Heming-
way’s favorite red wines was the
Spanish Rioja, Banda Azul ($17.93

     
 
     
      

the case) ...if a Double-Magnum
of Mouton Rothschild 1929 could
command over $9,000 at Christie’s
auction, should you not put away
for the future a Double-Magnum of
a Lafite Rothschild of great vintage
year? (See Page 25)... the favorite
wine of our sales staff is the full
litres (33% oz.) of Verona red and
white at $1.79 each, described on
Page 24... we happily report that
the new book of our associate, James
3eard, “James Beard’s American
Cookery” is the current Book-of-the-
Month Club selection. The reviews
testify that it will live as a greaf
gastronomic classic...if you are
planning a trip to Europe, and would
like to visit the vineyards, do not
fail to make an indispensable part
of your luggage the newly issued
book ‘A Wine Tour of France’ writ-
ten by our good friend, Frederick
S Wildman, Jr...

ADDED NOTES :—Turn the page,
and you will discover the ‘Carefree
Wines From Everywhere’ — a few
will help solve the problem of good,
honest wine at low cost...at the
last moment, we became aware that
we neglected to include the robust,
excellent red wine of Morocco—Ait
Mogia — a wine that can stand up
against a lusty Burgundy, at $2.79
the bottle, $31.50 the case... re-
peated requests reach us for copies
of Sam Aaron’s talk on ‘Wine &
Culture,’ which was presented at
Oxford University. Should you want
a copy, please phone or write and it
will be mailed immediately ... the
‘Regional Samplers in Wine Rack,’
which were selected for us by James
Beard and The Rt. Hon. Ernest
Marples, are selling out. Since our
supply is limited, it is suggested that
you order these promptly, to avoid
any frustration that might be
caused should they be gone before
your order reaches us...James
Beard is enthusiastic about ‘Lillet
Cassis’ and you will be delighted
with it too. Here is the recipe—put
one or two ice cubes in a generous
tulip-shaped wine glass add 3 oz.
of Lillet and 14 oz. of Cassis. Presto!
The color will please the eye—and
the delicious taste will please the
palate...since we are discussing
James Beard, we secretly report that
he blends his own Scotch affixes his
own hand-written label (it reads—
James Beard’s Personal Scotch
Blend)—here’s his formula and the
average cost per bottle is about $5.00
—it is probably the best Scotch you
or I have ever tasted. Simply mix
one bottle of Glenfiddich 10 Year Old
Unblended with five bottles of Clan
MacGregor. Afterwards, pour back
into six empty bottles and glue on
your own hand-written label. It will
match in depth of flavor and balance,
any $9.00 bottle of Scotch in the land
__. Here’s a suggestion fora low cost,
bone-dry, before-dinner aperitif —
pour 3 oz. of the pale Rivero Fino
Salma Sherry over the rocks (only
$2.19 the bottle)...

 

 

Happy tastin g!
