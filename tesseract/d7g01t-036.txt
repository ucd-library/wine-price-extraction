THREE EXALTED CHAMPAGNES
FROM PERRIER-JOUET

     
 

Perrier-Jouet, a small highly-regarded firm founded
1811, has specialized in first-rate Champagnes since
the Napoleonic Wars. Most of their remarkable wine
grows on 250 precious acres owned by the concern in
the heart of the Champagne district. Three of the fruits
of this vineyard we are proud to present here. All are at
wonderfully low price levels.

ne world 8 YEAR OLD SCOTCH

      
 

8,4

 
 

This Scotch deserves recogni-
tion—it is not to be taken for
‘granted.’ It is a proud product
of an individual family distillery
—every drop is 8 or more years
old—a consistent favorite in the
British Isles—and a happy har-
mony of all of the elements that
are necessary to move a Scotch
upward from standard accep-
tance into a more exalted, more
mellow, more appreciated area.
Recommended for gift-giving. ,

CHATEAU DE LA CHAIZE
IN ITS TRICENTENARY MAGNUM

It's not often that the vineyard which grows one of our
most popular wines celebrates a 300th anniversary. Well,
1976 was such a year for Chateau de La Chaize in Beaujo-
lais. To mark the event, the Marquis and Marquise de
Roussy de Sales, the proprietors, have bottled their great
1975 Brouilly in a dramatic magnum bottle, with the now
famous label embossed in gold right on the glass.

     
   
  
   
 

    
    
 
 

    
    
  
   
 

The result is a wonderful gift-impressive in more ways
than one. The wine is always good—rich, fruity, with a
lovely bouquet. And in the big magnum bottle, the effect
is wonderful, indeed. The cost of the magnum is 9.95, or
29.85 for a gift box of three.
