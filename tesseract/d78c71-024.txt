We launch 1969 with a wine event of significance — a proud offering of
the most remarkable collection of authentic Chateau-bottled Clarets, some
of pre-war vintage, that can be found either in France or America. This
event has only been made possible by the generosity of our good friend,

Alain Miailhe, proud proprietor of Pichon Lalande. These wines orginated

 

from the personal reserve of the Miailhe family — an offering only made
possible because of the practice of the proprietors to hold back a reserve

of every vintage year.

We quote from Alexis Lichine’s Encyclopedia of Wines, “Pichon Lalande
is entirely enclosed within a semi-circle formed by the Chateau Latour
vineyard behind it. The character of the wine from some parts of the
estate is very close to that of Chateau Latour. Lighter and more supple
than Pichon-Longueville-Baron, this excellent wine seems, in the 1960s,
to be gaining an edge of popularity over Pichon-Baron.

The 1928 and 1926 vintages will astonish you by their youth, vigor, and
completeness. The 1955 is great, ready, and is being offered at an amaz-
ingly low price — the 1964 is considered by many experts as a peer of
the first growths in the Pauillac — and now is the time — before the price
soars — to obtain your 1966 and 1967. For the more curious among you,
we urge that you acquire the mixed case of 12 bottles described here.
