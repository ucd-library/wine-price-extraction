Our fathers often tell us of the excellence and
virtues of the Pre-Prohibition Bourbons of their
youth. We recently conducted a blind tasting,
matching the “16 Year Old Collector’s Item”
against two whiskies that were distilled in 1917
and bottled in 1933. To everyone’s surprise, the
‘Collector’s Item’ was chosen as the better. Only
last month, ‘Collector’s Item’ was sold below
$11.99 the bottle and it was well worth it. If you
have friends or relatives that truly appreciate
rare old bourbon, now is the time to acquire your
supply for your Christmas needs — because the
probability is that our limited inventory will be

exhausted before the end of the year.
