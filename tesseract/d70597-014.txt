A Jeroboam of Chateau Mouton-
Rothschild 1929 was bid in last
month at the spectacular price of
$9,200 the bottle! This historic event
won world-wide notice on television,
radio, periodicals and newspapers.
The staggering sum generated much
soul-searching on the part of econo-
mists and wine lovers and the ques-
tion was asked, “Whither is wine
drifting?” A proper balance and in-
telligent long-range projection was
best capsulized in an article that
appeared in NEWSWEEK on June
5th. We quote from the ‘Life and
Leisure’ column of this important
weekly below:

“But it is not just the rare, classic
wines that are soaring in price. As
most wine lovers know all too well,
the more modest vintages are also
becoming considerably more expen-
sive, particularly the French wines
...The Burgundies are also climbing
and even a modest Beaujolais rose
from $2.49 to $3.19 in the past year.
And inflation is not limited to
French wines; California vintages
are also going up...Wine prices are
responding to the law of supply and
demand. Some harvests in France
and California have been relatively
small recently, and at the same time
wine has become increasingly fash-
ionable. “It used to be Cadillacs, then
it was hi-fi and then it was knowing
about art,” says Sam Aaron, Presi-
dent of Sherry-Lehmann, a New
York wine and spirits retailer. “Now
knowing about wine is the ‘in’
thing.” To make matters worse, the
devaluation of the dollar has added
about 10 per cent to the price of
most imported wines sold in the
eis.

For their part, many American wine
merchants contend that their profit
margins are small and that in-
creased wholesale prices hurt them
as much as the consumer. The an-
swer to rising prices, many people
in the industry believe, is greater
selectivity on the part of modest-
budget wine drinkers. ‘““We’re en-
couraging customers to try the less
expensive wines,’ says Aaron.
“You’ve got to get out of Bordeaux
and Burgundy,’’ he adds. Wine
writer Alexis Bespaloff observes:
“Only a few names are well-known
and everyone falls on them for
reassurance. People who buy wines

from famous areas are paying for
quality but they’re also paying for
scarcity and glamor.”

Among the lesser-known French
wines, experts recommend those
from the Loire, the Rhone and AI-
sace, among others... It is also ad-
visable to try wines from countries
other than France. Low-priced Por-
tuguese wines and Rioja reds and
whites from Spain are considered
good values, as are the Yugoslavian
and Chilean versions of Cabernet
Sauvignon... Domestic vintages
should also be investigated by Amer-
ican wine lovers. American wines
have been coming into their own in
recent years, and some vineyards
produce wines worthy of compari-
son, with the best French imports.
Some of the best domestic wines are
quite costly, but the inexpensive
ones are sometimes surprisingly
satisfying...”

We now move from the world of
wine into the world of art. We have
long been unstinted admirers of the
great artistic creativity of Pablo
Picasso. Thanks to our good friend,
Harry N. Abrams, the eminent pub-
lisher of books on art, it has been
possible for us to embellish our wine
list with reproductions of the
graphic work of Picasso. We hope
that his generosity will achieve a
similar sense of appreciation among
the readers of this catalog. We share
the opinion of Mr. Clifton Fadiman,
who, in the introduction to this bro-
chure, sees a thread of connection,
however slight, between art and
wine We particularly commend to
those of our readers who appreciate
gloriously executed volumes on art,
the three books published by Harry
N. Abrams, Inc. from which the re-
productions that you see within
these pages were extracted. The
books are ‘Picasso Linoleum Cuts,’
‘Picasso, Recent Etchings & Litho-
graphs,’ and ‘Picasso—Text by Hans
L. C. Jaffe.’ All are available at lead-
ing book stores.

Living during an anxious period of
cost-consciousness, devaluation, in-
flation, the consumer has a legiti-
mate reason for asking, “Does it cost
more to buy wine at Sherry-
Lehmann?” Our comparative shop-
pers indicate that, in balance, over a
period of time, the probability is

that there is more value, dollar-for-
dollar, at Sherry-Lehmann than in
any other shop in the country. If in-
trinsic excellence after the cork is
drawn, reliability, and careful selec-
tion are valid criteria, we believe
that our comparative shoppers are
reporting accurately.

Wall Street claims that ‘wine’ is one
of the great growth industries of
America; wine societies are flourish-
ing; and articles about the subject
appear almost daily in the press. We
are all aware of the educational ex-
cellence of such tasting groups as
Confrerie des Chevaliers du Taste-
vin, Commanderie de Bordeaux, The
Wine & Food Society and Automa-
tion House Wine Society. We have
watched publications such as ‘Wine,’
‘Revue du Vin de France,’ ‘Vintage’
and ‘Wine World’ flourish. New on
the scene is the popular, well-
subscribed Four Seasons Wine Sym-
posium, which conducts a school at
the Four Seasons Restaurant, just
off Park Avenue (our associates,
David Reilly, Michael and Sam
Aaron spell each other as Sympo-
sium lecturers). Only recently,
Women’s Wear Daily devoted two
pages to the wine drinking habits of
prominent Americans. None of these
events would have been remotely
possible only a decade ago. Few of
us are aware that the Ivy League
Cornell University, conducts a 2-
point course in its Liberal Art Pro-
gram called ‘Wine Appreciation.’

The course is under the supervision
of Vance Christian of the Cornell
Hotel School, and Sam Aaron is in-
vited to lecture there periodically—
further evidence that wine enjoy-
ment and understanding has truly
come of age and the future is
brilliant.
