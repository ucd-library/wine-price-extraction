based on
early

acquisition

“Sandwiched beween two great years, this vin-
tage is somewhat unfashionable. In fact, the
60s are better than average wines. Early heat
caused an excellent flowering and the promise
of a big crop. This promise was fulfilled — but
later rains washed away some of the hopes.
The °60s lacked the tannin and acidity that
would give them a long life. They are very at-
tractive for current consumption— soft wines
with a pronounced bouquet. A worthy succes-
sor to the ’58s.
