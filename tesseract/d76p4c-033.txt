CASK OF AMONTILLADO

We are very fond of a lovely custom observed in many
private homes in the south of Spain. There, when the host
offers you a glass of Amontillado, he has tapped it directly
from the wooden cask. The ceremony is impressive and
the wine is fresh and delicious.

The Montilla district of Spain now sends us a limited quan-
tity of their ‘home-size’ casks of Amontillado. The wine is
dry with a beautiful, nutty finish. The wooden barrels—con-
taining 8 liters (270.4 oz.) or the equivalent of approximately
11 bottles—are made by hand and are presented on a hand-
some wooden stand. As you drink the wine and the level in
the barrel decreases, you can simply add more Amontillado
from a regular bottle. In that way, the cask will last in-

Only $89.50 complete
