= nan e, anc a best (produced by small vineyard owners, generally for their own use) is hard to come by. We were
able to persuade Monsieur Clerget to part with ten cases of this, out of his personal reserve, and there is no possibility
of our being able to secure more.

1294 ARMAGNAC (Domaine d’?Ognoas) . . . . . Made 1941 8.40 96.00

A truly remarkable unblended Armagnac, distilled back in 1941, it is indeed a discovery for those who want Brandy of
unique pedigree at modest cost. 100 proof, it is austere, bone dry and possessing an unusually pale color of its own, the
simple result of oak and time. Its natural proof of 100, achieved after 16 years of aging in the barrel is unreduced and
unchanged. This Armagnac offers the exhilarating experience of clean, fine, lasting bouquet, powerful flavour and unmis-
takable class associated with only the finest brandies.

1297 SINGLE CASK UNBLENDED COGNAC ... . 9.98 9.45 108.00
Here is an Estate-bottled Cognac that was produced during a great vintage year (1929) in the most celebrated part of
the Cognac country. “Grand Fine Champagne.” It has remained in its unblended state in barrels from 1929 until the
present date. Cognac of this calibre is hard to come by because no more than a few small growers have the patience and
aptitude to put aside, year after year, a distillation of their outstanding vintages.
