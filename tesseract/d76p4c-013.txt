AMBASSADOR 12 and 25 YEAR OLD

The knowledgeable Cognac drinkers of France consider this the

best example of brandy produced in their country, regardless of

price, age, or package elegance. We now concur with that-opinion,

after much comparative tasting.

Here is an estate-bottled Cognac that was produced during a great

vintage year in the most celebrated part of the Cognac country,
“Grande Fine Cham-
pagne.’’ It has re-
mained in its un-
blended state in barrel
from its birth until the
present date.

It comes to Sherry-
Lehmann directly from
the farm of a vineyard
owner in the heart of
Cognac country — the
grapes were grown on
Monsieur Ragnaud’s
own hillside acres in
a great vintage year;
they were pressed and
became wine in his
own cellars; the wine
was distilled into Cog-
nac in his own pot-still
and put to age in the
finest oak casks. ob-
tainable. Impeccable,
authoritative, rich and
fine.
