these 19th Century Madeiras, is an historic wine event
that have provided one of the great wine tasting experi-
ences of my life,” states James Beard.

We launch the holiday season with this epoch-making
offering of the most remarkable collections of authentic

seen either in Continental Europe or the United States.

old Madeiras of this caliber will be lost forever.
