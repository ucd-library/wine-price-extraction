 

  

Look for recognized districts such
as Medoc and St. Emilion. More
specific, and hence generally better
are chateau-bottled clarets bearing
such names as Chateau Beychevelle,
Cos d’Estournel, Gruaud Larose.
Lascombes, Leoville Lascases, Lynch
Bages, Palmer and Pichon Longue-

ville.

White Bordeaux of 1955, °57
and °59—2 bottles. Choose Sauter-
nes or Barsac as sweet dessert wines
and Graves as a moderately dry
wine. Among the chateau bottlings
to look for are Chateau Haut Brion
Blanc, Latour Blanche, Climens and
Yquem.

Beaujolais 1959 and ’61—2 bot-
tles. Here are the good red coun-
try wines of France—the younger
the better.

Red Burgundies, 1955, °57 and
°59—4 bottles. Ask your wine mer-
chant to give you estate-bottlings.
Look for such great vineyards as
Bonnes Mares, Chambertin, Clos
Vougeot, Corton, Echezeaux, Pom-
mard Epenots, Richebourg, Musig-

ny; anda Tacue.

White Burgundies 1959 and ’60
(and soon the great ’61)—2 bot-
tles. The dry white wine glories of
Irance. Select among the great
areas such as Montrachet, Chass-
agne or Puligny Montrachet, Corton
Charlemagne, Meursault and Chab-
lis (the lightest and driest) and
Pouilly Fuissé (the least expensive
and most popular). Here, too, ask
for estate bottlings.

Country Wines of Europe of
1959, ’60 and ’61—4 bottles. These
wines are fun, delightful, not ex-
pensive and provide an adventure
in tasting. Choose among Muscadet,

Sancerre, Vouvray and  Pouilly
Fumé from the Loire; Riesling or
Gewurtztraminer from Alsace;

Chateauneuf-du-Pape or Hermitage
Rouge from the Rhone; Rioja red
or white from Spain; the red Chi-

anti and Valpolicella and white

Soave from Italy; the Gumpold-
skirchner from Austria; Neuchatel
from Switzerland; Vinho Verde and
Dao from Portugal—all easily avail-

able and all inexpensive.

Vin Rosé—2 bottles. The versa-
tile pink wine that adjusts to al-
most any menu. Those from Cali-
fornia are excellent, or choose a
modestly-priced French rosé from
Tavel, Rhone, Provence, Bordeaux,
or Anjou.

California Red Wine—2 bottles.
Don’t overlook the beautiful red
wines that are produced in north-
ern California. The best bear the
grape names Cabernet and Pinot

Noir.

American White Wine—2 _ bot-
tles. Excellent examples of dry
white wine are grown in Northern
California and New York State.
The best bears the grape name
Pinot Chardonnay, followed by
Riesling, Semillon, Traminer and
Sauvignon Blanc.

Rhine and Moselle 1959, °60
and °61—3 bottles. Some of the
greatest white wines of the world
are produced here. Pick °59 for
richness and ’60 or ’61 for relative
dryness. Avoid the meaningless but
popular name of Liebfraumilch.
You will be rewarded by asking for
the hard-to-pronounce but wonder-
ful wines that bear the name of a
town followed by a vineyard sufhx,
such as Niersteiner Orbel, Ravent-
hazer Baiken, Zeltinger Himmel-

reich, etc.

Champagnes—2 bottles. Good to
have on hand in any wine library
for anniversaries, birthdays, etc.,
as the most glamorous of festive
drinks. Acquire the excellent French
non-vintage Brut rather than vin-
tage to conserve budget, or one of
the good American champagnes.
