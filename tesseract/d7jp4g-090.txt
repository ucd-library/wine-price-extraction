329 BOURGOGNE ROUGE, Nicolas ..... 1.99 21.50
What this country needs is not ‘‘a good five-cent cigar’, but a good
bottle of Burgundy at $2.00. Here it is. You can drink it day-in and
day-out, not worry too much about the expense, and you would be drink-
ing typical wine of the Cote d’Or.

668 PINOT NOIR DE MARSANNAY,

rea |. 2.49 26.90

Made of the noble Pinot Noir grape that has flourished in some of the
best soil of Burgundy, not too far south from Dijon.

571 COTE DE BEAUNE VILLAGES,
Wn ee 2.49 26.90

The appellation ‘“‘Cote de Beaune Villages’ means that it is wine of the
Cote de Beaune from a township other than Beaune itself. Here is an
excellent Burgundy of the middle group that gives you good wine at
modest cost.

250 SANTENAY, Clair Dau ............ 3.49 37.70

Southernmost village of the Cote d’Or. Quite soft with a “goutte de
terroir’ or a pleasant, earthy taste. Excellent future here.

244 MONTHELIE, Potinet-Ampeau ..... 3.49 37.70

Tiny village back of Volnay; among the best of the lesser-known Bur-
gundies.

338 ALOXE CORTON,
Ghandon de Brailles ............... 3.69 39.85

Excellent breed and finesse. From an impeccable producer. Exceptional
class.

509 FIXIN CLOS NAPOLEON, Gelin .... 3.79 40.95

Northernmost village of the Cote de Nuits. Comparable in quality to the
better Gevrey Chambertins.

224 BEAUNE CENT VIGNES, Duchet .... 3.79 40.95

The better vintages of Beaune are characterized by softness and are
notable for finesse and aroma. They are relatively quick to mature. Here
is a true glory produced in the happy vintage year of 1964.

308 MOREY ST. DENIS, CLOS BUSSIERE,

Meee a 3.99 43.10
Firm, sturdy and long-lived. It has the kind of depth of flavor associated
with Chambertin itself, but at about half the price.

315 VOSNE ROMANEE, J. Grivot ....... 3.99 43.10

Jean Grivot is one of the most attractive and most intelligent of the
younger generation of vignerons. Though the wine only bears the name
of the village and not a great vineyard name, this delicate, well-balanced
1964 is really a wine of remarkable class.

285 GEVREY CHAMBERTIN, Tortochot . 3.99 43.10
We have had literally dozens of people asking us for Tortochot’s Cham-
bertin because they claim it is the best Red Burgundy they have ever
tasted. Here, Tortochot did not plough the famed Chambertin vineyard,

but a vineyard only a 3-minute walk away. It has much of the class at
a fraction of the price.

259 CHAMBOLLE MUSIGNY, Cambola.. 3.99 43.10

Celebrated wine-producing township. Here is a superb example, nour-
ished with loving care by the Mayor of the town, Alain Roumier.

The Great 1964

A crisis has been reached in Burgundy. There was joy after the 1966
vintage of red wines were gathered. But then there followed in rapid
succession two disastrous years—1967 and 1968. The result, as we go to
press, is that we, as wine merchants, must pay as much as 25% more
for any treasured Burgundies of the 1966 and 1964 vintages that may
remain in the cellars of the reputable growers. The prices listed here

will surely soar next year.

The 1964 red Burgundies, among the best and most enjoyable of our
time, have been maturing in our cellars for the last three years. Suffi-
cient bottle age has now been acquired, so that they can be served
proudly at your holiday dinner table with the assurance that even the
most modestly qualified wine-lover among your guests will quickly rec-
ognize its virtues, fruit, depth and harmonious balance.

Drink any of them today joyously—or lay them away for the future.
Whichever you do, you will be making no mistake if good red Burgundy
is your preference.

276 POMMARD, de Courcel............ 4.49 48.50

Much of the wine that bears the easy-to-remember name of Pommard
must be delicious, since ten times as much is sold around the world
than is produced. We are dealing here with a genuine, estate-bottled
example of great class and the well-balanced qualities associated with
superb Pommard.

440 CHAMBOLLE MUSIGNY,
LES CHARMES, Cambola .......... 4.49 48.50

From one of the best vineyards of the famed township—Les Charmes.
A true thorough-bred. Alain Roumier, the grower, is deservedly proud
lealite

759 POMMARD RUGIENS, Lejeune ..... 4.79 51.75

There are two great vineyards in Pommard and ‘‘Rugiens”’ is one of
them. It is soft and beautifully balanced, superb fruit, and a fantastic
amount of finesse.

5010 NUITS ST. GEORGES, PRULIERS,
Ol ees ee 4.79 51.75

Excellent wines are produced in this township, especially at a top flight
vineyard such as ‘‘Pruliers’’. Look for the softness and balance and the
earthy flavor that has earned it its world fame.

403 CHAPELLE CHAMBERTIN,

Prerte Wamey ©. .66 B79. $62.55
Like its neighbor Chambertin itself, the 13-acre vineyard of Chapelle is
rated as Great Growth (Grand Cru). It exhibits the robustful flavor and
masculine qualities of Gevrey-Chambertin—qualities made even more
complex and admirable by exceptional fruit and finesse. In our opinion,
this wine will stand up and often surpass many famed red Burgundies
that command double the price.

5033 BEAUNE CLOS DES MOUCHES,
Pees ee 5.89 63.60

A classic that is much beloved by Burgundy drinkers and featured at
the better restaurants of New York and Paris.

394 CLOS VOUGEOT, Pierre Poupon .... 5.99 64.70

The largest vineyard in Burgundy! 124 acres and 65 owners! The pictur-
esque chateau and ancient wine press are located amidst the vines. They
are now the property of the famed Burgundian wine fraternity, the
Chevaliers du Tastevin.

372 CHAMBERTIN, Pierre Poupon ...... G.79 © 74.75

Chambertin is always extremely expensive and when good, deserves the
price. Extreme power, great longevity, extraordinary class. It was the
favorite of Napoleon and Alexandre Dumas who liked contemplating
life through a ‘‘glass of Chambertin”.

798 VOSNE ROMANEE,
LA GRANDE RUE, H. Lamarche..... 12.50 135.00

We quote from Frank Schoonmaker’s Encyclopedia of Wines, ‘‘La
Grande Rue is altogether astonishing; produced by old vines and in
extremely small quantity. It is unsurpassed, perhaps even unequalled,
by Romanee Conti, Richebourg and La Tache. It would be impossible
to give higher praise.”

1079 MUSIGNY, Comte de Vogue ....... 16.50 178.00

Among the most expensive vineyard land in the world. There are only
16 acres and some of it has been sold for over $30,000.00 the acre. Re-
markable delicacy and elegance coupled with extraordinary bouquet.
Matures beautifully and for many years. Many consider the Musigny of
Comte de Vogue the best single red wine produced in all Burgundy.
Quantity very limited. A few magnums are also available at $33.00 each.
