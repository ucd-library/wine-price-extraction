We stress the word “EXCITING”
our gift assortments. We are all familiar with the
well advertised brands and all of them are freely
available to you at our shop. You need merely
browse through these pages and pick your favorite.
(There is no additional charge for packaging when
sent in our standard gift wrapping.)

As we point out in the introduction, “Thoughtful
and imaginative gifts need not necessarily be over-
expensive.” Below, we have attempted to supple-
ment the highly popular and well-known brands
with a more imaginative approach, which focuses
on a theme.

Your gift selection can become even more dramatic
when sent in a unique container—all of which we
have priced at our cost. You can choose among
wicker hampers, ‘le Can-Can, the ‘Thermo-Keg,’
and the ‘James Beard Wine Rack.’ The cost of
these containers range from $2.00 up to a maxi-
mum of $4.95. We also pleasantly report that there
is no delivery charge for any gift order over $25.00
within the vast U.P.S. zone (below $25.00 kindly
add $1.50 delivery charge).
