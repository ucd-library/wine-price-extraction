HUGEL GEWURZTRAMINER 1973

For more than three
centuries, the renowned
firm of Hugel has been
growing delightful wines

in Alsace. Always one of

our favorites is their
Gewirztraminer—light,
sprightly, fragrant, and with
the ‘spicy’ quality that gives
the wine its name. What
better accompaniment to a
New Year’s choucroute

a l’alsacienne! (50.65 case)

4.69 bottle

GRANT’S
8 YEAR OLD SCOTCH

This Scotch deserves recogni-
tion—it is not to be taken for
‘granted.’ It is a proud product
of an individual family distillery
—every drop is 8 or more years
old—a consistent favorite in the
British Isles—and a happy har-
mony of all of the elements that
are necessary to move a Scotch
upward from standard accep-
tance into a more exalted, more
mellow, more appreciated area.
Recommended for gift-giving.

In his Encyclopedia, Frank Schoonmaker states, “Chateau
Bouscaut is one of the most important and best-tended vineyards
of the Graves district, south of Bordeaux.” It was classified in
1953 among the eleven top Graves vineyards making red wines
—a classification that also includes Chateau Haut-Brion and
Chateau La Mission Haut-Brion.

In the London Observer, Cyril Ray, one of Britain's leading
wine critics, states, “On two or three occasions recently, I have
tasted current vintages of Chateau Bouscaut, a fine full-bodied,
but far from heavy wine grown on a famous property only a five
mile bus ride from the center of Bordeaux. Chateau Bouscaut 1s
typical of a red Graves in developing more quickly than a com:
parable Médoc, yet lasting as long.”

Happy to add our own enthusiasm for Bouscaut (owned by a
group of wine-loving Americans), we present here a collection
of some of the Chateau’s recent, elegant vintages.
