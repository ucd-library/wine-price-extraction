SINGLE CASK UNBLENDED COGNAC
OF RARE OLD VINTAGE

The knowledgeable Cognac drinkers of France consider this the
best example of brandy produced in their country, regardless of
price, age, or package elegance. We now concur with that opinion,
aftér- much comparative tasting.

Here is an estate-bottled Cognac that was produced during.a-great
vintage year in.the most celebrated part of the Cognac country,
30A “Grande Fine Cham-

pagne.” It has re-
mained in its un-
blended state in barrel
from its birth until the
present date.
