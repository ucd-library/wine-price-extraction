RHONE VALLEY RED

These wines, among the best values in Europe, are produced
on both sides of the Rhone River starting below Lyon, and
proceeding 120 miles south as far as Avignon. In the opinion
of our most knowledgeable customers, the Cétes du Rhéne
Rouge, Vieille Ferme, which we offer, is possibly the best red
wine value in the United States. They also consider the Hermit-
age and Chateauneuf-du-Pape the equal of many Burgundies
that command much higher prices.

COTES DU RHONE ROUGE 1972......... 2.29 25.95
Makes bid for being the best red wine value available
in U.S. CRAIG CLAIBORNE has extolled its virtues in
his newsletter and drinks it as his daily wine. We dined
with the grower recently and he advised us that the
superiority of his red wine is not only based on his
excellent vinification, but also because he uses a higher
ratio of the superior grape variety, Petit Syrah, compared
to the more common Grenache grape of the area. What-
ever the reason, in several decades of being wine mer-
chants, we have never had a red wine that captured the
imagination of those who want a good $2.29 bottle of
red wine more effectively than this one. Also available
in half bottles and magnums at $3.00 the case additional.
SPECIAL OFFER~—If you buy 5 cases for a single delivery,
the cost would be only $120.00, or an added savings of
$9.75.

of red wine. Clape.

CGROZES HERMITAGE 1970 2 oo 6 ccs 3.59 38.75

HERMITAGE 1969) 2 26 es eo: 6.99 75.50

it as “the manliest wine” he has ever drunk.

WHITE WINES FROM ALSACE

Gratifying indeed to the economy-minded wine lover, the ex-
cellent dry white wines of Alsace have not followed the upward
price graph of other areas of France. Buy them now while they
are still bargains—ideally suited for the beach house or hillside
retreat.
