is considered the largest and most prestigious of the Champagne houses of
France. Emperor Napoleon, fresh from his Austrian victories, paid a state visit to the cellars in
1807 and took back a goodly supply.

The Brut Imperial—whether it be the vintage or non-vintage—has become world-renowned. The
crowning Jewel of Moet & Chandon—Dom Perignon—is famed around the globe and highly
rationed.

We recommend that you send the Champagne of Moet & Chandonasa sparkling holiday gift—
Or serve Moet to add distinction to your own holiday parties.
