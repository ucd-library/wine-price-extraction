A vigorous, well-balanced
red wine from the choice
Haut-Medoc area of Bordeaux
Fort Medoc 1973 is the proud
wine creation—representing
a long search for the best wines
of Bernard Ginestet, the
Director of Chateau Margaux.
The 1973 vintage was outstand-
ing in Bordeaux, and this
non-appellation wine can hold
its head high among Its
chateau-bottled neighbors
We recommend it
enthusiastically.
