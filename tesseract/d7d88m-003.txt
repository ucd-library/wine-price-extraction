1961 RED BORDEAUX - Available Fall-Winter 1963

Like the rockets that dominate our era, some of these prices may seem to you way out in space.
Actually, these are based on a low acquisition cost of last October and were the price based on
today's market, they could easily be 50% higher. As wine merchants, we cannot in good conscience
be indignant with the growers, because they have produced one of the great wines of our lifetime.
They have only achieved one-half of a normal crop and they certainly should not be asked to work
at a loss, because of low production in a year that will surely prove memorable.
to spurn these wines because of cost and ignore such an historic year.
buy them in great quantities for economic reasons; but, of course,
exclude this fabulous year from his cellar.

Perhaps the most eloquent testimony as to the greatness of the 196! red Burgundies, os
well as their scarcity, was supplied during the last November at the auction’ that sr
place at the Hospices de Beaune. Never, in the history of France, have red wines, in
the open market, commanded such astronomic prices — in many instances, double what
they obtained two years previously for the 1959s. Some of the old vignerons in Burgundy
shake their heads and state, "they never have we made wines of such quality in our
lifetime". Only the future will reveal whether this be so or not, but we i gules that
we have never experienced greater difficulty in obtaining wine, and finally “ —
were fortunate enough to get it, the quantity allocated to us was pitiably small. There
is no question but that this is the time to anticipate your 196! Burgundy requirements.
