Editor’s Note: Chateau Cheval Blanc
1949 is one of the greatest clarets we
have tasted for a decade. It is scarce and
hard to come by. It is available at
$21.00 the botile. As a suitable and
equally deep-flavored alternative, we
suggest Chateau Clos Fourtet 1959, an-
other superb St. Emilion, at $4.99 the
bottle.

 

‘At this point the dinner deserves a
pause, some pleasant relaxed conversa-
tion while we await the dessert. Here
again, we had intended that you order
the Buche de Noel or Yule Log from
Paris and have it sent in by air, but our
friend at Fauchon reports ‘How can it

be shipped to you? As you are aware,
it’s a fresh pastry, topped with Choco-
late butter cream, decorated with me-
ringue—the beautiful exterior will surely
be damaged, no matter how we packed
it.” I do not think you should attempt to
make your own Soke de Noel unless
you are highly skilled. It would be much
simpler to call Bloomingdale’s or your
favorite French Bakery in advance and
have him prepare one for you which you
will pick up the day before the dinner.
Mr. Gumpert, the food buyer of Bloom-
ingdale’s assures me that theirs are ex-
cellent and compares favorably with
those made in Paris. Something cool and
light will be required now. My favorite,
whether it be for Christmas or the year
round, is a Champagne Sherbet. It is
simple to make—anyone can do it—
provided you have a freezer or an elec-
tric mixer with a freezer attachment.
Actually, it can be made in the freezer
trays of the refrigerator. Directions are
given below.

“If the glamour of the dinner is to be
maintained at this point, we know of
nothing better to serve than the greatest
of Champagnes— Moet & Chandon Dom
Perignon 1961—in the dramatic and fes-
tive Magnum. After all, remember, we
are not compromising.”

Editor’s Note: We still have a few
cases of Moet & Chandon Dom Perignon
1961 in Magnums at $30.00 each,
$162.00 the case. As a less expensive
alternative, you might consider the regu-
lar size of Moet & Chandon Dry Impe-
rial Brut 1961—$9.45 the bottle, $102.06

the case.

“And now we come to the slow, pleas-
ant climax, when the nuts and fruits
are put on the table, the cigars are
brought forth, and the greatest Cognac
that one can find is served with hot,
strong coffee. I know of no Cognac that
compares with the Hine Family Reserve
which is the proud creation of the Hine
family who have been important in the
Cognac country since the 18th Century.
Most of this Cognac is from stocks that
date back to the early 19th Century, re-
freshed with somé younger brandy.
Each bottle is numbered and hand-
signed by Mr. Hine himself. Only 25
cases were shipped to the United States
in an entire year, for the Hines hate to
part with it—and I blame them not.”

Editor’s Note: The Hine Family Re-
serve Cognac is the greatest single Co-
gnac we have ever offered. As a possible
alternative, you might consider the

Single Cask Unblended Cognac.

DOUBLE TURKEY CONSOMME

The time from start to finish is rela-
tively long, but very little attention is re-
quired during the process. In any event,
even if there were more trouble in the
preparing, the results would be worth the
effort.

Purchase about 4 pounds of turkey
parts from a good market. I usually buy 2
pounds gizzards and 2 pounds necks and
backs or sometimes just the back section.
Place in an 8 or 10 quart pot with water
to cover, with an inch or so above. Bring
to a boil rapidly and skim off any scum
which rises to the surface during the first
ten minutes of boiling. Reduce the heat
to simmer and cover the pot and let it
simmer for 6 to 8 hours very, very slowly,
with what the French sometimes refer to
as a feeble ebullition.

When it has cooked thoroughly, strain
into a large bowl and discard the meat and
bones—allow to cool. Cover and place in
the refrigerator for 24 to 36 hours. Pur-
chase 2 turkey legs and thighs or two or
three legs. Carefully skim the fat from the
broth and place the new meat in the pot
with the broth. Bring to a boil and skim
off any scum. Cover and reduce the heat
to simmer and simmer for 5 to 6 hours.
Allow to cool and strain into a large bowl.
Discard the meat. Chill in the refrigerator
for several hours, or overnight. Remove
fat carefully and taste the jelly, for that is
what you will have by that time, for the
proper proportion of salt. It should need
no other seasoning—for the true essence
of turkey is enough. Add salt to a pot and
add the jelly and heat over medium heat.
Bring to a boil and boil rapidly for 30
minutes. Cool to lukewarm, or cold. Beat
3 or four egg whites lightly and put into
the broth, returning it to the fire. Heat to
boiling, whisking with a metal whisk till
the broth comes through the oil and the
egg white rises to the surface. Strain the
broth through a linen towel or several
thicknesses of cheese cloth and it is now
ready for serving. You will have about 12
cups of double consommé.
