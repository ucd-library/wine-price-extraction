“147A.” The book ‘‘Dionysus”’ is a delightful treasury of wine lore inspired by Clifton Fadiman’s love of the grape. One of his great
loves is the wine produced at the Domaine de la Romanée Conti and we share this enthusiasm with him.

We are presently conducting a personal rebellion against fashion. Fashion decrees that 1959 is better than 1958 everywhere in
Burgundy, including ROMANEE CONTI. However, our taste buds indicate, after five comparative tastings, that 1958 here is not
only inspired wine, but better than the '59s—at least for present drinking. Therefore, while the tiny stocks of this great wine—rela-
tively light, but in perfect balance—can still be obtained, we urge that you send it to yourself as well as to your friends.

A wine lover’s dream can easily be waking on Christmas morning and
seeing under the tree a handsome wine rack (4.95) holding FOUR
BOTTLES EACH of Grands Echezeaux (5.79 ea.), Richebourg (7.85
ea.), and La Tache (8.33 ea.)—all from the Domaine de la Romanée
Conti! COMPLETE WITH WINE RACK. 92.83

‘17B.” The first samples of this attractive all-pur-
pose (and we mean all-purpose) TOTE AND
TRAVEL BAG reached us during mid-November.
Wives, secretaries and even customers insisted on
getting one immediately. Happily, we report that
the first dozen samples have been replaced by a
substantial shipment.

We are still excited by its beauty and usefulness
and we think you will be too. It is generous in size,
and can hold any six bottles of your choice. It is
light, strong, and so efficiently insulated that it will
keep cold things cold for hours. It can be used as
an oversized hand-bag, as a seat companion for
an airplane trip, beach parties, ski weekends,
and picnic food-carrier.

Pictured here is the TOTE AND TRAVEL BAG
