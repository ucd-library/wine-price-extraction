Exciting news for Scotch drinkers! You can
start your Fall entertaining by serving one of
Scotland's most distinguished whiskies and
yet pay the unbelievably low sale price of only
$4.59. Don't let the low price deceive you -_
this whisky has been carefully blended, aged
and bottled by the 178 year old firm of
Alexander Sommervail. Frankly, fine Scotch
whisky of this pedigree, age and mellowness
would be good value at $6. 00 or more - at this
low price, it is nothing short of sensational!
