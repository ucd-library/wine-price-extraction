Bottle Case

PIESPORTER MICHELSBERG, W. Dunweg 25%, Deo
Not even the thriftiest of the Moselle Burgermeisters can buy a wine

disappear quickly - suggest you anticipate your spring needs now.

RUDES HEIMER BURWEG, Winzergenossenschaft LE 34,10

1973, wines grown along the steep Rudesheimer hills reached a

richness that was never achieved by its neighboring villages.

MUSCADET-SUR-LIE 1975, Chateau de Briace

'Sur-Lie' means that the wine never left the original barrel and the

contents were taken out from above, leaving the lees behind. This
ee is a more costly and wasteful process,

but the result is that you get Muscadet

beauty with more intense flavor. This

| ae beauty is estate-bottled by Chateau de

\Chiteauie Pace | Briace and won First Award in a recent

apetitin sd i fil blind tasting among Muscadets which

SANCERRE 1975, Clos de la Perriere

MUSCADET-SUR-LIE 1976, Marquis de Goulaine
Though it bears the simple name ‘Muscadet,’
we offer an utterly amazing wine here!
1976 is probably the best vintage pro-
duced during this generation in the
Loire. The Marquis de Goulaine

owns the choicest vineyard land

of Muscadet which surrounds his

1000- year-old moated chateau.

In the 12th Century, Mathieu de Goulaine
three times achieved peace between Henry|!ofEngland, and Louis VII of France.
In recognition, each monarch granted Goulaine the right to bear
the royal coat of arms of his country. Hence the unique Goulaine arms :
Leopards of England and Fleurs de Lys of France. This is also the origin
of the family motto :
“ A CESTUY-CI, A CESTUY-LA, J'ACCORDE LES COURONNES”
(the three “A”, and the two royal crowns).

SARAN NATURE STILL CHAMPAGNE

A rarity from the 18th century Chateau of Moet & Chandon
Presented in the graceful Dom Perigon bottle

 

IN ITS OWN QUIET WAY, unheralded by the sound of popping corks,
Chateau de Saran reflects the heart of the Champagne district. It is
produced from only the best Pinot Chardonnay grapes. Its elegance
is dramatic - extreme dryness married with wonderful fruitiness - this is

non-sparkling Champagne at its best!

For decades, SARAN NATURE was legally prohibited by French edict
from being exported. Only for the past year has it been possible for
New Yorkers to share its distinction with Frenchmen who are imbibing
it proudly and joyously at such gastronomic shrines as Maxim's, Mere
Charles, Taillevent, Troisgros, Paul Bocuse, Michel Guerard, Moulin
de Mougins, and L'Oasis.

SARAN NATURE, a true rival of Montrachet for the dry white crown
of France, is produced in limited quantity. It is rationed in France,
Cr retire and the shipment to America is pitifully small. We are happy to be
Dre

able to offer it to you so you can share its crisp dryness, elegance,
tr

haunting bouquet and perfect balance with the sophisticated and
appreciative wine drinkers of Paris.

If you have never tasted it, we urge that you try it. If you already
have experienced SARAN NATURE, you know how deliciously won-
derful this wine can be.
