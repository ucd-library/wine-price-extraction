RED BORDEAUX

A great, great claret year and a worthy successor to the classic
1961’s. The wines have now arrived, and can be delivered immedi-
ately. The prices will surge upwards quickly this Fall because of
the relative failure of the 1968’s and the astronomically high open-
ing prices that the 1969 Clarets have commanded on the Bordeaux
market.

Exceptionally fine, soft, fruity, quick maturing — but likely to have
‘ts excellence overlooked since it never shared in the publicity
drum-beating that was showered on both 1966 and 1969.

World wine news was made when the Bordeaux growers launched
1969 as a ‘grande année’ and promptly quoted opening prices that
were 40% higher than 1967. This was natural, because 1969 fol-
lowed a dismal 1968 vintage and ’69 provided only half of a normal
crop. Here are classic clarets, slow to mature, possessed of wiry
stamina and longevity — ideal for laying down.
