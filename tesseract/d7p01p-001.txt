BARRISTER’S CHOICE ° e ° ° e ° ° ° e ° ° ° e ° ° e ° 5.79 66.50
Our research does not quite explain why Barristers have chosen this particular brand of whisky above others, but we certainly
cannot accuse them of bad taste. The dignified label, proudly bearing the smiling countenance of a Barrister, carries behind
it, within the bottle, one of the most successful blends we have ever offered.

FORTINGINT © MASONS RED SEAL =. a ww sD 68.50

Fortnum & Mason recently celebrated the 250th anniversary of its founding in London. The whisky demonstrates great dis-
tinction, excellent balance, and the smoothness that is rarely matched by any whisky that sells below $7.00 the bottle.
