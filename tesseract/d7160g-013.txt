be the most remarkable of all Europe. The reputa-
tion of Hooper’s was of such exceptional merit to
earn the warrant as Port purveyors to the British
House of Lords as far back as 1912 — no mean ac-
complishment in a country that boasts of having
the most discriminating and serious Port imbibers
in the world.

One of the noblest of the world’s great wines is
undoubtedly an authentic Vintage Port that has
achieved its maturation, like fine still wine, in bot-
tle rather than in cask. If you have not experienced
its vinous joy, we strongly advise that vou acquire
some for your own pleasure.
