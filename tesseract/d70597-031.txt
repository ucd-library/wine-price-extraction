 

THE WINES OF ITALY

With the prices of many of the famed wines of the world going
up dramatically during the last year, there has been a tendency
for many wine drinkers to turn to Italy to provide good wine
at liberal prices. We have taken the challenge seriously, we
have searched out the best that Italy has to offer, and our taste
selections appear below. Gattinara, Barolo and Carema will
astonish you by their excellence. However, in addition to seek-
ing out the gems, we have concentrated on good Italian red
and white wine designed to provide drinking joy for those who
want to acquire their wines at the lowest possible prices. We
particularly bring to your attention the litre of red and white
wine, and the giant sized bottles of Chianti and the dry white
wine of Tuscany. The sources of all of these wines are impec-
cable—we suggest you experiment by buying at least a bottle
of any of them that arouses your curiosity.

highly popular red wine grown not far from Bologna.
Emilia Vini.
CHIANTI MONTEPALDI 1970 ........--. 1.99 21.50
Marchesi Corsini is famed throughout Italy for his re-
markable ‘Riserva’ which is listed below. Even this mod-
estly priced red reflects his dedication and excellence.
BARDOLINO 2070 oo ns ke ro ee op eas 1.99 21.50
A refreshing, fruity, light red wine grown along the
shores of Lake Garda. Low price for its outstanding
quality. V. Petternella.
WVATPOL ACs TOT oe se es 1.99 21.50
Pleasing, ever-popular, fruity light red wine grown near
Verona. Similar to a Beaujolais. Excellent example. V.
Patternella.
CHIANTI CLASSICO 1966 ..............- 2.49 26.90
The family of Marchesi Corsini claim three Popes as part
of their heritage. He owns some of the best vineyard
land of Tuscany, and this ‘Riserva’ is considered one of
the best red wines produced in Italy. Worth at least $1.00
the bottle more.
BARBERA -1969 | ....3.: 3.0. 2.79 30.15
Deep-colored, full-bodied, rich in flavor. Excellent when
young and this wine should be consumed within the next
two or three years. Cherosco-La Morra.
DOLEGELLO 1970...) ss 2.99 32.30
Grown on the high slopes of the Piedmont. Soft, quick to
drink, delightful. Cherosco-La Morra.

CHIANTI SERRISTORI 1970 res
(In Handsome Gigantic 59 oz. Bottle) ... 3.49 19.95
Attention should be paid here! Here is a gay, generous,
gigantic bottle, equal to about two and a half regular
bottles, that comes out less than 6¢ per ounce! Hardly
more than beer! The wine is not just good, but comes
from the cellars of Conti Serristori, one of the most re-
spected growers of Tuscany. The heritage is impeccable
—it was selected for us by Frank Schoonmaker and the
combination of his enthusiasm and what we tasted, per-
suaded us to bring it to you. The first shipment is not
too large so we strongly urge that you acquire a case
immediately, thus permitting you to serve good, honest
red wine, freely, with pride, and at minimum cost.
GHIANTI RISERVA (2... .2.2....2.55.... 3.75 40.50
Demonstrates clearly the excellence that Chianti can
achieve. Estate-bottled, Castle of Brolio.
er, FU i ee ta 46 ioe as 3.79 40.95
The wine lovers of Italy are so fond of Carema that
rarely is it ever exported. Made from the Nebbiolo grape
north of Turin. Superb. Luigi Ferrando.
BARQOEO 1966. 3... 3.3.3 es 3.99 43.10
Here again, Frank Schoonmaker is proud of this discov-
ery which he found among the hills of Piedmont. We
share his opinion that Barolo is perhaps the best red
wine of all Italy; full-bodied, slow-maturing and com-
parable to a top flight Rhone Valley red. Generally kept
at least three years in wood and then put in ‘Burgundy’
bottles. Powerful, definitely belongs in the ranks of great
red wines.

of Lake Maggiore. Full-bodied, slow to mature, long-
lived. Can hold its own against the best red wines of the
Rhone Valley. Hard to come by. Antoniolla.

The Chateau Lafite of Italy. Remarkable. Estate-bottled,

do not approach greatness, please try this one. Cherosco-

La Morra.
ITALIAN WHITE WINES
bee WRRASOAT (068 es: 1.79 19.95

While dining at the Grand Hotel in Rome, we were
amazed by the Frascati they served us—way beyond the
class of any other we experienced. The Grand Hotel
Manager then told us that it comes from the Valle
Vermiglia vineyard, owned by Pietro Campilli, now
Presidet of Italy’s National Economic Council and until
recently, President of Edison Montecatini. Perhaps it
was his devotion to excellence in whatever field he may
be engaged that permitted Mr. Campilli to produce this
agreeable and refreshing white wine.

614 BIANCO DI VERONA 1970

(Full 3342 oz. litre) ..........--.-+--+-- 1.79 19.95

FANK SCHOONMAKER again brings joy to the wine
lovers of America. Here is a delicate, dry, eminently sat-
isfying white wine that is the equal of the best Soave you
have ever tasted.

613°. SOAVE-1970 | ::.-:... 1.99 21.50
Perhaps we are prejudiced, but we consider this the best
dry white wine of all Italy. V. Petternella.

Here is the dry white counterpart of the Chianti Ser-
ristori described above. The cost is less than 6¢ per
ounce—do you know of a better bargain in good dry
white wine? It is clean, dry, honest and designed to
cheer. Several of our friends have already started to
make lamps out of the bottle after they have joyously
consumed the contents. Quantity limited—please act
quickly to avoid disappointment.
