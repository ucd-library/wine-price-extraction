The “Miniature Wine Cellar” pictured above will make a most useful and im: iginative

gift that would be particularly appreciated by any of your wine drinking friends. And the
cost of the gift can be as modest or as luxurious as you wish—simply pick a mixed assort-
ment (or a whole case, if you prefer) of any twelve bottles listed on the next page — add

only $4.95 for the JAMES BEARD WINE RACK (retails regularly at $9.95 )

In our opinion, the “Wine Rack” pictured above is the most effective solution we have yet
seen to the problem of wine storage. Its advantages are manifold — it is extremely hand-
some... made of sturdy, hard wood and strong metal, it will last indefinitely ... and, best
of all, it can fit into almost any space since it can stand vertic: uly, horizontally, or even be
hung on the wall...and if more than one is acquired, the racks can be built up like blocks

)
one upon the ee Filled with twelve bottles, it becomes a most original, exciting gift.
