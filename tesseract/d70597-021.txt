The Loire meanders for over 600 miles through France and
wine is grown along its banks from the Atlantic Ocean almost
up to Lyon. Because of the vast area, Loire wines include a
wide and interesting diversity of both whites and reds ranging
from the acceptable to the outstanding. Here are the best.

SAUMUR CHAMPIGNY 1969 .......----- 2.79 30.15
Champigny was the favorite of Clemenceau and this
red wine still sells under the slogan “Le tigre en buvait
aussi.”

ST. NICHOLAS BOURGUEIL 1969 ......- 2.89 31.20
Higher up in the hills from Chinon. Excellent. Estate-
bottled, Couly.

GHINON 1960 «2. 2. we ices oe 2.99 32.30
The birthplace of Rabelais yields a light, fresh, red wine.
Best when young. Most consumed locally. Try it lightly
chilled—delightful. Estate-bottled, Couly.

Ome PLANT 1071 ...--.-.-26seeee ress 1.79 19.35
Fresh, light, dry white wine grown near the mouth of the
Loire at Nantes. Ideal accompaniment to shellfish. Estate-
bottled, Drouet Freres.

ANJOU MEANG 1070 . ore ce eee 1.99 21.50
Astonishing price for a dry white Loire of this estate-
bottled caliber. Lovingly grown and bottled by
Savennieres.

ANJOU BLANC MELLOW 1970 .........- 1.99 21.50
Rich, fruity, reflects the ‘Loire, garden of France.’
Savennieres.

MUSCADET BEAUREGARD 1970 ......- 2.19 23.65
Near Nantes, as the Loire empties into the Atlantic, can
be found the vineyards of Muscadet. Dry, light, easy to
drink, here is the wine that is enchanting Paris today.
MUSCADET-SUR-LIE 1971 ......-------: 2.59 27.95
‘Sur-Lie’ means that the wine never left the original
barrel and the contents were taken out from above leav-
ing the lees behind. This is a more costly and wasteful
process, but the result is that you get Muscadet with
more intense flavor. This beauty is estate-bottled by
Chateau Briacé and won First Award in a blind tasting
among Muscadets that was held recently in Paris.
SANCERRE CHAVIGNOL 1970 ........-- 2.99 32.30
Chavignol is famed for its small rounds of goat cheese;
it is equally known for the Sancerre it produces, since
it is considered the best wine commune of the Sancerre
area. Estate-bottled, Cherrier.

WOUVRAY 1969 3 coos so voce ce ees cers 3.19 34.45

Vouvray” resounds. Estate-bottled, Diard.

POUILLY BLANC FUME 1970 ........-.. 3.29 35.40
Georges Gaudry is the estate-bottler here. Don’t let the
relatively low price dissuade you. In truth, this wine
makes a serious bid to being the best single dry white
wine produced in the charming wine town of Pouilly-
sur-Loire.

CO AINGER RE: 1970 5 onc 6k gee 5 ee ct ec ee 4.00 43.20

famed and most sought-after vineyard of the district.
POUILLY BLANC FUME 1970 .........-. 4.50 48.60
Ladoucette, the best single source of white wine in the
entire Loire, sends us this glorious dry white wine—the
very wine featured in outstanding restaurants of Paris,
London and New York. Particularly outstanding in the
1970 vintage.

The choicest vineyards of Alsace are on the slopes of the
Vosges Mountains starting from Mulhouse continuing north to
Strasbourg. The Alsatian wines are usually named after the
grape from which they are made such as Sylvaner, Riesling,
Gewurztraminer, etc. Their distinguishing characteristics are
flowery fragrance, relatively dry, but fruity.

Superior example of the spicy grape from Trimbach.

668 GEWURZTRAMINER SPATLESE 1969 ... 3.49 37.70
Just as in Germany, a late picking in Alsace, which gives
greater richness, bears the name ‘Spatlese.’ Rich, lux-
urious. Trimbach.

941 GEWURZTRAMINER GRAND CRU 1969.. 3.80 41.04
The ‘Grand Crw’ is to Alsace what a ‘First Growth’ is to
Bordeaux—one of the best of the area. F. Hugel.

490 CLOS ST. HUNE 1970 ......-----+-eeeee5 3.99 43.10
This is the very wine that was served by General De
Gaulle when he entertained President Nixon at the
Elysées Palace. Makes a bid to being considered the
