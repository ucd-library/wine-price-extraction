1961 VINTAGE

No. Bottle Case
237 CHATEAU BELAIR (St. Emilion).... 4.49 48.50

There are 12 ‘‘First Great Growths”’ in the 1955 St. Emilion official classi-
fication. Chateau Belair is one of them. The vineyard is owned by
Chateau Ausone, the vines are adjacent, and the wine is matured in the
Ausone cellar. The distinction between Belair and Ausone can be de-
tected only by the most professional taster.

566 CHATEAU SIRAN (Margaux) ...... 4.49 48.50
A noble vineyard in Margaux that has been saluted in the Time-Life wine
book as one of the 11 Medoc vineyards worthy of being ranked with the
growths recognized in the 1855 classification. Owned by Alain Miailhe,
proprietor of Pichon Longueville Lalande and co-proprietor of Chateau
Palmer. A truly great Claret at relatively modest cost.

434 CHATEAU PRIEURE LICHINE
Be oe ee ee es, 4.49 48.50

Alexis Lichine also produced Chateau Lascombes which sells for $7.50
the bottle. In 1961, I do believe that Mr. Lichine has produced a wine in
the same league as Lascombes itself. Sensationally priced at only $4.49.

595 CHATEAU LYNCH BAGES

We ee 4.79 51.75

5th-growth Medoc—originally the property of an Irishman, Mr. Lynch,
who was Mayor of Bordeaux. Rich, full, round.

288 CHATEAU BRANE CANTENACG
Wyereeeel ok 5.09 55.00

For a while, this great vineyard, a second-growth Medoc, languished,
but under the dedicated, creative leadership of the proprietor, Lucien
Lurton, it has flourished to a point where its delicacy and softness and
bouquet puts it among the first-rank in Margaux.

630 CHATEAU LEOVILLE LASCASES
ee en eee 5.49 59.30

The vinyard stretches from the town of St. Julien to the borders of
Chateau Latour. Produces almost 20,000 cases of truly excellent wine
each year. However, in 1961 they were able to make only 9,000 cases of
concentrated, superb, long-lived wine.

804 CHATEAU CANON (St. Emilion) ... 5.49 59.30

A ‘first great growth’ of St. Emilion. Soft, generous, with considerable
finesse.

615 CHATEAU BEYCHEVELLE

eee 5.99 64.70
Proudly owned by M. Achille-Fould, former Minister of Agriculture. The
wine has developed a world reputation for excellence and prestige, thus
making it one of the most expensive wines of Bordeaux.

114 CHATEAU CALON SEGUR
[ee eereee) § 5.99 64.70

Quality at the expense of quantity is the standard procedure at Calon
Segur. Thus, the wine is slow to mature, it is perhaps the most long-lived
of all, and it has achieved a special kind of wine immortality in 1961.

LGLARETS

We quote from the new wine classic, the Time-Life book
on Wines and Spirits, “1961 RED BORDEAUX—one of
the best years of the century, the equal of 1945. Unfortu-
nately, the crop was about half the normal size. The
grapes were well-nourished, resulting in concentrated
wines, rich in every quality including color, body, bou-
quet, and fruit. They are the most long-lived wines of our
generation in the classic tradition. 20 out of a possible
20 very, very great”. There is little that we can add to
this other than to say that the 1961s have gone up 40%
in Bordeaux during the last year if one is fortunate
enough to be able to obtain any of the great ones at all.

584 CARRUADES DE CHATEAU LAFITE

ROTHSCHILD (Pauillac) ........... 8.95 96.75
Many believe this second wine of Chateau Lafite Rothschild, from the
same soil, is showing better today than Lafite itself because of quicker
maturation. A fantastic Claret.

568 CHATEAU LA MISSION HAUT
BERN [G@laves) 22.7... yt: 9.49 102.50

Velvety, generous and fine. Lighter and matures more quickly than its
neighbor, Chateau Haut Brion.

609 CHATEAU AUSONE (St. Emilion). ..10.95 118.00

Did not follow the spiraling price graph of the other great ’61 Clarets.
In the same league as Cheval Blanc ’61 but not much more than half the
price.

207 CHATEAU MARGAUX (Margaux)...13.50 145.80

A handsome colonnaded Chateau was built in about 1820 by a pupil of
Victor Louis, architect of the Bordeaux Opera House. It is now owned
by the Ginestet family who have restored its magnificence. Very elegant,
beautifully balanced, relatively quick to develop, reach great heights
in 1961.

158 CHATEAU HAUT BRION (Graves) . .14.50 156.60

The vineyard is owned by Clarence Dillon and his son, Douglas Dillon,
formerly our Secretary of the Treasury. It is reigned over in exraordinary
fashion and with complete dedication to quality by the beloved Seymour
Weller, one of the most knowledgeable wine authorities of France. The
wine is relatively full, combines power with elegance; and this 1961
promises to live another 50 years.

195 CHATEAU LATOUR (Pauillac) ..... 17.50 189.00

Montaigne, a citizen of Bordeaux, spoke about Chateau Latour in his
“essays”. In 1963, the dominant owner became Lord Cowdray, one of
England’s prime social and financial figures. This 1961 is firm, rich, noble,
and requires some more aging to bring out its true worth.

218 CHATEAU MOUTON
ROTHSCHILD (Pauillac) ........... 17.50 189.00

The name, Mouton, is evidently based on the fact that Moutons, or
sheep, grazed on the property (that is where the expression ‘‘Pauillac
lamb” was born). It is now owned by the brilliant Baron Philippe de
Rothschild who devotes as much time to the vineyard as he does to his
poetry and museum. Since it is made exclusively of cabernet sauvignon
grapes, the wine is long-lived.

144 CHATEAU CHEVAL BLANG
it Pigmen) 18.00 194.40

Very great, very rare, tremendous life ahead.

203 CHATEAU LAFITE ROTHSCHILD
oC 23.50 253.80

Many consider Lafite the greatest single red wine vineyard in the world.
It is owned by Baron Elie de Rothschild, the cousin of Philippe, who
reigns at Mouton. A special kind of friendly wine competition has re-
sulted between them. Lafite has great finesse, a unique softness,
delicacy, with the breed of a thoroughbred racehorse—in contrast to

Mouton where weight, depth and power are the distinguishing char-
acteristics.
