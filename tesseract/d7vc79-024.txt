MUSCADET-SUR-LIE 1970 2.19 23.65
‘Sur-Lie’ means that the wine never left the original barrel
and the contents were taken out from above leaving the lees
behind. This is a more costly and wasteful process, but the
result is that you get Muscadet with more intense flavor. This
beauty is estate-bottled by Chateau Briacé and won First
Award in a blind tasting among Muscadets that was held
recently in Paris.
QUINCY 1970 2.99 27.95
A dry white wine of much character. Kstate-bottled, Georges
Mounier.
POUILLY BLANC FUME 1970 2.99 32.30
Georges Gaudry is the estate-bottler here. Don’t let the rela-
tively low price dissuade you. In truth, this wine makes a
serious bid to being the best single dry white wine produced
in the charming wine town of Pouilly-sur-Loire.
SANCERRE CHAVIGNOL 1970 2.99 32.30
Chavignol is famed for its small rounds of goat cheese; it is
equally known for the Sancerre it produces, since it is con-
sidered the best wine commune of the Sancerre area. Estate-
bottled, Vincent Delaporte.
SANCERRE 1969 3.76 40.65
Estate-bottled, Chateau de Sancerre. This is the most famed
and most sought-after vineyard of the district.
POUILLY BLANC FUME 1969 4.26 16.35
Here is the very wine featured in outstanding restaurants of
Paris, London, and New York. La Doucette.

THE WINES OF THE

RHONE VALLEY

The Rhone river starts in Switzerland and empties into the Mediter-
ranean. Red and white wines flourish along its entire length. The
important wine section is south of Lyon and includes all of the
world-famed names listed below.

COTES DU RHONE 1969........ 1.79 19.35
Not to be ignored by anyone interested in drinking good,
sound, honest everyday red wine at a price so low that even
a thrifty Frenchman would express enthusiasm. Here is the
very wine served so proudly at the small country inns that
surround Avignon and Nimes. Also available in half bottles
at 1.04 each, 22.35 the case of 24.

CROZES HERMITAGE 1970 1.99 21.50
From vineyards surrounding Hermitage overlooking the
Rhone Valley. Similar in characteristics to Hermitage itself,
but with a little less depth, maturing more quickly—how-
ever, it is considerably less expensive. Bottled by Nicolas.
CHATEAUNEUF-DU-PAPE 1969 2.69 29.05
The 1969 vintage proved eminently successful at the Do-
maine de Beaucastel. It is enjoyable for present drinking,
but will be ever better if you put it away in your cellar for a
year or two.

CHATEAUNEUF-DU-PAPE 1967 2.99 32.30
Estate-bottled, Domaine de Beaucastel. Impeccable source.
Sturdy, deep in color, full-bodied, excellent.

ST. JOSEPH 1969 2.99 32.30
One bank of the Rhone River produces Hermitage—the
opposite bank produces St. Joseph. The grape varieties and
taste qualities are similar, although the Hermitage generally
reaches more exalted heights. Estate-bottled, Florentin.
CHATEAUNEUF-DU-PAPE 1964 3.39 36.60
Estate-bottled, Domaine de Beaucastel. Here is the same
wine with three additional years of bottle age—hence better
rounded, more subtle.

HERMITAGE 1967 . 3.69 39.85
Produced on a very steep terraced hillside about 40 miles
south of Lyon. Referred to by Georges Saintsbury as “the
manliest of all wines.” Estate-bottled, Chave.

COTE ROTIE 1967 a 3.79 40.95
Produced at a celebrated vineyard only a five minute drive
south of the famed Pyramide Restaurant in Vienne. The
incredibly steep vineyard faces due south, held up by sturdy
retaining walls, and everything must be cultivated by hand.
Deep in color, full bodied, amazingly long life, and every-
one looks for the aroma of violets when they drink ‘Cote
Rotie.’ Estate-bottled, Gerin.

BLANC 1969 2.99 32.30
A rarity—not easy to come by—dry. Estate-bottled, Domaine
de Beaucastel.
HERMITAGE BLANC 1970 3.85 41.60
Estate-bottled, Chante Alouette. Great character, among the
longest lasting of all dry white wines.
CONDRIEU 1970 6.95 73.05
Condrieu is located about three miles south of Cote Rotie
on the Rhone. The wine is dry with a unique flowery scent
and an almost “spicy” aftertaste. A wine of great breed and
unusual character which is best in its youth. One of our
favorites. Estate-bottled, Vernay.
CHATEAU GRILLET 1969 16.50 178.20
The rarest wine in all of France. Only 185 cases produced
annually. First importation into America—highly rationed,
dry, unique.

THE WINES OF SWITZERLAND

This is the time of year that the more athletic Americans go to
Switzerland to ski its peaks; learn to like their crisp white wines;
look for them when they come back to the states. Here are several
outstanding examples.

The most popular white wine of Switzerland grown along
the shores of Lake Neuchatel, not far from the French
border.

CHATEAU DU CHILLON 1968...... 2.595 27.50
Rumor has it that the prisoner of Chillon made his life
bearable by drinking the wine grown just outside his prison
walls along Lake Geneva. Crisp, bone dry.

FENDANT DU VALAIS 1970........ 2.79 29.15
Fendant is the name of the most popular grape used in this
mountainous country. Light, fresh, dry, agreeable.

DOLE ROUGE 1970... 7. = 3.59 38.75
Made primarily from the Pinot Noir grape. Switzerland’s
best red wine, similar to Beaujolais in fruit, lightness and
easy drinkability.
JOHANNISBERG NOVEMBRE

1967 (Gilliard) ............... 7s 3.69 39.85
The Swiss respected the Riesling grape of the Rheingau and
brought it to the suburbs of Lausanne, from which this white
wine comes. Some consider this the best wine of Switzerland.
AIGLE 1968 (Les Murailles).......... 3.79 40.85
At the eastern end of Lake Geneva, in the Canton of Vaud,
there are wonderful vineyards in Aigle. Has all the crisp
freshness of a mountain wine.
