 

SPANISH TABLE WINES

 

 

 

There is more vineyard land in Spain than in any other country in the

world -- and less than 3% is Sherry. You will find remarkable wine values
here. Choose among these full, flavorsome wines -- and top your list with the
light, fresh, fruity wines from Marques de Caceres.

No. Bottle Case
960 MARQUES DE CACERES 1973 (Alta Rioja) on 90 43.10

Our own favorite! So similar to first-rate claret that :
we feature it our Bordeaux listings. See box below for details.

404 TORRES CORONAS 1976 (Penedes) 3.99 43.10
Full, beautifully-made red from a distinguished family
firm based in the Penedes, south of Barcelona.

 

430 MARQUES DE CACERES BLANCO 1979 4.49 48.50
Light, dry, with a refreshing taste that has just a
hint of apples. Possibly Spain's best white wine.

aay MARQUES DE RISCAL 1975 (Rioja) 4.99 98.50
A fine red found on wine lists of the world's best Spanish restaurants.

930 MARQUES DE CACERES RESERVA 1970 (Alta Rioja) 7.99 86.50
When we first introduced Marques de Caceres to America,
the vintage was the rich, superb 1970. Here is a '70
once again -- this time a RESERVA,which means the wine

has been aged for years in wood. Incredible concentration

and intensity. Will mature for years -- like a great Red Bordeaux.
