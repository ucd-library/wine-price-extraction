RED BORDEAUX

SANS-ANNEE

These two wines should not be overlooked. The Simplet is
beautifully balanced and a delight. The Chateau Bahans
Haut Brion was grown at the famed Chateau Haut Brion
vineyard and is a blend of the 1964 and 1965 vintages. Ex-
traordinary opportunity for those who want truly outstand-
ing wine at relatively modest cost.

1969 CHATEAU BOTTLED

Because of half a normal production, the opening prices of
the 1969 was record breaking. They are still in barrel and are
showing well. The better Chateau bottlings should reach our
cellars between the Fall of 1971 and the Spring of 1972. We
will keep you advised as to their progress and will offer them
after their arrival. They are worth waiting for.

1968 CHATEAU BOTTLED

Certainly, the 68s are better than the ’63s or *65s. The great
vineyards, through selection and reduction of total quantity
have been able to provide excellent wines, equalling the
1960s. They are starting to arrive but we do think they re-
quire a few more months of bottle age. We will offer them
during the Fall-Winter of 1971. The prices will be relatively
modest and they will be ready for drinking.

1967 CHATEAU BOTTLED

Exceptionally fine, soft, fruity, quick maturing—but likely to have
its excellence overlooked since it never shared in the publicity drum-

beating that was showered on both 1966 and 1969.

The rule here must be selection. Entirely delightful wines
were produced at some chateaux, whereas others produced
light and inconsequential wines. Based on our tastings, we
single out below two examples that will provide eminent
drinking pleasure at relatively modest cost.

CHATEAU PICHON LALANDE ....... 2.79 30.15
We do not know what they did at this Pauillac vineyard to
make their 1965 so delightful—but we feel we would be re-
miss if we did not bring this one to your attention.

CHATEAU HAUT BRION.... 4.89 52.80
This First Growth Graves commands over $60 the case,
wholesale, in Bordeaux. The nobility of the soil, the care
and selection, the dedication—all are reflected here in the
elegance, balance, bouquet and satisfying taste. True, this is
not a wine for laying down—but if you want to experience
the kind of grace that a Chateau Haut Brion can bestow—
and you are selecting wines to be consumed during the next
two or three years, to be served proudly at even the most
distinguished of dinner parties—we do not think you should
overlook Chateau Haut Brion 1965.
