During a recent lunch with Alexis Lichine, he stated that the
best of red Bordeaux for current drinking is the 1967 vintage.

Bottle

We are inclined to agree. The happy economic aspect is the

fact that they do not cost quite as much as the less-ready ’66s

and ’64s. You will find them exceptionally soft, fruity, and
utterly delicious for current drinking, and for the next 5 to 8
years.

in light of excellence and background.

A ‘Grand Cru’ St. Emilion, the proud property of Marcel
Dassault, the creator of the Mystére and Mirage air-
planes.

CHATEAU BOUSGAUrR = 2 33 6.69 72.25
Classified ‘Grand Cru’ Graves. Owned by a distinguished
group of Americans. Its 18th Century chateau is con-
sidered one of the most beautiful examples of archi-
tecture in southwest France. The proprietors invite our
clientele to visit the chateau when next in Bordeaux.

CHATEAU DE PED 22). 20 6.99 75.50
From one of the best vineyards of St. Estephe.
CHATEAU MARQUIS DE TERME....... 6.99 75.50

Attention should be paid here! We are dealing with a
great growth of Margaux, classified in 1855. Fine texture,
very elegant, will live long—averages only 7,500 cases
a year. Worth much more.

GHATEAU GRUAUD LAROSE..... 2.2, 9.95 107.45
Sold for $17.00 the bottle last month—a superb St. Julien.
CHATEAU LEOVILLE POYFERRE....... 10.95 118.25
One of the greats of St. Julien.

GHATEAU LEOVILLE LASCASES....... 10.95 118.25

This St. Julien vineyard is starting to move into the
exalted class of the ‘first growths.’

CHATEAU LYNCH BAGES ...... ..)... 12.95 139.85
Outstanding Pauillac that is similar in constitution to
its neighbor, Mouton Rothschild.

GHATEAU MONTROSE .... 3.2. 2). 13,95 ..150.65
The most long-lived of the St. Estephes.

CHATEAU DUCRU BEAUCAILLOU...... 13.95 150.65
The chief competitor in St. Julien to Beychevelle.
GHATEAU CALON SEGUK..-. 22.7... 14.95 161.45

Perhaps the best single example of St. Estephe produced
during 1967.

GHATEAU HAUT BSRION.... 2. ss 21.95 237.00
Costs 1,320 francs in Bordeaux today or $270.60. Will
go higher. A truly great wine.

CHATEAU CHEVAL BLANG........c.... 22.50 243.00
The lowest wholesale quotation offered to New York
restaurants for this ‘Grand Cru’ St. Emilion is $300.00.
Here again, our early purchase brings economic advan-
tage to our clientele.

CHAI AY MARGARUA. 40. ae 29.50 318.60
The Chateau is classic and elegant and so is its wine.
CHATEAU LAFITE ROTHSCHILD....... 29.50 318.60

Lowest wholesale price in New York today—and that is
what stores and restaurants pay—is $400.00. Again, our
purchase of three years ago brings dividends to the
consumer.

CPT i OS, eens ay Seg 29.50 318.60
There are some who claim that Chateau Latour is the
best single wine produced in the Medoc during 1967.
CHATEAU MOUTON ROTHSCHILD..... 29.50 318.60
Frank Schoonmaker states this is the best of the ’67s.
A true long-lived glory.

CHATEAUCPETRUS 3.0. ae 39.50 426.60
In addition to intrinsic greatness, this is the scarcest of
the exalted wines of Bordeaux. Produces less than 20%
of a Lafite or a Mouton. Perhaps this accounts partially
for the high price.

1966 CHATEAU BOTTLED

A great, great claret year—a worthy successor to the classic
‘61s and an excellent precursor to the ’70s. In the grand tra-
dition—beautifully balanced—long-lived. Rapidly disappearing
off the market.

A Grand Cru St. Emilion vineyard that sold for $8.09
last month. Astonishing value at $5.49.
CHATEAU FOURCAS-HOSTEN ......... 5.99 64.70
If 1855 were reclassified today, this vineyard would be
among the first growths.
CHATEAU MARQUIS DE TERME....... 8.95 96.65
Among the 62 vineyards that were classified great in
1855. A superb 1966 Margaux.

CHATEAU DUCRU BEAUCAILLOU...... 16.50 178.20

A remarkable 1966 St. Julien that can challenge the
First Growths.

CHATEAU HAUT BRION. .... 3.5... 24.50 267.30
Only a strong inventory permits us to maintain this
$267.30 price. Now over $343.20 in Bordeaux. A truly
great wine with decades of development ahead.

CHATEAU LAFITE ROTHSCHILD....... 34.95 377.45
The current wholesale Bordeaux price is 2,040 francs the
case. Translated into current dollars at 20.5¢ the franc,
this is $418.20. Since the 1961 Lafite is now well over
$1,000 the case, we strongly suspect this 1966 will reach
equally astronomical figures in about five years. Now
is the time to acquire it.

CHATEAU: LATOUR <2 Se se 34.95 377.45
Rare, remarkable.
CHATEAU MOUTON ROTHSCHILD ....34.95 377.45
