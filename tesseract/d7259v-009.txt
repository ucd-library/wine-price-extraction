BEAUJOLAIS IN THE CLASSIC "POT" BOTTLE!

Here are the young, charming wines of the 1959 vintage that have been carefully selected,
after days of tasting, by Alexis Lichine, outstanding wine authority - the same 1959 Beaujolais
and Pouilly that have: captured the enthusiasm of wine drinkers throughout France, |

They have now arrived in the graceful "in-between" bottle which holds a generous 17 ounces -
not as large as the regular bottle, but almost 50% larger than the half bottle - an ideal size
when the half bottle is not quite enough. CHOOSE AMONG THEM - all at the same low price
of $1.59 each, $17.95 the case (if you wish, you can assort any 12 bottles listed here for

a total of $17.95).

* All descriptive comments about the wines were written at the vineyard by Alexis Lichine
without any change in text on our part.
