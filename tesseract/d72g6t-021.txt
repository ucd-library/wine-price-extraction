This fine dry example of Brut vintage Champagne deserves its reputation as New York’s best Champagne value.
Ideally suited for those who want to serve fine Champagne this Summer at low cost.

Wine lists in the better restaurants of France and England proudly offer Ayala 1959 as one of the best examples
of Champagne. In our opinion, not many Champagnes, regardless of price, surpass it in breed, dryness and flavor.
We can recommend it without reservation to the discriminating wine drinker.
105 POMMERY & GRENO CUVEE MONACO BRUT ............. 5.99 68.50
This special reserve from the famous Pommery & Greno cellars, gaily adorned with the flag of Monaco and a
cameo seal of Prince and Princess Rainier III, is especially imported by us, and would normally cost $8.00 a
bottle if brought in through regular commercial channels. Bone dry and beautifully balanced, it is a happy choice
for festive entertaining.

There has been an ever-increasing vogue for the pale dryness of Champagne made exclusively of white grapes.
Perfect for summer drinking.
2e = TAUREN PERRIER GRAND SIECLE 1999 . 25. 250 se ee. 12.40 133.92
Though not on sale, we do feel we should bring this remarkable wine to your attention. The production is small,
the bottle elegant and graceful, and the wine represents the best vinicultural efforts of the Champagne district.
For those who are seeking truly great Champagne—recommended unreservedly. Also available in Magnums
at $25.85 each.

From the vineyards in the foothills of the French Alps comes this remarkably clean, bone dry, sparkling wine.
Here is the sparkling wine that is ideally suited for the terrace or lawn party—a beautiful combination of high
quality and low sale cost.
97 ST. MICHEL BRUT (Finger Lakes, New York State) .......... 2.79 31.50
We honestly believe that St. Michel Brut, despite its low sale price, is quite the equal of any Champagne pro-
duced in the Finger Lakes district of New York State. Beautifully made, fully matured and delightful.
