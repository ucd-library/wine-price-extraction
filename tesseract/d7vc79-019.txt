961 CHATEAU BOTTLE

is e 4 4a LED

The vintage was 8oO good that even the humblest of growths made
first class wines. Since nearly everyone seemed to have made a good
61, it might make good economic sense to stay away from the First

Growths here. Possibly the greatest vintage of this generation.

No. Bottle Case

173 CHATEAU MEYNEY 3.79 10.95
A St. Estephe of distinction. Typical of the area, this one
has matured slowly and has just come into its own. Note
astonishing price.

164 CHATEAU LYNCH BAGES 9.75 105.30
Having just returned from Bordeaux, we are aware that ac-
quiring a ‘Lynch Bages’ 1961 is no mean accomplishment.

162 CHATEAU BEYCHEVELLE 10.95 118.25
A classic St. Julien of a classic year.

584 CARRUADES DE CHATEATI

LAFITE ROTHSCHILD 14.50 156.60
Makes a serious bid to being the best value in truly great
claret extant. Its heritage is the Lafite vineyard and its vin-
tage year is 1961. Big, glorious, ready now .

16] CHATEAU AUSONE 17.50 139.00
On the level of Cheval Blane and yet commands one third
the price of Cheval Blanc.

195 CHATEAU LATOUR 29.50 318.60
André Simon, prior to his recent death, was asked to pick
the wine that should be served to celebrate his 100th birth-
day seven years hence. He picked Chateau Latour 1961.

203 CHATEAU LAFITE ROTHSCHILD 19.75 540.00

A collector’s item. Great.

1959 CHATEAU BOTTLED

Though less concentrated than 1961, and hailed as the “Vintage of

the Century,” the °59s are nevertheless intrinsically great, despite

the dramatic publicity. All of these can be enjoyed today, with the

better ones endowed with at least two decades of vitality ahead.

175 CHATEAU BOUSCAUT 7.99 86.30
Of noble Graves heritage. Enjoy it now—or put it away for
a few years for added taste dividend.

182 CHATEAU LEOVILLE LASCASES 8.99 97.10

St. Julien and bottled by Nicolas. Finesse dominates.

133 CHATEAU LYNCH BAGES 10.95 118.25
Classic Pauillac Vineyard.
390 CHATEAU PALMER 13.50 145.80

The nobility of Margaux soil expressed during a great
vintage.

756 CHATEAU LATOUR 26.50 286.20
Very big and fat. Will live long.

423 CHATEAU LAFITE

ROTHSCHILD 59.50 695.00

Astonishing! Believe it or not, Lafite 1959 has become the
standard by which all other clarets are judged and threatens
to approach $1000 the case within the next two years.

19355 CHATEAU BOTTLED

Superb! With 14 years in bottle some of the wines are showing

maturation, depth and great balance.

1135 CHATEAU MONTROSE 9.75 105.30
The ‘big’ wines were most successful—and Montrose is ‘big.’

1181 CHATEAU COS D’ESTOURNEL 9.75 105.30
Rather similar to Montrose in its slow maturing
characteristics.

909 CHATEAU AUSONE 19.95 215.45
1955 in St. Emilion has become a classic. Here is Ausone
itself at a price that is remarkably low considering its
heritage.

1182 CHATEAU LATOUR 29.75 325.00
Share honors with Haut Brion as the best clarets produced
during 1955.

350 CHATEAU MOUTON

ROTHSCHILD 39.96 129.00

A classic—cost more in Bordeaux today.

329 CHATEAU LAFITE ROTHSCHILD.. 42.60 460.00

This wine masterpiece costs more than this in Bordeaux
today.

130 CHATEAU PETRUS 52.00 565.00
Will go down in wine literature as one of the immortals of

our generation.

During the early life of the ’52s, they contained an excess of tannin
which obscured the fruit. This has changed—they are now coming
into their own, can be enjoyed now with a long, long life a

826 CHATEAU DUHART MILON 6.99 75.90
Astonishingly low cost for this outstanding Pauillac—a vine-

character.

Brilliant future.

Chateau Margaux reached great heights in both 1952 and
1953 vintages.

392 CHATEAU HAUT BRION 26.50 286.20
Has been under wraps for a decade. Now beginning to show
its merits.

OLDER RED BORDEAUX

We have a few authentic survivors of previous decades which are

completely irreplaceable and available only in limited quantity.

213 CHATEAU TALBOT 1949 11.75 126.90
A ‘sleeper. A true and aged ‘great’ that is worth double the
price.

641 CHATEAU BOUSCAUT 1949
A classic Graves of great depth.

1031 CHATEAU CALON SEGUR 1949 13.50 145.80
The slow maturation of St. Estephe yields dividends here.

1160 CHATEAU HAUT BRION 1948 17.50 189.00

1948 was ignored early in its life because it was squeezed

13.50 145.80

between the great 1947 and 1949. It has now joined the ranks
of nobility because of intrinsic excellence.

1195 CHATEAU DESMIRAIL 1929 24.50 264.60
In 1929, this Margaux vineyard was called Desmirail. It was
subsequently absorbed by Chateau Palmer, its neighbor, and
the wine is no longer bottled under this label. Remarkable.

1168 CHATEAU PICHON

LALANDE 1926 24.75 267.30
A glorious Pauillac.

1157 CHATEAU CHEVAL BLANC 1949. 39.50 126.60

St. Emilions extant.

354 CHATEAU LATOUR 1947 12.75 161.70
Only three cases remain.

992 CHATEAU LATOUR 1926 15.00 525.00

If wine makes any bid towards immortality, we know of no
candidate that has a greater projection for future life than
Latour 1926.

369 CHATEAU LATOUR 1945 16.75 354.90
Many consider this the greatest Chateau Latour produced
during our lifetime.
