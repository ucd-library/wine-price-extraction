[here will be no parking problem for the
skier who decides to break his hunger at
the BRASSERIE~—at least as far as his skis
and poles are concerned. Our spies report
that this restaurant is installing a ski rack,
and we have even heard rumors that there
is a six-foot doorman who is able and will-
ing to help disentangle equipment from
Gan or taxi.

[he hungry sportsman need not feel self
conscious about either his clothes or his
appetite here. The waitresses, decked out
in native Alsatian dress, are more than
likely to bestow an extra smile on the
parka’d patron, and portions are such that
it takes a day’s skiing to do them full
justice.

Whatever hour of the day the skier decides
to trade in his ski poles for a knife and
fork, he will find appropriate fare being
served at the BRASSERIE. The restaurant,
which is located in the Seagram Building
(the entrance is at 100 East 53rd Street)
is open 24 hours a day, and many of the
dishes it serves seem to team naturally with
talk of conquering the pure christie, or de
scending a hill in 68 seconds.

   

Entering New York’s newly created after-
ski rendevous—the Brasserie.

For the skier who is more intrepid on the
slopes than at the table, there is such all
American fare as sirloin steak, scrambled
eggs and bacon and ice cream sodas. A
study of the menu, however, reveals that
there are also dishes reminiscent of Alsace,
the Alps and the Pyrenees. Here are some
examples:

From ALSACE-—tarte a l’oignon, quiche
lorraine, Muenster croute, choucroute Al
sacienne. From the ALPS—escargots bour
guignon, saucisson en croute. From the
PYRENEES—omelette piperade, pate de
foie gras, and hamburger Basquaise.

Cheese Fondue—can be fun at the Brasserie

EATING. DRINKING & SKIING
IN THE FRENCH ALPS

When driving from Paris to ski the Mont Blanc region, it is not much of a detour to go
through the wine growing areas of Burgundy, Beaujolais or Alsace. These wines are
available, and are consumed joyously, by the skiers of Chamonix, Courchevel, Megeve
and Val D’Isere. It is not unusual for the sportsmen of the Haut Savoie to turn each
evening from the stem-christie to the stemmed goblet.

We salute the skiers of France and the intrepid beginners of Van Cortlandt Park and the
near-by Sterling Forest ski centre (just past Tuxedo Park) with the wines of these French
districts at low bargain sale prices.
