OF POLICY

NOVEMBER 1964 brings a new challenge to the wine and liquor
merchants of New York State. Competition will be increasingly keen.
More than ever, a true professional attitude will be required. Simple
honesty, understanding of the true meaning of the word ‘‘value,”’ and
sensitivity to the customers’ needs must be the continuing cornerstone
of day-by-day policy.

Over 30 years have elapsed since we first opened our doors In
modest fashion. From the beginning, we have dedicated ourselves to
the policy of offering wines and spirits of indisputable origin and merit,
and at the lowest prices consistent with the quality of the product. The
wisdom of this long range policy has been confirmed, year after year,
by the gratifying growth in the number of satisfied clientele.

And now, faced with new demands during these present days
of fluidity and change, we shall continue our practice of avoiding
compromise, searching for the best within each class, and
conservatively clinging to the belief that our most valuable assets are
not ‘‘bottles on the shelf,’’ but a satisfied clientele —most of whom
are not just customers, but have become steadfast friends.

Professionalism has demanded that we check our sources and
quality. Much of our staff visit the vineyards and distilleries annually.
We have learned to know the men who make our wines and our spirits.
lt, We have thus eliminated doubtful sources — we are fully aware of the
coma integrity and skill and pride of those in Bordeaux, California, Burgundy,
a Kentucky, Scotland, and even New England who grow and produce
what we sell.

In light of this, and our belief in the future, we intend
maintaining our leadership as the ‘‘wine and spirits center of New
York’’ — whether it be today — during the Christmas season — next year
—or a decade hence.
