1980 VINTAGE

Wise wine-lovers have long been aware that so-called “off”
vintages provide excellent opportunities in high quality wines
at low prices. Robert Parker in Connoisseur magazine
comments: “The 1980, sandwiched between a succession of
top years in Bordeaux, has become a forgotten stepchild.
However, the shrewd and adventurous wine enthusiast knows
how surprisingly good the best wines from this vintage are....
The 1980 clarets are fully mature, with few exceptions, and
offer delicious drinking now.”

In summary, if you want to enjoy top-flight Bordeaux at
modest cost, do not overlook the 1980 vintage.

ILARETS — ’80 &°79 %

A great success throughout Bordeaux. From their infancy,
these wines displayed impressive color, balance and concentra-
tion. The best of them—those we have selected here—
continue to flourish in the bottle. Act quickly—1979s are
rapidly disappearing from the marketplace.
