3302 BACK BAY GIN (S.S. Pierce: Co.). . . . See.) 6a

We first introduced “Back Bay Gin” to the New York public about five years ago. We happily report that we have rarely
experienced such complete and enthusiastic acceptance. We believe it is well deserved—this 90 proof Gin is clean, bone
dry, and ideally suited to fullfill its function as the basic ingredient of the distinctive Martini. Made by the venerable
New England firm of S. S. Pierce Co., “Back Bay Gin” is in the best American tradition. For added savings, we suggest
FULL QUARTS at $4.55 each, $52.40 the case.

3303 FORTNUM & MASON’S IMPORTED GIN (England. . . . . 4.99 58.50

Here is a superb example of really fine English Gin. And it has proven its worth among discriminating drinkers in
London. Certainly, there is no finer Gin made anywhere. An amazing price for a Gin of this calibre. Comparable to

Gins selling at $5.90.

3401 BACK BAY VODKA (80 proof—S. $. Pierce Co.). . . . . . 3.69 42.75

An exceptionally fine Vodka from one of America’s finest and oldest firms—S. S. PIERCE CO.—established in Boston
back in 1831. Improve your Vodka drinks and save. For added economy, we suggest FULL QUARTS at $4.55 the quart;

$52.40 the case.

3407 FREDERICK CHOPIN VODKA (100 proof—Poland). . . . . 4.99 58.50

Polish Vodka of this proof and pedigree normally commands over $6.00 the bottle. Believe it or not, we are actually
offering this imported Vodka at a lower price than you pay for its domestic equivalent. A unique opportunity to add

quality and interest to your Vodka drinks and yet save.
