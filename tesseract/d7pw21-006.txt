1936 DOWLING 11 YEAR OLD BONDED KENTUCKY 8.95 103.00

A rare 11 Year Old! Bourbon of this age and pedigree usually commands over $10! The number of
barrels of 11 Year Old whiskey in existence is limited because of the serious loss through evaporation—
usually almost 50%—during the 11 years. However, the reward for patience is a whiskey reminiscent
of the great pre-Prohibition Bourbons—rich in flavor, delicacy, bouquet and soft mellowness.

There is probably no better expression of the American Distiller’s art presently available, barring a
few collectors’ items, than this extraordinary DOWLING made in the best American tradition at a
small country distillery in Kentucky. We offer this, after much comparative tasting, to those seeking

the finest Bourbon obtainable today.
