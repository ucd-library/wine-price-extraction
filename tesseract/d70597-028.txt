RHONE VALLEY

The Rhone river starts in Switzerland and empties into the
Mediterranean. Red and white wines flourish along its entire
length. The important wine section is south of Lyon and in-
cludes all of the world-famed names listed below.

RED RHONE WINES

No. Bottle Case
663 COTES DU RHONE ROUGE 1970 ........ 1.79 19.95

The CRAIG CLAIBORNE JOURNAL reports in its April issue,
“We found a red wine that is honest and dry and clean to the
palate. It is a 1970 from the Rhone Valley, bottled at the vine-
yard called La Vieille Ferme—it is excellent and the equal, we
feel, of the much better known and neighboring Chateauneuf-
du-Pape, which it resembles. We predict that if the wine is
properly stored, it will have softer qualities within a year or
two.”

Incidently, for those who would want further information about
subscribing to the ‘Craig Claiborne Journal,’ it is suggested that
you write Craig Claiborne, P.O. Box EEAA, Easthampton, N.Y.
11937.

SPECIAL OFFERING-—Five (5) cases, totalling 60 bottles for
only $90.00—do you know of a more economic way of getting a
full seasons supply of top flight red wine?

587 CROZES HERMITAGE 1967... .. 2.59 27.95
From the vineyards surrounding Hermitage overlooking
the Rhone Valley. Similar in characteristics to Hermitage
itself, but with a little less depth, maturing more quickly
—however, it is considerably less expensive. Estate-
bottled, Fayolle.

585 GIGONDAS 1970... :.... 2... .3.:) 2.59 27.95
Gigondas is a superior example of red Rhone wine—the
very wine featured at the Hostelerie de Beaumaniere at
Les Baux. Estate-bottled, Caves St. Pierre.

538: GORNAS 1969 ...:..: 2.3)... 3.29 35.55
Nestling in the hills, near the Rhone Valley, just south of
Lyon, is the Corras vineyard—a most satisfying example
of red wine. Estate-bottled, Clape.

615 ST, JOSEPH 1963.......... 3.39 36.60
One bank of the Rhone River produces Hermitage—the
opposite bank produces St. Joseph. The grape varieties
and taste qualities are similar, although the Hermitage
generally reaches more exalted heights. Estate-bottled,
Florentin.

577. CGHATEAUNEUF DU PAPE 1987.......... 3.79 40.95
There is an eagle’s nest vineyard towering over the town
of Chateauneuf-du-Pape which is called Domaine de
Beaucastel. It is at this vineyard that this glorious ex-
ample of an outstandingly fine red Rhone Valley wine is
estate-bottled. It is now in balance, with five years of
aging, and you will be delighted with it.

559 ©6COTE ROTIE 1967... ..- 3... 4.95 53.45
Produced at a celebrated vineyard only a five minute
drive south of the famed Pyramide Restaurant in Vienne.
The incredibly steep vineyard faces due south, held up
by sturdy retaining walls, and everything must be culti-
vated by hand. Deep in color, full bodied, amazingly long
life, and everyone looks for the aroma of violets when
they drink ‘Cote Rotie.’ Estate-bottled, Gerin.

THE RHONE VALLEY RED WINE SAMPLER- one each

of the seven (7) Rhone red wines shown above—(regularly
$22.99}-only 05.5 cc $20.95

 

WHITE RHONE WINES

535 CHATEAUNEUF DU PAPE BLANC 1969 .. 2.99 32.30
A rarity—not easy to come by—dry. Estate-bottled, Do-
maine de Beaucastel.

374 HERMITAGE BLANC 1970 ........-----: 4.85 52.50
Estate-bottled, Chante Alouette. Great character, among
the longest lasting of all dry white wines.

693 GONDRIEU 1970... 2 6.95 75.05
Condrieu is located about three miles south of Cote Rotie
on the Rhone. The wine is dry with a unique flowery
scent and an almost “spicy” aftertaste. A wine of great
breed and unusual character which is best in its youth.
One of our favorites. Estate-bottled, Vernay.

539. CHATEAU GRILLET 1970... ,.16.50 178.20

The rarest wine in all of France. Only 185 cases produced

annually. First importation into America—highly ra-

tioned, dry, unique.
