   

During late January, MICHAEL and SAM AARON
embarked on an intensive tour through the
vineyards of Napa_and Sonoma in search of
the best wine nuggets produced in that

blessed soil. Accompanying them was BURGESS
MEREDITH - distinguished actor, producer,
director, and also one of America's leading

 

wine connoisseurs.

These nuggets are not easy to come by. Since
many of them are rationed in California, much
friendly persuasion was required to have the
growers ship their best bottles to New York.
We succeeded! We know of few California wine
merchants who provide a choicer galaxy of

Am

ierica's best red and white

 

 

wines.

mana valley,

Napa Valley is to California what the Medoc is to Bordeaux - the heart, the
most historic and perhaps the most important wine-growing area of the state -
although Sonoma Valley now vies for the crown. It is for this reason that
Burgess Meredith and the Aarons instinctively settled at the Silverado Inn

in the hub of Napa, as their base for the exploration of the many vineyards
of northern California.
