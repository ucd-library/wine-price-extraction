RARE OLD WINES
FROM A “FORGOTTEN
BURGUNDY CELLAR’

During our recent trip to the vineyards, Rovsticls of Cok
M. Doudet-Naudin showed us his con- Placed in Each Bottle
cealed cistern which had been sealed up ict p ee
and ‘forgotten’ from 1942 until the sum- '

mer of 1955. The sight was impressive and unforgettable.

Back in 1942, with the German invasion imminent, M.
Doudet-Naudin, like many another Frenchman, simply sealed
up the cream of his great Burgundies. The wines had been
away from all light, air and vibration for 13 years. The wall
was broken down last year in the presence of the French tax
authorities. As far as we know, this is the only important
collection of rare old vintages that still exists anywhere in
Burgundy.

We were skeptical, tasted the wines, and found them vigorous,
of exceptional breed, and still in their prime. To insure its

quality, the cork of each bottle was drawn, the wine carefully
tasted, and a branded cork put into each bottle.

Here. are authentic estate bottlings,’ aged under the most
ideal conditions and critically re-examined and re-corked be-
fore leaving the vineyard.

THERE WILL BE NO OPPORTUNITY TO ACQUIRE
WINES OF THIS AGE AND PEDIGREE AGAIN.
