For more than a decade, during our annual trips to the vine-
yards, we have always been on the lookout for fine old
Clarets that have been stored under ideal conditions and have
stood the test of time. Most of these wines are from the
extraordinary cellars of Alexis Lichine in Margaux, the
remainder from the private cellar of Daniel Guestier in Bor-
deaux. In several instances, the quantity that reached us of a

single item is under one case.

Each has been carefully tasted before shipment by the proud
owners who parted with these old friends only after much
friendly persuasion. Served with loving care, these wines will
provide an extraordinary tasting experience to those fond of

fine old Clarets.

All of the great post-war Clarets also form part of our cellars. Included
are such world renowned Chateaux as Ausone, Cheval Blanc, Haut Brion,
Lafite-Rothschild, Latour, Margaux and Mouton Rothschild. Most of
these are available at the lowest quotations, in the great vintage years
of '53, 52, '49 and ’47. They will be joined later this winter by the highly
regarded 1955 which is about to be bottled in Bordeaux.
