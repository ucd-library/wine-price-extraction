CLIFTON FADIMAN comments on the recent
wine article written by our associate, Sam
Aaron, for House Beautiful.

“Mr. Aaron is now the Wine Columnist for
HOUSE BEAUTIFUL, a circumstance
tending to make more possible the Life
Satisfying. His article, here reprinted from
that excellent publication, not only sup-
plies positive information of rare utility,
but is a splendid example of salutary de-
structiveness. His five “Rules to Ignore”
go to the heart of the matter. Those of us
who have been bewildered by the abraca-
dabra of temperature, aging, decanting,
vintage years and wine-glasses need no
longer remain in a state of befuddled in-
timidation. Not that Mr. Aaron isa hearty,
back-slapping, common man of Wine. He
is an expert. He knows all about the rituals,
nuances, the minutiae of the art of wine-
drinking. But he has reduced them to com-
mon sense. He not only tells us precisely
how to go about building a “library” of
wine for non-astronomical sums of money,
but how to get the most enjoyment out of
our collection, minus fuss, anxiety and
timewasting.”’

470 YOUR CHOICE—VINHO VERD
RED OR WHITE. <1. 2. 1.49 16.50

Here is the best table wine of Portugal. Make no mistake about it, these wines are truly delightful. Normally
S179:

899 YOUR CHOICE—CASSIS BLANC
OR ROSE (Imbert) . 1.49 16.50

The knowledgeable citizens of Marseilles are proud of the dry white and rose wines produced in the nearby
seaside town of Cassis. It would be hard to buy either of these more cheaply on the Cote d’Azur.

416 ANJOU BLANC, 1961 (Clos du Moulin) 1.69

A Loire wine that was a favorite of Brillat-Savarin. Pale, dry, adequate fruit. Regularly $1.79.

793 BERNCASTELER SCHWANEN, 1960 (Dunweg) 1.69 18.75

Perhaps the most sought-after Moselles are those produced on the good vineyard land surrounding the pictur-
esque town of Berncastel. This 1960 is dry, somewhat austere and a true connoisseur’s wine. Normally $1.99.

667 SANCERRE, 1960 (R. Laporte) . 1.99 20.95

“Are you Sancerre?” can well be asked of the wines of this Loire district. There are many dubious bottles
bearing this proud name. Here is an authentic estate bottling with all the finesse associated with true Sancerre,
now the most popular white wine of Paris. Regularly $2.49.

18.75

97 ST. MICHEL BRUT CHAMPAGNE (N.Y. State) 2.79 31.50

Some of America’s best champagne is produced in the Finger Lakes district of New York State. They normally
command about $4.25 the bottle. This one, naturally fermented in the bottle, is surely the equal of any of them.
A sensational bargain.

155 AYALA BRUT 1959 CHAMPAGNE 4.99 56.50

We have eagerly awaited, with much anticipation, our first shipment of the 1959 vintage from this world-famous
Champagne house. It has just arrived—and it is completely up to our expectations. This is, perhaps, the best
value in great Champagne that we have experienced in a decade.

2885 SAMUEL JOHNSON
“COFFEE HOUSE” COGNAC 5.99 68.50

Candidly, we have reduced the price of this superb Cognac for one simple reason—we want more people to
become acquainted with its virtues. It comes from the best soil of Cognac, and is thus entitled to the label

“Grande Fine Champagne.” It has rested long in cask and surpasses most brandies that command over $8
the bottle.

2850 SINGLE CASK UNBLENDED COGNAC
(1934 Vintage)

Here is an authentic estate-bottled Cognac that was produced during a great vintage year. In our opinion, it is
not surpassed by any other Cognac, regardless of price. Regularly $9.98.

8.99 105.00

2108 EAU-DE-VIE-DE-POIRE WILLIAMS . 10.95

A small island in the Rhone River, not far from Avignon, is the home of M. Manguin, who grows the wonderful
Williams pear for sale to the great restaurants of France. When his pears are bruised, he distills them into
fabulous brandy—the same pear brandy that is featured by Dumaine, Chez Pointe and Le Grand Vefour. This
brandy has just arrived—there are only 10 cases. Regularly $11.95.
