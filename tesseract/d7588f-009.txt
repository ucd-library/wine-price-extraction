HOLDS DOLFI
FRAMBERRY

A SUPERB RASPBERRY LIQUEUR

MADE IN ALSACE

IMPORTED BY BELLOWS & CO.

A delightful gift item that usual-
ly sells for 50% higher — the
KIOSK contains a large 25 oz.
bottle of one of the most pleas-
ing liqueurs of all France —
Dolfi Framberry, the much
sought after Raspberry liqueur
of Alsace.

This charming replica of the be-
loved Parisian Kiosk carries on
its outside in full, vivid color,
many of the popular street post-
ers of Paris. And when the Kiosk
is open, the recipient will be de-
lighted with the contents — the
delicious Raspberry liqueur of
Alsace.

At Christmas, even when it sold
at $9.49, it has been one of our
popular gift items — at the dra-
matically low sale offering of
$5.99, it is certainly a holiday
opportunity that should not be
overlooked.

Imported by Bellows & Co.
to sell for $9.49

DAWSON

Gift ‘’75’’. PARK & TILFORD PRIVATE
STOCK features, at no extra cost, a
new personalized book shaped gift
decanter with three sided label simu-

lating brown leather binding.
Complete 5.25

Not only is Peter Dawson Rare Reserve
Scotch a treasure in itself (the average
age of the whiskey in this bottle is well
over twenty years), but it becomes doubly
precious in this magnificent hand-cut lead
crystal decanter. The decanter, made by
Royal Brierley, is a superb example of
British glassware artistry.

Because of the hand skill required to make
these decanters, only a small quantity is
available, each bottle bearing its own indi-
vidual number. If you are seeking a unique
one bottle Christmas gift, we suggest that
you order now to avoid disappointment due

to depletion.
