The honest, unstretched Beaujolais of 1962, from good vineyard soil, and Estate-bottled, are typical and very pleasant.
They have improved beyond original expectations and are, today, ready for drinking—young and fresh. Since the 1963
vintage is poor, outside a few exceptions, 1962 is likely to be the best Beaujolais values for the next year or two, what
with the prices constantly marching up in France because of depletion, and a generally disappointing 1963.

We offer here two of the best Beaujolais of France in the regular 24-o0z. bottle and in the graceful, ‘in-between’ bottle—
fondly called a “Pot”, which holds a generous 17 oz.—not as large as a regular bottle, but almost 50% larger than the
half bottle. If it is dinner for two, we suggest the “Pot”—if more than two, the bottle size. And for those who drink
their Beaujolais more sparingly, there are also half bottles.

Estate bottled, Mousset From the very center, the best vineyard land of Beaujolais. Excellent balance, and
its fruit and freshness will delight for at least another two years.

One of the best years in this century—in St. Emilion and Pomerol, it was astonishingly great—and in the Medoc, they
have not experienced such remarkable wines since 1945. However, these comments, true in almost every instance
as far as the great Chateau bottlings are concerned, are not of equal significance when applied to regional wines.

In the instance of regionals, the quality is more dependent on the quality of the wine that the shipper chooses, and
the skill he employs in blending them. If the base has a high proportion of really fine 1961, whether it be Medoc,
Bordeaux Rouge or St. Emilion, we are contending with a superior regional wine. We were careful here—these
regionals of FRESNAY FRERES have gone through several comparative tastings against wines supplied by other
shippers. The wines of Fresnay weathered the storm beautifully, they achieved high ratings, and we can state un-
hesitatingly that at these prices, we suspect that this is the best buy that can be acquired anywhere in New York by the
