From

19th Century MADEIRAS

Here is an epoch-making offer of the most remarkable
collection of authentic 19th Century Madeiras ever seen
in either Continental Europe or the United States. Each

of these wines is made exclusively from wine grapes of

the year indicated on the label. The front label, individ-
ually numbered, states the total number of bottles in
existence, while the back label, which gives a personal
history of the wine, is hand signed by a Director of the
impeccable firm of Blandy, certifying that the bottle
contains a genuine Madeira of the vintage stated.

The total number of bottles in existence is small indeed,
and when these are gone, the opportunity to taste au-
thentic 19th Century Vintage Madeira of this calibre
will be lost forever.
