BEST AND MOST
ENJOYABLE OF
OUR LIFETIME!!

The 1964 Red Burgundies, among the best and most enjoyable
of our time, have been resting in our cellars for about three years.
It is now quite clear that sufficient bottle age has been acquired so
that even a modestly qualified wine-lover can recognize its virtues.

A 1964 Red Burgundy, if its origin is of undisputable character,
is identified by richness in fruit, beautiful balance, a sufficient amount
of depth, and the obvious earmarks of staying power indicated by the
presence of tannin. The most practical kind of red wine—the kind
you can drink today or lay away for the future—whatever you do
there is no likelihood of your making a mistake.

BOURGOGNE ROUGE, Nicolas .

What this country needs is not ‘‘a good five-cent cigar’, but a good bottle of
Burgundy at $2.00. Here it is. You can drink it day-in and day-out, not worry
too much about the expense, and you would be drinking typical wine of the
Cote d'Or.

PINOT NOIR DE MARSANNAY,

eg ree ee

Made of the noble Pinot Noir grape that has flourished in some of the best soil
of Burgundy, not too far south from Dijon.

COTE DE BEAUNE VILLAGES,

se ee ge

The appellation ‘“‘Cote de Beaune Villages’? means that it is wine of the Cote de
Beaune from a township other than Beaune itself. Here is an excellent Burgundy
of the middle group that gives you good wine at modest cost.

MONTHELIE, Potinet-Ampeau..

Tiny village back of Volnay; among the best of the lesser-known Burgundies.

BEAUNE CENT VIGNES, Duchet

The better vintages of Beaune are characterized by softness and are notable for
finesse and aroma. They are relatively quick to mature. Here is a true glory
produced in the happy vintage year of 1964.

CHAMBOLLE MUSIGNY,

CE es

Celebrated wine-producing township. Here is a superb example, nourished with
loving care by the Mayor of the town, Alain Roumier.

POMMARD, de Courcel. . . .

Much of the wine that bears the easy-to-remember name of Pommard must be
delicious, since ten times as much is sold around the world than is produced. We
are dealing here with a genuine, estate-bottled example of great class and the
well-balanced qualities associated with superb Pommard.

CHAMBOLLE MUSIGNY, LES
CHARMES, Cambola. =. . «+

From one of the best vineyards of the famed township—Les Charmes. A true
thoroughbred. Alain Roumier, the grower, is deservedly proud of it.

CHAPELLE CHAMBERTIN,
Meee ae se

In a blind tasting, we put this remarkable wine up against several Chambertins,
and none of the competition surpassed it. A true jewel in the Burgundian crown,

priced at half its true value.

 

VOLNAY CLOS DES DUCS,

COMIN 6k 6 ae ee,
Best vineyard of Volnay. Quality extremely high—great longevity.

CHAMBERTIN, Poupon. . . .

52 ac f . ;
a of some of the most remarkable vineyard land in all of Burgundy.

GRANDS ECHEZEAUX,
Romanee Conti. . .  . ;

From the remarkable cellars of the D i i
L omaine de la i
sents the last eight cases left in America. <n ried

LA TACHE, Domaine de la

nominee Cast | os a

Only 15 precious acres! Many consider this the greatest single red wine produced
in France, and we are the last to argue the point. Very rare, irreplaceable. Buy

now—or “forever hold your peace’, for soon ’64 La Tache will be but a fond
memory.

MUSIGNY, Comte de Vogue . .

Made from the original pre-phylloxera vines. Total production 180 cases. Some
consider it the greatest single Burgundy of all France.

THE
SCOTCH
THAT
REACHES
EXALTED
HEIGHTS
IN
EXCELLENCE

 

SOMETHING SPECIAL

Periodically, the directors of the Hill-
Thomson Distillery run across a mature cask
of Scotch Whisky that towers above the
others in smoothness, flavor and roundness.
When this happens, they bottle it under the
name of SOMETHING SPECIAL. The
price should be much above other premium
Scotches — in truth, at our SALE PRICE,
it will cost you hardly more than what you
are presently paying for the ‘garden variety.’
