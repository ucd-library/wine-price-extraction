CHATEAU FIGEAC 1953 (St. Emilion)

delicate, dry white wine of Pouilly-sur-Loire. Here is a
superb example at a most attractive price.

this venerable English firm.

FORTNUM’S RED SEAL SCOTCH .....

A Scotch Whisky of exceptional balance and richness of
flavor. Shipped to the United States only in the most
limited quantities. Easily surpasses in quality many Scotch
Whiskies selling at considerably higher levels

FORTNUM’S IMPORTED GIN ...........
An exceptionally fine dry Gin made in the best British 1 man-
ner. Note how relatively inexpensive is this fine imported gin
of Fortnum & Mason.

FORTNUM’S COGNAC .............
A unique example of the delicacy, dryness and bouquet that
can be achieved by a true English Market Cognac.

FORTNUWM’S FINO SHERRY o.oo.
The traditional aperitif wine of England is a true Fino
Sherry. Here is a most unusual example — fine, bone dry.

FORTNUM’S AMONTILLADO SHERRY ...
A rich, fine Amontillado can only be achieved through
careful selection of the basic wines that makes up the
Sherry blend, plus long, careful aging.

FORTNUM’S SUPREME TAWNY PORT

This fine old English Market Tawny Port is a product of
generations of tasting. Very old, full flavored, dry finish.

FORTNUM’S RAINWATER MADEIRA .............

Rainwater Madeira is the lightest and dryest and therefore
is ideally suited as a before dinner aperitif. Served slightly
chilled, it is most excellent during summer days.

FORTNUM’S 1949 BRUT CHAMPAGNE
“English Market’, when applied to Champagne is not an
idle term, but is descriptive of a light, clean, bone dry wine
produced in the Champagne district with the least possible
amount of sugar dosage added.
