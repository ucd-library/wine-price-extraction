" states Gerald Asher, wine editor of Gourmet Magazine.

friends,

Sam Aaron, internationally-recognized wine authority, states,
"The NEW YORK TIMES BOOK OF WINE is an encyclopedic
classic that is indispensible for those who want to know about
the vineyards of the world, how to serve wine, its storage,
ageing - in short, everything anyone would want to know about
the subject of wine. In effect, it occupies the same exalted
position in the world of wine that Craig Claiborne's NEW YORK
TIMES COOK BOOK occupies in the world of food."

VOSNE-ROMANEE 1971, Moillard 8.27 105.30

Burgundians consider the commune wines of Vosne-Romanee the best
and most reliable of the village wines. Here we are dealing with
blends from the excellent vineyards that lie within the geographic
boundaries of Vosne-Romanee. Moillard, an acknowledged dean
among the wine merchants, exhibits his wine-making skill beautifully

VOSNE-ROMANEE, LES BEAUMONTS 1972, G. Noellat 9.49 108.00

Vosne-Romanee is undoubtedly the most prestigious wine-producing
commune of all France. In its boundaries you can find Romanee-

Conti, Richebourg, La Tache, and the outstanding Les Beaumonts
vineyard. All of these have common characteristics: amazing breed

and elegance, wonderful harmony, dramatic bouquet, and true nobility.
Also available in half-bottles at $4.89 each, $111.00 the case.
CHAMBERTIN CLOS DE BEZE 1972, B. Grivelet D7 113.45
oe Chambertin Clos de Beze is on the same

exalted level as Chambertin - it is

entitled to drop the 'Clos de Beze', if it

so chooses. It achieves the highest peak

of great red Burgundy - powerful, long-

lived, with great depth and breed. The

favorite of Napoleon, it was Dumas who

a eicio’ | said of it, "nothing makes the future look

so rosy as to contemplate it through a glass of Chambertin."

MUSIGNY 1972, Hudelot

We quote Frank Schoonmaker's Encyclopedia, "Musigny is unsurpassed
by any other red wine of the Cote d'Or or indeed of the world." About
1600 cases are produced a year and the world clamors for them. Only

a few cases of the 1972 remain.

MUSIGNY 1971, Comte de Vogue 35.79 386.53
There are those wine authorities who claim Musigny is the greatest of

the Burgundian vineyards, Comte de Vogue is the best producer on

the Cote d'Or, and 1971 is the best red Burgundy vintage year since

1961. If this be so - and we are not inclined fo argue here - we are

dealing with the greatest single gem available in Burgundy today.

It will continue to grow in greatness and stature with the passage

of years. Only ten cases - and then no more.

WINES OF THE DOMAINE DE LA ROMANEE- CONTI

Two words characterize the wines of the
DOMAINE DE LA ROMANEE-CONTI:
magnificent and scarce. For generations
these miraculous wines have represented
the summit of Red Burgundy. The entire
world competes for the prized bottles
produced annually by the few acres of
Domaine vineyard.

PINOT CHARDONNAY 1974, Meras 2.49
Here is the classic grape of Burgundy that finds good expression
in Macon as well as in northern California. Well balanced,
sprightly. Extraordinary value.
MACON LUGNY, BLANC DE BLANCS 1974 Leahy
Won Gold Award for excellence within its category. Dry, ideal
as a before-dinner aperitif. From vigneron's co-operative.
PINOT CHARDONNAY, LES CHARMES 1975 Zier,
fc onienOny Gold medals are not awarded lightly
MACON-LUGNY at the annual Paris Wine Fair. This
ve wine, which adorns the cover of the
, recently released "Craig Claiborne's
S Zp, Favorites, Volume II", achieves this
pee high honor for its clean dryness, grace
and distinguished bouquet. Featured
at the better French restaurants of New York. Note low price.
ST. VERAN 1974 Leo)
A new classification created because of excellence. Adjacent to
Pouilly-Fuisse. Dry, clean, fresh.
SAINT ROMAIN 1973 299,

POUILLY-VINZELLES 1974 Pag
Still another neighbor of Pouilly-Fuisse. Unfortunately, due to world
demand, the price of Pouilly-Fuisse has skyrocketed. Try this Pouilly
Vinzelles and drink equal quality at much lower cost.
BEAUJOLAIS BLANC 1975, Chateau de Chaintre See
99% of the wines grown in Beaujolais are red. Once in a while, we
run across a good example of a dry white grown in the area, produced
from the noble Pinot Chardonnay grape. Here is an outstanding one.
CHABLIS 1974, Vocoret 4.49
Robert Vocoret was a long-time mayor of the town of Chablis. He
has won many plaudits for the excellence of the dry white wine he
produces on the hillsides and this is a superb example.
CUVEE LATOUR BLANC 1973, Louis Latour 4.79

Here we must pause. This superb, rich, full white Burgundy can match
the best Meursault you have ever tasted. It is possibly the best value
in outstanding white Burgundy offered in a decade. It is not a simple
Pinot Chardonnay, Macon Blanc or Bourgogne Blanc, but it is produced
from the soil of the Cote de Beaune. It is Cuvee Latour 1973 proudly
produced by Louis Latour himself. He thinks enough of it to emblazon
his name on the label. In blind tastings it is the match of many white
Burgundies that we and many others are offering for over $8 the bottle.

Only a few cases remain. Next shipment arrives early April. Anticipate
your spring and summer requirements now !
POUILLY FUISSE 1975, Georges Burrier 4.99
It was in 1956, with Frank Schoonmaker

as mentor, that I first visited Georges

Burrier. It was my first contact with an
outstanding estate-bottled Pouilly Fuisse

which is often head and shoulders above

the run-of-the-mill, commercial examples

that are encountered in every large city of

the western world. Here is Pouilly Fuisse

* : at its best - a worthy rival to a good Chablis,
Meursault, or Chassagne Montrachet. Only
200 cases - and then no more.

PULIGNY-MONTRACHET 1973 ie
We are now entering a most exalted world of the vineyards surrounding
Montrachet. Here is a thoroughbred from the cellars of the world-famed

Bernard Grivelet.

CHABLIS GRAND CRU, LES PREUSES 1974 De ae
Here is Chablis at its best. Rich, full, vigorous - yet endowed with
balance and delicacy. Selected by Alexis Lichine.

MEURSAULT, CASSE-TETE 1973 6.45
Not just plain Meursault - but from one of its best vineyards.
Estate-bottled by Roland Thevenin.

| MEURSAULT 1974 6.49

| Matrot is to Meursault what Comte de

| Vogue is to Musigny, and what Marquis

de Laguiche is to Montrachet - the best

of class. It is superb - we repeat, superb.
Rarely have we tasted a Meursault with

| such charm, perfect balance and finesse.

In the same exalted league as Montrachet

majestic beauty.
