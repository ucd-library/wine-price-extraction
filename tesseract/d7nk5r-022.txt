WINES OF SPAIN—RED, WHITE, ROSE

Wine history is being made here. Mid-June will mark the first
arrival from the Catalonia area of northeast Spain of excellent,
young, and fresh table wine identified by the grape variety only,
rather than by exalted expressions implying age and majesty.
You will find the pink wine, Gamay Rose 1967, a delight in the
summer; the white wine, Pinot Chardonnay 1966, truly dry,
fresh and with character; and the Cabernet Sauvignon 1966,
made from the classic grape of Bordeaux, an ideal wine for
drinking day in and day out. And happily we report, that all of
them are on sale at only $1.49 each, $16.10 the case. (Mix them,
if you wish, and still enjoy the case price.)
