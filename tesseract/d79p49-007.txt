COL COURBE V.S.E.P. (Crooked Neck) 5.49
Col Courbe, in its interesting crooked neck bottle, is
an honest, well-made Cognac that will meet every
standard required by those who are accustomed to
paying $8.00 for Cognac. A fine Brandy at modest
cost.

SAMUEL JOHNSON (Coffee House) COGNAC 6.77

It is entirely appropriate for this excellent "Grande Fine Champagne
Cognac" to be named in Dr. Samuel Johnson's honor since he is the one
who said, "Claret is the drink for boys; port is the drink for men; but he
who aspires to be a Hero must drink Brandy!" Here is a spirit that is
part of the past that we can share with so many great men, from Johnsor
to Napoleon ...

SINGLE CASK UNBLENDED (1929 Vintage) 9.98
Here is an estate bottled Cognac that was produced during a great vintage
year (1929) in the most celebrated part of the Cognac Country, "Grande
Fine Champagne". Cognac of this calibre is difficult to obtain because
no more than a few small growers have the patience and aptitude to put
aside, year after year, a distillation of their outstanding vintages.

BRIAND GRANDE FINE CHAMPAGNE COGNAC 15.70
Justly regarded by most experts as the greatest Cognac of France.
Distilled in 1906 by the late Gaston Briand. His widow will continue
to supply this until her very limited reserves are gone. Regularly $17.50.

 

MARCEL BRUT 1955
Marcel! 1955 offers a most unusual opportunity to acquire a fine Brut
Champagne at exceptionally low cost. Half bottles at $2.59 each,
$54.75 the case.

AYALA GOLD LABEL BRUT 1955 4.99
Wine lists in the better restaurants of France and England proudly offer
Ayala 1955 as one of the best examples of Champagne. In our opinion,
not many Champagnes, regardless of price, surpass it in breed, dryness
and flavor. We can recommend it without reservation to the discriminating
wine drinker.

POMMERY: & GRENO CUVEE MONACO BRUT neve
This special reserve from the famous Pommery & Greno cellars, gaily
adorned with the flag of Monaco and a cameo seal of Prince and
Princess Rainier Hl, is specially imported by us, and would normally
cost $8.00 a bottle if brought in through regular. commercial channels.
Bone dry and beautifully balanced, it is a happy choice for festive
entertaining.
