We quote The Wine Spectator: “If 1984 is an off vintage in
Burgundy, you would never know it from tasting the 1984
Domaine de la Romanee-Conti reds. The wines are beautifully
proportioned, rich and concentrated.

“Among the wines that rose to the top is Romanee-St.-
Vivant which is a textbook example of its appellation .... We
liked the relatively undervalued Echezeaux because of its
distinctive and delicious flavors.”

We quote Robert Parker, from an article about Burgundy
wines in Food & Wine Magazine: “... the successes of the
[1983] vintage will render the finest red Burgundies since 1969
or 1964. The great wines of the vintage have more body, more
depth and dimension than the best red Burgundies of 1978.”

most outstanding examples of the vintage—at low prices
