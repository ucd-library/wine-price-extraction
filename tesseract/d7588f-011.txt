Inspired by the old-fashioned
swinging lantern of the 19th cen-
tury, the 115 year old firm of Park
& Tilford has conceived this mus-
ical decanter that holds the fine old
American blended whiskey that
bears the name MR. TILFORD.,
an original founder of the firm.

The lantern, in gleaming copper,
has a concealed miniature music
box that plays an old time melody
— a tune that will add warmth on
Christmas Day.
