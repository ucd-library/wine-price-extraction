1972 RED BURGUNDY

GIVRY, Desvignes
Charming, fragrant, though little known. Ready now.

ALOXE CORTON, Bize
From one of the oldest wine-growing villages on the Céte de
Beaune. Full, fairly big, firm.

CHASSAGNE MONTRACHET, CLOS ST. JEAN, Ramonet
Some Burgundy communes are lucky enough to grow both red
and white wines of distinction. Chassagne is one, and Claude
Ramonet's Clos St. Jean Rouge is a delight.

CORTON RENARDES, Delarche

Far from maturity. A great wine to keep for a few more years.

CHAMBOLLE MUSIGNY, Hudelot

‘Feminine’, elegant, relatively light. Especially nice.

NUITS ST. GEORGES, LES BOUDOTS, Noellat
Les Boudots has long been acknowledged as one of the best
vineyards in Nuits St. Georges.

ECHEZEAUX, Gouroux
A very attractive low price for one of the thirty-one Grand
Crus of Burgundy.

CHARMES CHAMBERTIN, Humbert
Neither big nor weighty, rather refined and complex. Possessed

of much of the greatness of Chambertin itself. Very good value.

CHAPELLE CHAMBERTIN, Trapet
One of the most delicate wines of the C6te de Nuits. Much
finesse. From the fine grower Louis Trapet.

1971 RED BURGUNDY

POMMARD, CHATEAU DE POMMARD,
Laplanche

Full-bodied, earthy. Ready now.
Beautiful antique-style bottle enhances
the drama of this wine. Remarkable value
for red Burgundy of this class.

 

MUSIGNY, Comte de Vogué
Exceedingly rare and refined. From the great 1971 vintage.
One of the greatest bottles of Burgundy in many years. Also
available in magnums at $67.50, $384.90 the case of six.
