MARCEL BRUT 1952 IN SPLITS .

It has become an annual event for us to offer a fine French Champagne in the convenient split
size as a Spring-Summer special value. Keep several of these handy little bottles in your refrig-
erator and serve unexpected guests Champagne at a moment’s notice—the cost will be hardly
more than a generous Scotch and Soda.

MARCEL BRUT 1952

This fine, dry example of Brut Champagne from France deserves its reputation as New York’s
best Champagne value. At this lower price level, in face of serious frost damage in France and
much higher prices there, we urge that you buy now and anticipate your future requirements.

AYALA GOLD LABEL BRUT 1952 .. .

in Champagne, quite its equal. Half bottles are available at $2.69 each, $58.50 the case of 24.

well below $6.00 the bottle.
