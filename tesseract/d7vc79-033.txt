DENIS-MOUNIE
GOLD LEAF COGNAC

an Outstanding Cognac
at a dramatically
modest price

The Cognac fanciers of France
and England have long known
about the dry, well-balanced
qualities of the brandy pro-
duced by the venerable firm of
Denis-Mounie. Its virtues are
now starting to become recog-
nized in America.

Since we are living in a cost-
conscious period, it would be
remiss of us not to bring to your
attention the fact that this su-
perb brandy can be acquired
for less than 6.67 the bottle —
and for less than 75.00 the
Case. In our opinion, it can hold
its head high in open competi-
tion against other equally
worthy companions from Cog-
nac that might command more
than 2.00 the bottle more.

LARRESSINGLE ARMAGNAC

Armagnac comes from the land
of d’Artagnan, and Larressingle
is one of its leading disciples.
There is respect in France for
the excellence of this 10 Year
Old brandy—rich with earthy fla-
vor, well-balanced and crowned
with delightful bouquet. As you
can see, the cost is modest

 

enough. (Below 87.10 case)

OLD HENNESSY COGNAC
IN BACCARAT DECANTER

What a fantastic one bottle gift!
The Baccarat Decanter is an
absolute beauty and commands
this price even when purchased
empty. The Cognac is not ordi-
nary, but the very aged Bras
d’Or quality of Hennessy. The
satin lined box adds a jewelry-
like quality to the gift.

LAURENT-PERRIER
GRAND SIECLE

Louis XIV loved Cham-
pagne; made his whole
court drink it for ‘stom-
ach’s sake.’ Here is a
replica of the bottle
which he favored. Note
the beautiful Versailles
box in which it is housed.
A giant among Cham-
pagnes—expensive, but
worth it. (165.78 case)

DELAMAIN PALE & DRY

  

SC PAt

} Dclamains

During our recent stay in Paris, we were
astonished to see that every renowned bar
and outstanding restaurant prominently dis-
played and featured DELAMAIN PALE &
DRY Cognac.

We subsequently met Mr. Delamain and were
impressed by his uncompromising dedica-
tion to excellence, and his insistence on pro-
ducing a Cognac of impeccable quality, pale
in color and dry to the palate.

This brandy lends itself to gift-giving be-
cause each bottle is housed in the beautiful

box you see above.
