266 VIN ROSE 1959 (in pot bottle). . . . . . . 1.59 17.99

The wines of Beaujolais and Pouilly Fuisse in the “pot” bottle
have long been favorites among our wine-loving clientele. In this
same wine growing district, there is a grower by the name of
Louis Savoye who produced an outstanding Vin Rose—fruity,
charming and mouth-filling in flavor. Not much was made—and

YT | we persuaded him to have his fine pink wine bottled in the “pot”
bottle to enhance its captivating qualities.

Clair Dau, one of the best of the Burgundian growers, is famed
for his Chambertins, Bonnes Mares and Musignys, but he does
produce for his own pleasure and for those of his neighbors, a
most excellent pink wine made out of the noble Pinot Noir grape.
The spirit of this superior grape translates itself into the best
pink wine we have ever tasted and the 1959 is the best Vin Rose
that Clair Dau has ever made. We have but 60 cases.

 

669 TAVEL 1959 (Clos de Vaucroze) . 2.19 24.90
If one were seeking out the best single example of pink wine
produced in the town of Tavel, we would suspect that it would
be the thoroughbred that comes from the Vaucroze vineyard.

(| Pink wine of true distinction.
