young, cheerful 1955 Alsatian Rosé at only
Sia

Distillation,’ the best Bourbon I have tasted in

A few cases of the remarkable ‘1942
years, has just reached us — and it’s only $6.49
the bottle the glorious 1953 Chateau
bottled Clarets, waiting for the mild May
weather before making the ocean journey
have just arrived. By all means acquire some
at the low present cost before they become
run-away in price ... Our wine scouts have
brought back some remarkable 1934 Clarets
which are described on Page 13... one of the
most extraordinary white wines of our gen-
eration is the Schloss Johannisberg Cabinet
Auslese 1953. It is hard to come by as good
seats for ‘My Fair Lady’ a suggestion —
acquire some if you want German wine at
its best _ another new arrival from Bur-
gundy is the Grand Montrachet 1953 of The-
venin — a Classic wine .. . all of you know
and respect Noilly Prat Dry Vermouth; now,
for the first time, the Noilly Prat Sweet has
arrived in the United States; (serve it over
the rocks, or with soda, or to improve your
mixed drinks ).

Many of
our customers who live in Long Island or
Westchester have expressed amazement over
the speed with which their orders reach them.
It is not infrequent to have someone call us
after five in the evening only to find the pack-
age in their home, 40 miles away, the follow-

ing morning. The answer is simple — these

 

 

deliveries are made for us by United Parcel
Service which covers, with speedy efficiency,
Long Island, Westchester and the boroughs.
The reason I am mentioning this service at
this time, is because some of you may be mov-
ing far out to Long Island, or somewhere
up-state, and will want to take advantage of
this ‘Annual Spring Sale.’ Simply tell us the
date you want delivery and your wishes will

be carried out.

I am delighted
with the freshness and dry pleasantness of the
Muscadet 1953 ...Sherry drinkers should not
overlook the bone-dry and pale Wisdom’s
Fino Olivar, sale priced at only $1.73; serve

 

Thoroughbred Clarets that en-
joy the highest reputation on

the Bordeaux market.

All of

great vintage year. They can be
enjoyed today and will become
even better as they achieve more

maturity.

on-the-rocks — as an interesting Spring aperi-
tif... for those who wish to maintain a high
standard in their Scotch whisky drinking,
there is no better combination of quality and
value than Fortnum & Mason’s Red Seal at
only $5.69 ... the 1952 Clarets are now com-
ing into their own and can be drunk with
pleasure today and still maintain a brilliant
future ... one of the most intriguing white
Burgundies I have run across is the Clos Blanc
de Vougeot 1953... and let us not fail to
pay heed to the 1953 red Burgundies, the best

year since the war, while they are still around.

as we announce
that a member of our firm, Jack Aaron, has

just won a grand award in a national contest

 

for his essay on the role of the wine and spirits
merchant. I must say, it was a beautiful job
and we are indeed proud of the distinction he
achieved.

To Happy Summer Living!
