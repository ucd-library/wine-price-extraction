As far as we know, Chateau Vignelaure in Provence is the
only vineyard that produces its wines without herbicides,
chemicals, ete.—It is featured at the famed Moulins des
Mougins. The Saumur is a wonderful red wine from the

Loire. Spanna makes a bid to being the best red wine of

Italy. The Montilla Solera dates its heritage back to
1750—rather like the finest old Sherry you have ever
tasted. The Bollinger Champagne Nature is simple Cham-
pagne, bone-dry, and without bubbles - and delightful.
