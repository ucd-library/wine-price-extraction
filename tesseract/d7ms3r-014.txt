Here are the local ‘vin du pays’ wines of France that bring
so much joy to tourists who explore the French countryside.
Each has its own personality, its own message, its own touch
of charm. They were not easy to come by since many of the
growers are not export-minded. Undoubtedly, you have
heard about some of them, have read of their virtues in
literature—and we happily bring them to you.

Produced in the Anjou area of the Loire Valley, made from
the superior Cabernet grape, providing more depth and
flavor than the average Anjou Rose. Nicolas.

This estate-bottling by Domaine Closel recently won the
First Gold Award at the Paris fair as the best within its class.

nache grape, and is quite undistinguishable from Tavel itself.
This one is an absolute beauty.

TAVEL ROSE 1970.......... 2.49 26.90
No ordinary Tavel this one, it is estate-bottled by M. Bernard.
It is of the current 1970 vintage, its youth retaining its color,
fruit and freshness. Because the soil is arid and rocky, the
yield per acre is small, resulting in more flavor and bouquet
than is usually associated with a rosé.

CASTEL ROUBINE ........ 2.49 26.90
Fstate-bottled at outstanding vineyard in Provence. Con-
sidered the best rosé of area.

CASSIS ROSE 1969 3 ee 2.49 26.90

the Mediterranean. Estate-bottled, Domaine du Paternel.
ROSE DE SANCERRE 1969............ 2.59 27.95

best rosé of all France. Estate-bottled, André Bart.
