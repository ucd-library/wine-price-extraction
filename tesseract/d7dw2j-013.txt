Bottle Case

WHELENER SONNENUHR

GPAUPERSE 0) 7-0 oe 5.79 66.05
Here again, we extoll the virtues of the Prum
family for the amazingly great wine they pro-
duce under their name. This one is a ‘Spatlese’
from the best vineyard. Quantity limited.
Estate-bottled, Sebastian Alois Prum. (#696)
EITELSBACHER KARTHAUSER-

HOFBERG KRONENBERG

IWABINE MG ns cee ae 5.89 66.50
Eitelsbach is a tiny town on the Ruwer, a tribu-
tary of the Moselle. Since its splendid vine-
yard once belonged to a Carthusian Monastery,
the vineyard region bears the name ‘Kart-
hauserhofberg. These 70 acres are broken up
into tiny vineyard plots. The best one is ‘Kron-
enberg.’ In a great year like 1975, you will
discover airy lightness coupled with austerity;
and a bouquet of incredible floweriness and
distinction. We quote Frank Schoonmaker,
“Authentic Eitelsbacher has been made by
several producers; the labels bearing the
names of Rautenstrauch or Tyrell are, by a
wide margin, the best.” Estate-bottled, W.
Tyrell. (#772)
SCHARZHOFBERG AUSLESE ... 6.49 74.00
Frank Schoonmaker, with whom we travelled
through the vineyards of France and Germany
often, would tell us, while driving, that ‘Mont-
rachet’ and ‘Scharzhofberg’ are the two best
white vineyards of the world. Skeptical? Try
a bottle—you will come back for a case. Estate-
bottled, von Volxem. (#773)
WEHLENER SONNENUHR

MUOSEESE ee 6.79 77.45
One reaches a peak when he climbs Mt. Ever-
est—one also reaches a peak when he drinks
‘Wehlener Sonnenuhr Auslese 1975’ produced
by a ‘Prum.’ Estate-bottled, Sebastian Alois
Prum. (#775)
SCHARZHOFBERGER

Bemis ee ee ks 7.99 92.50
The world clamors for Dr. Thanisch’s ‘Bern-
kasteler Doktor.’ It equally clamors for Egon
Muller’s ‘Scharzhofberger.’ Both are hard to
come by; both are always expensive—this wine
is worth over $15.00. Estate-bottled, Egon
Muller. (#688)

1976 MOSELLE WINES

Two splendid Moselles have just reached us.
The Spatlesen and Auslesen will arrive in July.
In the interval we are pleased to report that,
like the first crocuses of Spring, we offer you
the first 1976 estate-bottled Moselles available
in America. Try a case of each—you will not re-
gret it. The price is astonishingly low—not even
the thriftiest of burgomeisters on the Moselle
can do much better—even in Germany today.
Sheer perfection for Summer drinking—fresh,
young fruity, with a flower-like bouquet.
BERNKASTLER KURFUERSTLAY

AN a a oa 2 2.99 34.75
Just arrived. We have tasted it and find it rich
in fruit and fragrance, but light. If ever there
was a wine designed for Summer drinking,
this is it. Estate-bottled, Zentralkellerei. (#524)
PIESPORTER MICHELSBERG

Be oh ia 3.49 39.75
The good wines of Piesport are the most popu-
lar of the Moselles. Here is a ‘Spatlese’—which
means it is rich and full. The fruit pleases the
palate and is compensated by sufficient acidity
to give it balance and refreshing, thirst-quench-
ing qualities. A perfect introduction to the
greatness of the 1976 Moselles. Estate-bottled,
Maringer. (#529)

1975 RHINE WINES

Note that we have eliminated all lesser re-
gionals and vineyards from this 1975 category,
one of the best vintage years on the Rhine
during our generation. Even the least costly
of all— Schloss Vollrads — will permit you to
participate in the fruit, balance, and character
of this great vintage year.

SCHLOSS VOLLRADS, Bottle Case

KABINETT GRUNLACK ..... 3.79 43.25
The Vollrads’ castle dates from the year 1355.
No wine that does not have fine elegance and
bouquet is ever permitted to bear the label
‘Schloss Vollrads.’ Estate-bottled, Graf Ma-
tushka. (#732)
NIERSTEINER ORBEL

ICA BENE yoo os ee. 3.89 44.35
Nierstein is the foremost wine town of the
Rheinhessen. One of its great vineyards is
Orbel. R. Senfter, the estate-bottler, is highly
regarded throughout Germany for the excel-
lence of what comes from his vines. (#518)
STEINBERGER RIESLING

ICABIN Beeler 4.89 55.75
The same Cistercian Order that created Clos
Vougeot also constructed the Steinberg vine-
yard in the heart of Germany’s Rheingau in the
12th century. Now it is the property of the
German State Domaine. Steinbergers exhibit
full body, authority, great class, power and
depth of flavor. (#728)
ELTVILLER SONNENBERG

IWAIBINE Dy hc 3.99 46.75
The best vineyard is ‘Sonnenberg.’ The most
famed producer, Graf Eltz. A wise choice for
Summer drinking. Estate-bottled, Graf Eltz.
(#724)
RUDESHEIMER BERG

ROTTLAND KABINETT..... 4.29 48.95
Squeezed in between the Rhine river and the
steep vineyards, Rudesheim is perhaps the
leading tourist village of Germany. The best
vineyards are west of the town and bear the
prefix ‘Berg.’ ‘Rottland’ is the best vineyard in
this choice ‘Berg’ area. Estate-bottled, German
State Domaine. (#735)
HATTENHEIMER NUSBRUNNEN

IWABINE VDD. 3 2s eee 4.59 52.35
Here again, ‘Nusbrunnen’ is the best vineyard
in Hattenheim and Freiherr Langwerth von
Simmern is acknowledged as its best producer.
(#781)
SCHLOSS JOHANNISBERGER

GELBACH 755 4.99 56.90
Germany’s most famous vineyard. It was first
planted by Emperor Charlemagne and was ulti-
mately ceded by the Congress of Vienna to the
Emperor of Austria who then bestowed it on
Prince von Metternich. It is still the Metternich
property and their home. This wine has char-
acter and is utterly delicious. (#658)
ERBACHER MARCOBRUNN

Ba nee oN oe seis 6.79 77.45
On the whole, the Marcobrunners are unsur-
passed by the wines of any other German vine-
yard — fruity, racy, well-balanced, they have
truly astonishing bouquet and breed. Estate-
bottled, Schloss Schoenborn. (#647)
FORSTER KIRCHENSTUCK

BEAVERS (Cyto oie eyo ryes 6.99 79.70
‘Kirchenstuck’ is considered the best single
vineyard of the Pfalz, or Palatinate. Though
full-bodied, this wine has extraordinary ele-
gance and bouquet due to the remarkable
black basalt in the land. In addition, this is an
estate-bottling of the best producer in the area,
Dr. Burklin-Wolf. (#661)
RAUENTHALER BAIKEN

DP UG: be eae es 7.69 87.70
The vineyards of Rauenthal constitute the
most valuable agriculture land per acre in
Germany because of the recognized distinction
of their wines. They are especially notable for
their spiciness, fruit, and breed. In a great
vintage year like 1975, they are truly incompar-
able. ‘Baiken’ is the best vineyard and Graf
Eltz is the most important producer in Rauen-
thal. Estate-bottled, Graf Eltz. (#739)

UNBLENDED.
COGNAC e

The knowledgeable Cognac drinkers of
France consider this the best example of
Brandy produced in their country—re-
gardless of price or age. It is a glorious
estate-bottled Cognac that was produced
during a great vintage year (1949) in the
most celebrated part of the Cognac
country, “Grande Fine Champagne.” It
has remained in its unblended state in
barrel from its birth until the present.
It is the kind of Cognac that would win
plaudits even if sold for $50 the bottle.
At $29.50, it is possibly the best value in
truly great Cognac available.

Nice. It is the only vineyard we know of that
does not use herbicides or pesticides in its

Moulin de Mougins 3-star restaurant situated
near Cannes. Superb. (#734)

ever tasted. It normally sells for over $20
