1960 Vintage

No. Bottle Case
650 CHATEAU LASCOMBES (Margaux). 2.99 32.30

Alexis Lichine, the ‘maestro’ of Chateau Lascombes, has long con-
tended that the best values at his*vineyard can be found among
the unfashionable years. His personal enthusiasm is for the wine
which he produced during the 1960 vintage. It is just reaching per-
fection now. Serve it proudly. Also available in magnums at 6.38
each, 35.30 the case.

493 CHATEAU CALON SEGUR
fae te ee 3.29 35.55

Normally the heaviest of clarets—a particular balance was struck
here because of the relative lightness of the year.

479 CHATEAU COS D’ESTOURNEL
ee ee es. 3.29 35.55

Another example of when St. Estephe can sometimes reach its
greatest balance in a better than average year rather than in a
great year. Ready now.

136 CHATEAU LA MISSION
raUT BRION (Graves) ............ 5.49 59.30

We recently visited the Woltner Freres, proprietors of this glori-
ous vineyard. They proudly served us their 1960. We were de-
lighted—and so will your guests and you, should you acquire it.

134 CHATEAU CHEVAL BLANC
Pe een. ee, 5.79 62.25

We live in an age where the acquisition of a first growth such as
Cheval Blanc at $5.79 is no ordinary event. Here you are drinking
wine of true distinction at a price that does not make too deep a
dent in the family budget.

187 CHATEAU LAFITE ROTHSCHILD

eee gs 6.99 75.50
The 1961 Lafite is over $20.00 and the 1959 fetches just under $30.
As value, this 1960 at $6.99 is not simply “good’—it is “sensa-
tional”,

 

We quote from Sherry’s vintage chart—“sandwiched between two
great years, the 1960 vintage has suffered from being unfashion-
able. In fact, the ’60s are better than average wines. The early heat
caused an excellent flowering and the promise of a big crop. This
promise was fulfilled—but later rains washed away some of the
hopes. The ’60s are very attractive for current consumption—soft
wines with a pronounced bouquet—among the best values in good
claret on the market today”.

The 1963 vintage was a complete disaster in St. Emilion and
Pomerol. However, because of more favorable weather and a
higher ratio of Cabernet Sauvignon grapes which are not as sub-
ject to “grey rot’, the best 63s can be found in the Graves area,
particularly at Haut Brion and La Mission Haut Brion and in some
favored vineyards of the Medoc. We recently tried some Chateau
Latour 1963—it was astonishing—the depth of flavor, the reflection
of the noble soil and heritage of Chateau Latour that was captured
in the bouquet and flavor, the breed and balance. Chateau Latour
1963 is undoubtedly a noble claret, perfect for immediate drinking
—but at $4.49 the bottle, it is not just good value, but a sensational
opportunity to acquire good claret at a price that will conform to
most budgets. Skeptical?—please try it.

5100 CHATEAU LATOUR (Pauillac) .... 6.99 75.50

Chateau Latour normally takes a decade to age. This is not true of
1960. It is now reaching the point where you can drink it at its
best. Try it for your holiday dinner parties. You will be amazed.

1963 Vintage

258 CHATEAU DUCRU BEAUCAILLOU
et UMICH as 2.49 26.90

A “sleeper”. Don’t make the mistake of ignoring a really fine wine
because the year is unfashionable.

168 CHATEAU LATOUR HAUT BRION

(tees) 8 2.99 32.30
This wine is actually produced adjacent to the Chateau La Mission
Haut Brion vineyard—only 1,000 cases are made each year. Re-
markable “finesse and elegance”.

698 CHATEAU LA MISSION
HAUT BRION (Graves) ............ 3.79 40.95

Remember, the weather in Graves was relatively good in 1963. This
velvety, generous and noble wine proves it clearly to any dis-
criminating palate.

634 CHATEAU LATOUR (Pauillac) ...... 4.49 48.50

The most robust and sturdiest of clarets, deep-colored, slow to
mature. Just coming into its own. Since 1963 is a light year, and
Chateau Latour is a heavy wine, the combination of both will give
you truly great wine, reflecting noble heritage, at a price less than
half of what you would normally pay for a great claret of this
calibre.

5035 CHATEAU LAFITE ROTHSCHILD

(Pate 4.99 53.90
Impeccable breed, considerable fruit and relatively light, lacking
the authority of the great years. Nevertheless, at this price, it is a
wine that should hardly be ignored.

5086 CHATEAU HAUT BRION (Graves). 4.99 53.90
We spent four days at Chateau Haut Brion and got to know the
wines well. Here we are not dealing with the greatness of '61, 59,
or 64 but with a most acceptable claret, still in the big leagues.
Beyond question, a supreme success in 1963 and the peer of the
best produced in the Medoc.
