fine impact. Here is a gin that can
make a contribution to your
Martinis.

 

 

“22-C” America’s historic Bourbon is the
claim of VIRGINIA GENTLEMAN, boitled
only in full quarts.

*“22-D” We are
surprised to
learn how much
national demand
there is for the
CHERRY KI-
JAFA of Den-
mark. We were
impressed by the
low price, tasted
it and tound it
most delicious. It
is particularly
popular among

women. 3.29
