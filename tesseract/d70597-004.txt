Invitation Jo A Wine Lust

BY JAMES BEARD—acclaimed as America’s leading food authority;
author of the current Book-of-the-Month Club selection “James
Beard’s American Cookery”; co-author with Sam Aaron of “How To
Eat Better For Less Money’; associate at Sherry-Lehmann for almost

three decades.

“This 1972 wine list of Sherry-Lehmann astonishes
me by its range, depth and discrimination. For al-
most a half-century | have been travelling the world
collecting wine lists everywhere—and yet, | cannot
readily produce any from my library collection that
can quite match this one as a complete compen-
dium of the wines of the world. | am grateful to Sam
and Michael Aaron for the research and love that
they have expended, making this dramatically com-
plete list possible.

We live in an age where the demand for good wine

increases 15% annually, with little capacity on the
part of the vineyards to meet the thirsty needs of

wine lovers. As a result, the cost of many of the
world-famous vineyard names have spiralled astro-
nomically. It is perhaps because of this, that Sam
and Michael have devoted so much energy in these
pages, towards offering a great variety of good,
honest wines between $2 and $4 the bottle. It was
not easy to accomplish, but it was achieved here.

There is adventure, joy and challenge in travelling
the by-paths of the vineyards of the world. It is a
trip—despite possibly a few mishaps along the road
—that all of us will surely enjoy taking. | wish you
a joyous Odyssey and happy tasting enroute.
