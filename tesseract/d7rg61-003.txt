Red Bordeaux

Select a great red wine while still in its infancy, limit
yourself to a superb vintage year - and you will have some-
thing that will substantially increase in value as it ages
in the bottle. This is the theme of WINE AS AN INVESTMENT
a lead article in the current July 7th Saturday Review.

Its authors Clifton Fadiman and Sam Aaron present a persua-

sive case for putting your money into the great vintages of

Bordeaux, Burgundy and California. Their most striking ex-

ample is the bottle of 1806 Chateau Lafite-Rothschild that
eu s Fe fetched $28,000 at the May 24th Heublein Rare Wine Auction,
pictured here being lovingly held by wine expert Alexander McNally.

Some amazing facts: at the Heublein auction in '78, we saw a case of Lafite '66
sell for $1,400; Petrus '61 for $1,600; Lafite ‘61 for $1,650; and Mouton '45 for
$1,800. Will the great '75 Bordeaux achieve equal astronomic levels? We don't have
a crystal ball, but we we do know the experts consider ‘75 to be one of the great
vintages of the century - in league with '45, '61 and '70. Also, almost no '75s
remain at the vineyards, and the First Growths - if obtainable at all - now fetch
over $600 the case wholesale in Bordeaux!

Will prices continue to climb? Wine economists predict that with ever-increasing
demand (in which the American dollar is at considerable disadvantage), coupled
with diminishing inventories - prices will march up much faster than inflation.
