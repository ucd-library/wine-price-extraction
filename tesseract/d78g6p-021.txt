RIVERO'S "TROCADERO" AMONTILLADO

A good Amontillado develops out of the Fino family, ac-
quiring its own unique characteristics as it matures; the
color becomes more amber-like, the flavor more nutty.

Sherry, This concept was developed in Bristol, England.
Cream Sherries are extremely popular throughout the
English-speaking world.

appetizer, 'Mantecoso' is a by-word in Spain. Â°

perfect for modern tastes.
