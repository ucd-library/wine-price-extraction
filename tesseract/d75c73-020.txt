COTES-DU-RHONE

The Cotes-du-Rhone, although it is
not too many miles south of Bur-
gundy, because of different weather
and sun conditions, does not neces-
sarily follow the same vintage graph
that prevails along the Cote d’Or.
However, it did prove similar in the
fact that not much more than half
a crop was gathered and that prices
did open about 40% higher than
1967. Nevertheless, the quality
heights achieved in Burgundy sim-
ply did not prevail here. There is no
question but that the wines are good,
entirely acceptable and destined to
be appreciated, but they simply lack
the concentration and guts that
make great years in this area—such
years as 1961 and 1966. With Bur-
gundy prices;at new high levels, it
appears surprising to us that fine
wine such as Chateauneuf-du-Pape
have not found an increasing de-
mand and have not gone up even
further in price. They still remain
within the economic reach of a wine
drinker of modest means.

THE WINES OF
THE RHINE & MOSELLE

The weather conditions that prevail
in France are not necessarily appli-
cable in Germany, because we must
remember that the wines of the
Rhine and Moselle are grown in a
more northerly altitude than that of
Labrador and spend much of their
existence reaching out for the sun’s
warmth to survive. And as in the in-
stance of human beings, the vine’s
‘struggle to survive’ is what gives
German wines their character, com-
plexity and finesse.

In the Rheingau, the three weeks of
foggy weather, just before the har-
vest, proved detrimental to the
ripening of the grapes in the lower
sites, near the Rhine River itself.
However, the higher hill sites were
less affected by the fog—obtained
more sun and produced some truly
extraordinary wines—particularly
at Schloss Vollrads, Schloss Johan-
nisberg and Steinberg. Since the re-
sults are rather mixed here, ranging
from high average to excellent, both
the wine merchant and the wine con-
sumer must make a selection based
on the location of the vineyard,
and the wine merchants tasting
judgment.

During the period that fog prevailed
over the Rhine, the Moselle Valley
was bathed in sunshine. As a result,
the Moselles typify the fine vintages
of the ’60s. They are exceptionally
fine, fruity and elegant. They are
destined to please and bring much
tasting reward to German wine
connoisseurs, who have enjoyed fine
previous vintages. The ‘Berncasteler
Doctor’ vineyard has maintained its
dramatic and superior finesse, is be-
ing rationed because of low produc-
tion and has hit a-new high in cost.
the ‘Scharzhofberger’ vineyard, the

one we personally consider the best
in Germany, reflects in its quality,
the full quota of sunshine it has re-
ceived, and can be considered one of
the best examples of Moselle pro-
duced during the decade.

“HOW TO EAT BETTER FOR
LESS MONEY” is a most timely
title for the book that has been writ-
ten by two of our associates, James
Beard and Sam Aaron. Simon &
Schuster announces the publication
date of July 28th. Despite the mod-
esty of these two gentlemen, this
volume will not enter the ‘world of
books’ without its share of fanfare
and advance drum-beating. ‘Ladies
Home Journal’ will feature a rather
detailed summary of the tome in
their forthcoming September issue.
The ‘Cookbook Guild’ have selected
“How To Eat Better For Less
Money” to send their subscribers in
the near future. And the national
publication ‘Better Homes & Gar-
dens’ have chosen it for their book
club. On top of all this recognition,
those of you who subscribe to the
‘Book-of-the-Month’ Club, will be

able to make it your pick for the
month, since it has been chosen as
an ‘alternate selection.’

Being curious by nature, we decided
to find out why this particular book
has achieved so much attention in
advance of publication from leading
magazines and book-clubs of
America. In interviewing wine and
food editors who have seen the gal-
ley proofs, we discovered that this
work genuinely has something new
and important to say—particularly
at a time when people have learned
to be sophisticated about food, be-
coming more involved in creative
cooking, wine drinking—and would
like to do this without making too
serious a dent in the family budget.

 

 

If the book should fall in your hands,
you will see that James Beard
focuses on many food recipes that
will please the discriminating, pro-
vides tips on how to shop, suggests
taste-improving short cuts, and gen-
erally brings many intriguing new
pleasures to the table without the
caviar approach.

kitchen and cellar research for “How
To Eat Better For Less Money.”

And intertwined with James Beard’s
text on food, you will be able to
profit from Sam Aaron’s advice on
how to evaluate wines and spirits,
how to achieve more interesting
drinks saving money in the process,
and how to entertain wisely, well and
easily.

The requests for the book “How To
Eat Better For Less Money” have
already started to reach the book
stores. You can reserve your copy at
your favorite dealer. If you are im-
patient and would rather not wait,
the easiest way would be to simply
mail a check for $7.30 ($6.95 plus
35¢ handling) to SHERIDAN
PRESS, 175 Great Neck Road, Great
Neck, N.Y.11021. (Or, if you prefer,
you need merely order the book, they
will mail it to you, and bill you for
$7.30 later.)

The rather courageous, as-of-the-
moment concept of the book so in-
trigued Aline Saarinen, that she has
requested Sam Aaron to appear on
her N.B.C. television show ‘For
Women Only” to join a panel that
will discuss “Dining In and Out.”
Among the participants, who will
face stimulating questions from a
studio audience will be Craig Clai-
borne, food editor of the New York
Times; Helen McCully, food editor
of ‘House Beautiful’; and Charles
Masson, proprietor of the famed ‘la
Grenouille’ Restaurant. This televi-
sion show, that will surely cause
much interest among wine and food
lovers, super-market shoppers, and
restaurant proprietors will be tele-
vised for five consecutive days dur-
ing early Fall. If you follow the
Television listings in your news-
paper, you will know precisely when

it will take place—or you can phone

N.B.C. or Sherry’s during early Sep-

tember to get the exact time and

dates. ae
