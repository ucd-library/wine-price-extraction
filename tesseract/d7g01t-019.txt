RED BURGUNDY

That Americans have shown a new and astonishing awareness
of good wine over the past decade is now a commonplace. When
this attention turns to great French wines, Bordeaux’s famed
chateaux seem to attract most of the interest. Long convinced
that a little renewed rivalry brings out the best in both partici-
pants, we have here taken especial care to search out supreme
examples of the remarkable wines of Burgundy. If the list below
widens a few wine horizons to include a love of Bourgogne
rouge, then we will be pleased.

1973 VINTAGE
Delightful, fruity wines produced, but they must be picked
carefully. Relatively quick maturing.

COTES DE NUITS VILLAGES........... 3.99 45.50
The Céte de Nuits—the northern half of the Céte d’Or
lying north of the town of Beaune—is the home of Bur-
gundy’s greatest vineyards—Chambertin, Musigny,
Romanée-Conti. And it also grows this very good wine.
A ‘best buy’ fully blessed with body, fruit and bouquet.

Incomparable is the word for Musigny. Delicate and
feminine where its peers are dramatic and powerful,
Musigny is rightly renowned for a transcendent harmony
of complex flavor and generous bouquet that sets it
apart from every other regal Burgundy. This eminent
example from the highly regarded grower, Roland Théve-
1in, is only now coming into its own.
