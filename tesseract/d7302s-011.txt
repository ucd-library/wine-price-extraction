Here are the great, full bodied 1959 white wines of Burgundy of much
depth and character, similar to the 1947s, and entirely remarkable.
Practically all of these are here in bottle, quite ready to drink, and proud
heralds of the new heights achieved by an outstanding vintage year.

Estate bottled, Caves des Grand Cru

We recently visited this cooperative, adjacent to Pouilly Fuisse and report that
| their green-gold wines, produced by the local farmers are excellent, particularly
in 1959, and represents outstanding value for those who want a wine of class
at modest cost.

BEAUJOLAIS BLANC 1959 1.99 22.65
Estate bottled, Marcel Robert

We quote from a letter received from the vineyard:—‘“Unequalled fruitiness,
a perfectly composed wine, full—without being dry, very fine. Rivals the very
best Pouilly Fuisses”’.

*693 CHABLIS BUTTEAUX 1959... 2.99 32.95 |
Estate bottled, Robert Monin
A superb Premier Cru Chablis, reminiscent of the 1947s. Relatively full bodied,

exceptional depth of flavor for a Chablis, and completely harmonious. Recom-
mended unreservedly.

692 MEURSAULT PERRIERES 1959 __| 3.49 38.50

Estate bottled, Domaine Ampeau

Great Meursault from the Domaine Ampeau have long been familiar creatures

to wine drinkers at Sherry’s. They rank among the great white Burgundies, BAY \y
somewhat softer and less powerful than the Montrachets and with a noble | (ireees
distinction of their own. In our opinion, the “Perrieres” can be regarded as the “ALT Wy
best vineyard of Meursault and this one, from Ampeau, is truly magnificent.

*688 CHABLIS PREUSES 1959. .——sistw 3.59 39.75

Estate bottled, M. Servin

Here we are dealing with a remarkable white wine — a Grand Cru Chablis

(there are only 8 small vineyards entitled to this classification) of the 1959

vintage. We first met M.Servin in 1950 and thought his Chablis Preuses 1947

fabulous. We believe his 1959 is even better. Relatively high in alcohol and : UARD wy
body, it nevertheless has a firmness associated with the wine of this district. WTP

665 CORTON CHARLEMAGNE 1959 3.59 39.75

Estate bottled, Dubreuil-Fontaine

Corton Charlemagne yields a tiny production and on the steepest slopes. Great
distinction and subtle bouquet. A superb 1959.
