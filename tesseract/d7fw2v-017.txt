crease in the popularity of
both AMBASSADOR 8
year and AMBASSADOR
12 year old Scotches rep-
resents a phenomenon on
the American scene. De-
lightful for gift giving.

 

“18-B” BOLS sends us from
Holland their delightful Co-
coa and Blackberry Liqueur
in an authentic and handsome
Delft jug. It makes a delight-
ful gift.

 

“18-C”” Somehow, on
each of our trips to
the vineyards we
manage to detour to
the Cognac area to
visit our good friends
av Prine, it is une
doubtedly the supe-
rior quality of their
Cognac that inspires
this pleasant visit.
Tretr V.S.0-P., dry,
mellow, is second to
none.
