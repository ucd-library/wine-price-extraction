CLASSIFIED CHATEAU WHITE WINES

All choice wines all excellent vintage years.
We have been fortunate in finding modest quan-
tities of Chateau-bottled Barsacs and Sauternes in
the four fine vintages since 1934, wines which
have always been favorites with American con-
noisseurs, and happily, at prices considerably be-
low the current prices in the Bordeaux market.
Prices reflect only a part of present French costs.

A great Burgundy is unsurpassed by any other
natural wine, but authentic Burgundies, to say
nothing of great ones, are always scarce and
never cheap. Faked Burgundies are plentiful and
always dear. Less than any other wine can a Bur-
gundy be judged by its name, year, and price
upon a list. Good Burgundies and adulterated
Burgundies are put out under many of the famous
names, and prices vary widely.

Our extensive offerings include magnificent wines
purchased by us directly from the great proprie-
tors of the Céte d'Or, which have been grown
and bottled at their estates without passing
through dealers’ hands. Burgundies of this char-
cter are bargains at any price and are seldom

ound in commerce, even in France.

War losses were heavy in Burgundy. Many pro-
prietors lost their entire reserves to the Germans.
A few were able to hold part of our reservations
made in the great years of 1934 and 1937 and
we are particularly proud to offer our assortments
of those superb vintages. The liberation of the
area in 1944 saved some portions of the great
vintages of 1942 and 1943 and especially in
white Burgundies which mature more quickly
than the reds, our offerings are especially notable.

Quotations shown ab

BURGUNDY RED

A fine red Burgundy is a bolder and more forth-
right wine than Claret. It overwhelms all other
wines with the fragrance of its bouquet and the
soft but robust fullness of its body.
