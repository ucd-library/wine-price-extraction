We quote the Sichel report: “Rhone prices, relatively low and
stable for years, suddenly have taken off. Chateauneuf-du-Pape,
which is treated as a superior Cotes-du-Rhone in France, but
as a kind of Burgundy in the United States, cost almost 400%
more now than it did two years ago. This is not true of Cotes-
du-Rhone, which has increased only by a mere 50%—it is this
Rhone area that remains the most reasonably priced supplier
of Appelation Controlée red wine.”

You can look for clear, balanced red wine of character here—
particularly when you can now acquire the best Cotes-du-
Rhone Rouge we have ever tasted for only $25.95 the case. Nor
should you ignore Crozes Hermitage, Cornas and St. Joseph—
all superior estate bottlings from some of the best soil of the
Rhone.

dined with the grower re-

cently and he advised us that the superiority of his red wine is
not only based on his excellent vinification, but also because
he uses a higher ratio of the superior grape variety, Petit Syrah,
compared to the more common Grenache grape of the area.
Whatever the reason ,in several decades of being wine mer-
chants, we have never had a red wine that captured the imagi-
nation of those who want a good $2.29 bottle of red wine more
effectively than this one. Also available in half bottle and mag-
nums at $3.00 the case additional.

is considerably less expensive. Estate-bottled, Fayolle.

Produced at a celebrated vineyard only a five minute drive
south of the famed Pyramide Restaurant in Vienne. The in-
credibly steep vineyard faces due south, held up by sturdy re-
taining walls, and everything must be cultivated by hand. Deep
in color, full-bodied, amazingly long life, and everyone looks
for the aroma of violets when they drink ‘Céte Rotie.’ Estate-
botled, Domaine Devieux.

Condrieu is located about three miles south of Céte Rotie on

LOIRE VALLEY WHITE

The Loire River meanders at its own delicious slow pace for
600 miles through France and empties into the Atlantic at
Nantes. Along its banks, you can discover some of the best
wine values of the world. The Gros Plant will delight you, the
Muscadet will bring joy to your warm weather living, and the
Quincy, Sancerre, and Pouilly-Blanc-Fumé will provide depth
of flavor, beautiful bouquet and utter deliciousness—all at a
liveable price.

607 GROS PLANT 1971 (Nantais) ............ 2.79 30.15

the Atlantic Ocean. It is the constant companion to seafood
in Brittany because of its refreshing bone-dryness, lightness
and delicacy.

Though no vintage appears on the label of this delicately dry,
crisp, refreshing summer wine—actually, it is of the current
1972 vintage, bottled in early Spring to retain its freshness.
L’Huitriere is the French word for oyster—hence, an ideal com-
panion with shell fish and a friendly partner of all seafoods.

Georges Gaudry is the estate-bottler here. Don’t let the rela-

ous bid to being the best single dry white wine produced in the
charming wine town of Pouilly-sur-Loire.
