A “SINGLE BOTTLE” BECOMES A
GIFT OF HISTORIC INTEREST.

Since precious few bottles exist in the
world, we suggest prompt acquisition—
even a single bottle will add its touch of
lustre to a distinguished cellar, create
interest at the holiday dinner party, and
give special meaning to the Christmas gift.

COLLECTORS ATTENTION!

The 12 rare Madeiras listed above would
cost you $245.00 if purchased individually.
To tempt the connoisseur, the one who is
interested in fine and rare old things
whether they be antiques or wine, and the
true collector of rare wines, we make this
special offer:

1 each of the 12 Madeiras
listed $220.50

The photograph shows clearly and dra-
matically the rugged, precipitous terrain
of mountainous Madeira. Here are three
vignerons carrying wine-filled goat skins
called borrachos from vineyard to wine
lodge. Because of the steepness, it is neces-
sary to press the grapes where they grow
and transport their juice, rather than the
fruit itself.

Rare, lrreplaceable

Vintage MADEIRA

Krom the Last Century

RARE 18th and 19th CENTURY
SOLERA MADEIRAS
Bottle

1748 VERDELHO SOLERA 29.75
The oldest Solera in existence anywhere in the world. A 220-year slum-
ber was interrupted when this cask was bottled. From the private col-
lection of Joao Alfredo Faria, an important landowner of Funchal.

1792 MALMSEY SOLERA 28.50
This is the very vintage that Napoleon Bonaparte took comfort in his
exile at Elba when his sailing vessel stopped at Madeira en route. From
the private collection of Joao Homem de Gouveia, a landowner in the
Madeira town of Porto Moniz.

1792 BOAL SOLERA 27.50
A rich, golden, almost dessert-like example of Madeira. The wine our
ancestors drank with terrapin and shad. From a private estate acquired
by Justino Henriques.

1822 GRABHAM’S VERDELHO SOLERA 24.75
Medium full, remarkable — James Monroe was President when this wine
was laid down.

1830 SERCIAL SOLERA 24.00
The driest of the grapes used to make Madeira is called Sercial. Similar
to a Fino Sherry but with a special bouquet and character of its own.
Here is a great example from the private reserve of Justino Henriques.
