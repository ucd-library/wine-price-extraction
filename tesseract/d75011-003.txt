 

Christmas Shopp

BLESSED ARE THOSE who love Christmas shop-
ping, for in our culture practically everybody has to
do it. And at SHERRY’S we attempt to make it a
pleasurable experience, even for those who consider
it something of a chore. If you would rather remain in
your armchair, you can still order your Christmas
gifts by using this catalog and perhaps, in browsing
through it, buy a well-deserved gift for yourself.

An even more joyous way would be for you to
simply drop in on us, wander among the largest selec-
tion of wines and spirits in New York, and pleasantly
talk over your needs in unhurried fashion with our
staff. Whether you are looking for a superlative bottle
of old Cognac for your not-too-easy to please uncle;
a bottle of 19th Century Madeira for an historically-
minded, contemplative friend; or a case of distin-
guished, moderately-priced Champagne for your own
New Year’s party, you will surely find it here.

We don’t pretend that things sometimes don’t get
a little hectic in those frenzied last-second days

before December 25th (so, try to come early — but
even then, we will be here to recommend, advise and
help. A gift from SHERRY’S will carry its own dis-
tinctive individuality, is always appreciated, whether
it be an interesting single bottle or a whole hearty
case. If your friends are hospitable, you may even
get a glass yourself, for wines and spirts are gifts

to enjoy, to celebrate with, to share with others.
