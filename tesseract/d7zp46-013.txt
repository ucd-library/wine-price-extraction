BRANDY DISCOVERIES —Heralding a Marc of Montrachet

FORTNUM & MASON’S FINE CHAMPAGNE COGNAC... ecennnnnnnn
This interesting example of dry, English Market Cognac is particularly relished by
Cognac connoisseurs. Great Britain is a nation that takes its Brandy very seriously.
Aware of this, the 250 Year Old firm of Fortnum & Mason have acquired some of
the best and oldest stocks of Cognac to meet the uncompromising demands of knowing

Londoners.

ee ROGGE, MONT RACH oe etree ttenerteteeren
From the grape pressings of Le Montrachet, the greatest white wine vineyards of all
Burgundy, comes this full-bodied, intriguing and remarkable Brandy. It is the proud
product of Julien Monnot, a small but distinguished grower, who owns some of the
best land in the Montrachet vineyard. Brandy of this type is normally distilled only
in the smallest of quantities for private use and is hard to come by. However, we
did manage to persuade M. Monnot to part with a few of his precious bottles—a rare
brandy that captures the essence of one of Burgundy ’s greatest vineyards.
