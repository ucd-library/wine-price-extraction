Boordy Red 1969
Boordy Dry White 1969

i.e es

We quote in part from a letter received from
the proprietor,Philip Wagner, who was editor
of the Baltimore-Sun until his recent retire-
ment. He now writes a syndicated column on
Public Affairs under a Washington dateline.
“After repeal, my wife, Jocelyn and I stum-
bled on the existence of a whole family of
French wine grapes, the hybrids—genetic
crosses made between some of the classic
wine varieties of European and certain
American species with a view to obtaining
wine grapes of European character, superim-
posed on the hardiness of the American spe-
cies. In order to share this discovery with
others, we established a nursery, in Maryland,
which has now grown to the point where we
propagate around 100,000 vines a year. This
resulted in more grapes than we could use
ourselves, so we established the notion of a
small winery, making good wine—and by ex-
tension, the hybrids could be transplanted to
other choice vineyard soil of the United
States, particularly Upper New York State.
Jocelyn and I did all the work ourselves in
the beginning—as others might raise cattle or
breed horses. For me, wine-growing was an
ideal foil for newspaper editing—a relaxing
and total switch from one side of problems
and way of thinking to another.

Before long, we found ourselves producing

the ‘vin du pays’ of the Baltimore-Washington
area, and, as you know, there has really not
been enough left over to allow us to ship it
elsewhere. We still carry on in much the same
way. Because of smallness, eventually sur-
vival of such a personal creation such as
Boordy Vineyard has to come up. The perfect
answer was a second Boordy Vineyard, which
we established in the favorable grape-growing
district that lies along the south shore of Lake
Erie. The wines from the Lake Erie area of
the 1969 vintage are being produced in suffi-
cient quantity to make them available to those
of your clientele who like the classic taste im-
parted by European hybrids.

Our own small and dedicated Maryland en-
terprise is being duplicated intact in Upper
New York State, and Jocelyn and I have the
last word on what goes into the bottle. The
‘RED 1969’ recalls some of the French Beau-
jolais—the ‘DRY WHITE 1969’ has the
freshness and fruit of a Muscadet and should
be drunk young—the ‘1969 ROSE’ is dis-
creetly fragrant, of soft vintage and without
a trace of sweetness (we think you will like it)
and the ‘BOORDYBLUMCHEN 1969’ is
reminiscent of those pleasant, fragrant bottles
of white wine that come from such pictur-
esque European valleys such as Loire, the
Rhine and the Danube.”

PRODUCED AND BOTTLED

   

 

 

Whether it be in France, Germany or California, a label must
conform to strictly enforced governmental regulations. It also
provides standards of excellence that the knowledgeable
wine consumer looks for.

In the instance of the INGLENOOK VINEYARD, the highest
standards prevailing in California are lived up to. Note the
following:

1. ESTATE-BOTTLED—This means that the grapes are grown
exclusively in the proprietor’s own vineyards and bottled at
the proprietor’s own winery. In Burgundy it is called ‘Estate-
bottled,’ and in Bordeaux it is called ‘Chateau-bottled.’

2. VINTAGE—The year in which the grapes were gathered
and the wine was put into barrel. It provides indication of age
and gives you clues as to nature of wine based on weather
conditions that are reported in wine literature.

— ESTATE BOTTLED

 

3. VARIETAL—In California, the ‘varietals’ represent the su-
perior grape varieties such as Gamay, Charbono or Traminer.
At least 51% of the wine must come from that particular va-
riety. In the instance of Inglenook varietals, over 90% come
from a superior grape ‘varietal’ indicated on label.

4. WINE GROWING DISTRICT—In France the districts are
Bordeaux, Burgundy, etc. In California there is Napa Valley,
Sonoma, Livermore, etc.—the best wine districts of America.
All of the Inglenook estate-bottlings come from Napa Valley.
5. PRODUCED & BOTTLED-—If a wine label reads ‘bottled
by,” the wine can come from any place. If it reads ‘‘Produced
and bottled by,” it means that the entire wine making process
took place on the premises. All Inglenook wines comply with
this requirement.

PLEASE TURN TO THE CENTER OF THIS BROCHURE
(PAGE 28A) you will find a full listing of the Inglenook estate-
bottled vintage wines, grown and bottled at their Napa Valley
vineyard. Here is a serious and dedicated attempt on the part
of an American vineyard to achieve the standard of high ex-
cellence associated with the world-renowned Chateaux and
estates of France and Germany—wines that can bring a sense
of pride to our native wine growing industry.

FOR THOSE who would like to experience outstanding red,
white and rosé wine from the Napa Valley vineyard of Ingle-
nook, we suggest you acquire the HALF-GALLON economy
size. All three types are truly excellent and they average out at
$1.50 the bottle for this large size (there is a further reduction
of 10% if you acquire a case of six half gallons for $20.25).
