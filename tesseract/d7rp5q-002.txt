Here is one of the best Pouilly Fuisses that I have ever tasted. Green gold and fragrant, with an altogether special freshness,

lightness and charm. I find, on looking over my tasting notes, that I gave it 1744 points out of a possible maximum of 20.

(It is also available in Magnums at $4.19 and in half boitles at $1.09 each, $24.65 the case.)

An extraordinary value and one of the greatest Meursaults of a great vintage. Monsieur Matrot is an old friend of mine and I
can say of his cellars what I can say of few cellars that I know. I have never found a bad wine in it, and here is one of his best.

Produced by Les Petits de J. Guenier
In the whole Chablis district, only seven tiny vineyards are entitled to the proud designation of GRAND PREMIER CRU, or
“great first growth.” “Clos” is one of the best of the seven. This pale green-gold, lovely wine of the excellent 1950 vintage is
everything a fine Chablis should be.

CHASSAGNE MONTRACHET, LES CAILLERETS; 1950. - . : 249- 2795
Estate Bottled, C. Ramonet

1950 I feel certain will eventually be classified as one of the greatest of all vintage years in white Burgundy. Its wines are
lighter than those of 1947 and 1949 and they have an almost supernatural finesse of bouquet and flavor. This Estate Bottled 1950
is an exciting preview of a magnificent year. (Also available in Magnums at $5.19.)

Shipped by Jacques Depagneux

Moulin-a-Vent takes its name from the ancient windmill that overlooks this most famous single vineyard of the Beaujolais
country. This 1949 is Beaujolais at its best: Incidentally, Monsieur Depagneux supplies most of the Beaujolais for the famous
restaurant La Pyramide (Point) at Vienne.

Estate Bottled, M. Doudet

The little town of Savigny-les-Beaune, in a fold of the hills between Beaune and Corton, produces what are perhaps the pleas-
antest medium priced Burgundies of the whole Cote d’Or. This 1949, fine, not too heavy and now ready, is an exceptional

wine of its class.

CHASSAGNE MONTRACHET, CLOS ST, JEAN 1947.5... . 2 © 199 ° 22.85

Estate Botiled, C. Ramonet

Most of the famous wines of Chassagne Montrachet are white, but two or three vineyards are planted with Pinot Noir grapes
and yield red Burgundies of unusual character and charm. Among the producers of these wines, Ramonet is perhaps the best,
and this, his finest 1947, is an unqualified success.

Estate Bottled, M. Doudet

The picturesque and sleepy old city of Beaune is the wine capital of Burgundy. The wines (most of them red) that come from
its vine covered hillside, are soft and gracious with fine texture. 1947 of course, was a very great year indeed and the Clos du
Roi is one of Beaune’s best vineyards.
