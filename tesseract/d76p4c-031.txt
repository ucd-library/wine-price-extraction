 

JOYOUS WINES OF ITALY

We now turn to Italy—where a zestful, sensuous cuisine is com-
plemented perfectly by a profusion of excellent red and white wines.
One of the delights of drinking Italian wine is that, although the quality
of the wine exported to America has increased dramatically over the
past ten years, the prices have remained relatively low.

Sherry-Lehmann’s list of Italian wines is the largest and the best we
have ever been able to offer. Many of our customers already know the
delights of Italian wine—and we hope to persuade more and more to
sample the wonderful drinking—at low, low cost—that these joyous
wines provide.

The MOST REMARKABLE
and OLDEST BOURBON
Produced During this Generation!

Our fathers often tell us of the ex-
cellence and virtues of the Pre-
Prohibition Bourbons of their
youth. We recently conducted a
blind tasting, matching the “20
Year Old Collector’s Item” against
two whiskies that were distilled in
1913 and Sottied in 1933. [co
everyone's surprise, the ‘Col-
lector’s Item’ was chosen as the
better. If you have friends or
relatives that truly appreciate rare
old bourbon, now is the time to ac-
quire your supply for your
Christmas needs—because the
probability is that our limited inven-
tory will be exhausted before the
end of the year.
