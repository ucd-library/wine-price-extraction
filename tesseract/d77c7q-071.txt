The recent TIME-LIFE book “Wines & Spirits” states, “In
1962 red Burgundies are not simply good, but can be con-
sidered great. Red Burgundies ideally suited for present
drinking.”

628 AUXEY DURESSES LE VAL......

Estate-bottled, Rene Roy.

A sleeper—because the wines of this town are not as well-
known as their more famous neighbors, you benefit by being
able to get truly outstanding wine at relatively low cost.

177 POMMARD PLATIERE ..........
Estate-bottled, Prince de Merode.

Much of the wine that bears the easy-to-remember name of
Pommard must be delicious, since ten times as much is sold
around the world than is produced. We are dealing here with
a genuine, estate-bottled example of great class and the well-
balanced qualities associated with superb Pommard.

644 VOSNE ROMANEE, SUCHOTS...
Estate-bottled, H. Lamarche.

An outstanding ‘big league’ thoroughbred from some of the
choicest soil of Vosne-Romanée, considered the best wine-
growing town of all Burgundy.

495 00 TACHE,.....:.:22.57 55. ee 24.50 264.60

Estate-bottled, Domaine de la Romanée-Conti.

When this wine is tasted, the lover of great Burgundy ex-
claims “This is Burgundy in all its greatness, velvetiness,
and super natural finesse.”

Again we quote from the TIME-LIFE book “Wines & Spirits,”
“The production in 1961 was half of normal and the wines
are of exceptional quality and longevity. The better vine-
yards will still be great 20 years from now.”

384 NUITS-ST. GEORGES........... 3.99 43.10
Deep, well-rounded, much flavor and pronounced bouquet.
For drinking now. From the cellars of Nicolas.

404 VOSNE-ROMANEE ............. 4.99 53.90
Within the communal limits of Vosne-Romanée, you can dis-
cover such unmatchable red wines as Romanée-Conti, Riche-
bourg, La Tache and La Romanée. In the same small area,
but without such heralded names, superb wine is grown—
especially during the outstanding 1961 vintage. Were we to
charge $7.00 for this wine, would it be worth it? The answer
is—yes, beyond question. From the cellars of Nicolas.

165 BONNES MARES ............... 6.99 75.50
Here we can observe finesse and delicacy combined beauti-
fully with robustness and depth of flavor. From the cellars
of Nicolas.

355 CHARMES CHAMBERTIN .......
Estate-bottled, Tortochot.

Our friend, Morton May of St. Louis, considers Tortochot
among the best makers of wine in the town of Gevrey-
Chambertin. His opinion is based on a decade of experience.
We are inclined to agree with him.

The Burgundian cellars are denuded of their ’59s. Were it
not for our close relation to our loyal friends in Burgundy,
not even an exhibitionist display of money would have in-
duced them to part with any of these rare treasures. They
are not simply good, but dramatically great for present
drinking, exhibiting great charm, warmth, balance and deli-
cacy. We are not urging you to lay these wines down in your
cellar, but to drink them reverently during the next two or
three years, while they remain at their dramatic heights.

615: > POMIMIARD eee be see oo

Estate-bottled, Gaunoux.

An amazing wine. Rich in fruit and power, with all traces of
tannin gone.

668 -BEAUNE. GREVES ... 2... 6.49 70.10
Beaune is the wine capital of Burgundy and it is surrounded
by 1,350 acres of its own hillside vineyards. The generation-
after-generation natives speak reverently of their best vine-
yard, “Les Greves.” Here is a wine, remarkable for its bal-
ance, grace and elegance. And it was Joseph Drouhin him-
self, the dean of Beaune, who has nurtured this particular
wine from its birth until its shipment to the United States
in 1969.

740, .VOSNE-ROMANEE -s sei o04 ace 6.79 73.35
Here again, we are dealing with Joseph Drouhin, who has
cared for this wine from the beginning. Look for breed, ele-
gance, exceptional balance and fine bouquet.

661 CHAMBOLLE-MUSIGNY ........ 6.99 75.50
The town of Chambolle-Musigny is proud of their two best
vineyards ‘Musigny’ and ‘Bonnes Mares.’ Robert Drouhin,
when speaking of this wine of which he waxes poetic, states,
‘Do not look for body, but look for finesse—which you will
find in unique abundance.”

696 POMMARD EPENOTS...........
Estate-bottled, Gaunoux.

Look for softness, a special gracious quality, fine balance
and an abundance of fruit. Here we are contending with the
best single vineyard of the town of Pommard.

724 CLOS DES LAMBRAYS: -.i..23..
Estate-bottled, Cosson.

The heaviest, fullest bodied and most long-lived single red
wine of the Cote d’Or. You can drink it now or ten years
hence.

567. CHAMBERTIN, CLOS DE BEZE... 12.50 135.00
To obtain Clos de Beze of 1966 is a unique accomplishment.
To achieve any of the 1959 vintage represents a minor wine
miracle. From the cellars of Paul Bouchard.

427 RICHEBOURG 29.75 —
This great, great rarity reached us only recently—and it came
from the private personal reserves of the Domaine de la
Romanée-Conti. It cost us a king’s ransom, but it is worth it
to those who want to achieve one of the most remarkable
wine tasting experiences of their life time. Because of limited
quantity, we are offering it only by the bottle to make it
available to a maximum number of wine aficionados.

499 LA TAGHE oes 32.95 —
Estate-bottled, Domaine de la Romanée-Conti.

We own only 40 bottles and we limit our offering to a maxi-
six bottles to each adventuresome wine lover.
