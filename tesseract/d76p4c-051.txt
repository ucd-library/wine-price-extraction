 

You get 12 outstandingly fine

wines of Italy—6 RUBESCO RED 1973 (on the same exalted
level as a fine Chianti Riserva or Barolo) and 6 TORRE DI
GIANO 1976 (an elegant, bone-dry white of greater com-
plexity than Soave or Verdicchio). In addition you receive a
handsome wooden wine rack (easily assembled in only
three minutes) that long after its contents have been joy-
ously consumed, will add beauty and utility to your home.
(There is no extra charge for the wine rack.) Makes a hand-

some gift for the holidays.

OLD RARITY IS NO ORDINARY
42-YEAR-OLD SCOTCH. Its heri-
tage is supreme and second to
none. It is the proud, aged distil-
late of the century-old Bulloch
Lade Ltd. of Glasgow, Scotland
—where it is distilled, happily
blended from 28 different whis-
kies, and bottled. It wins en-
thusiastic applause among whisky fanciers of London and
Edinburgh—and soon it will be a rage in New York, joining
the happy company of Ballantine’s 12, Chivas Regal,
Johnny Walker Black, Ambassador Royal, Dewar’s
Ancestor, Grant’s Royal and Haig Pinch. An economical
choice among the premium Scotch Christmas gifts.
