THE GREAT SECOND GROWTHS OF THE 1975 VINTAGE

continued Price per Case

If Acquired Now

CHATEAU FIGEAC (St. Emilion) 89.50
If you like Chateau Cheval Blanc, and are not prepared to pay $194 the case,

Chateau Figeac would be the ideal alternative. Why? The vineyard is adjacent

to Cheval Blanc and produces a glorious wine that is quite its equal in depth,

distinction, and longevity.

CHATEAU LYNCH BAGES (Pauillac) 89.50
Rich, full - almost achieves the depth, richness and weight of its neighbor Mouton
Rothschild. A wine designed for those who like power.

CHATEAU TROTANOY (Pomerol) 99 .00
Less than 3000 cases of this great Pomerol are produced a year. A true glory - in

the grand tradition of Chateau Petrus which means mouth-filling, big, vigorous,

and dramatic.

CHATEAU PALMER (Margaux) 99 .50
Outside of the great First Growths, Chateau Palmer consistently fetches the highest

price for its wine than any other vineyard of the Medoc. Adjacent to Chateau

Margaux, it is endowed with similar characterisitcs. Fine, full, great class and

finesse - brilliant future.

CHATEAU LA MISSION HAUT BRION (Graves) 129.50
Distinguishing characterisitcs of balance and finesse. This 1975 will continue to
grow for another two decades.

 

d Sam Aaron, there are several chateaux in Bordeaux that have shown so much merit during recent

cades, that they are worthy of being considered equals of the Fourth and Fifth Growths of the original

55 classification. Here are several that are truly outstanding - wines of longevity that will flourish

ring the years ahead, and are economically advantageous to acquire at this point in their history -
fore the wine lovers of the world become alerted to their intrinsic merit.

CHATEAU ANGLUDET (Margaux) 25°95
Light, supple, engaging. The proud property of the Sichel family. Promises a
brilliant future.

CHATEAU PHELAN SEGUR (St. Estephe) 56.00
Exhibits the richness, tannin, depth and longevity typically associated with St. Estephe.

CHATEAU CLINET (Pomerol) 67.50
The good Pomerol vineyards, in the tradition of Petrus, produce very full-bodied

wines, of splendid nose, and with a gleaming dark ruby color. Only 17 acres

and less than 3000 cases for the world.

CHATEAU GLORIA (St. Julien) 67.95
Here we must pause. In our opinion, this is possibly the best value in our 1975
offering, becasue true greatness is combined with the liveable price of $69.95
the case. It is Chateau Gloria that was immortalized recently by Robert Daley

in the feature article that appeared in the Sunday New York Times Magazine.
The wine that Henri Martin, President of the Bordeaux Wine Growers Association,
produced at Gloria in 1975 is truly great and will develop for at least another
decade. Because of world demand, it is possibly the most difficult of all of the
vineyards of the Medoc to acquire, so we suggest ordering promptly. For those
who share with us the belief in the future greatness of Chateau Gloria 1975, we
make a SPECIAL OFFER of $65 the case to the foresighted who order six cases

at one time to be delivered to one address. Many wise wine-lovers are taking
advantage of this unique offer.

PREMIAT CABERNET SAUVIGNON (Romania) 1.99 Zao
In Romania a wine must be made of 90% Cabernet Sauvignon grape to

earn the name. We approached this wine skeptically because of the

price - until we tasted it! Possibly the best value in red wine anywhere

in the United States. Be experimental - don't let the low price discourage

you. You will like it.

COTES DU RHONE ROUGE 1975, La Vieille Ferme (Rhone) 2.49 28.40
The better red wines of the Cotes du Rhone have gone up over 30% at

the vineyards because of world recognition of their excellence. This

one will be forced up to $2.99 by the fall. If this is one of your

favorites, we suggest you anticipate your future requirements now.

CHATEAU DE RAULY 1972 (Bergerac Blanc) Loe 34.10
Grown 80 miles east of Bordeaux straddling the Dordogne River. Estate-
bottled, medium dry white. Interesting - and well worth acquiring.

SAUMUR CHAMPIGNY ROUGE 1973, Fillatreau (Loire) Leos, 34.10
A glorious red from the Loire - the favorite of Clemenceau. Rich in
fruit, wonderful bouquet, utterly charming - ready now.

GIGONDAS 1971, Chateau Raspail (Rhone) Sooy AS) 0
The wonderful Rhone red grown northeast of Avignon. Full-bodied
but soft - similar to a good Chateauneuf-du-Pape

In the grand, rich, luxurious Sauternes tradition of Yquem - but only
at a_ fraction of the price. Worth double the price

OUTSTANDING RHINES AND MOSELLES
PRODUCED DURING THE GREAT, GREAT 1975 VINTAGE

1975 is undoubtedly one of the best vintages in recent German wine-growing history. It is in the
great tradition of 1953, 1959 and 1971. Richness, fine fruit and balance are the distinguishing
characteristics. These wonderful '75s come along at the precise time when the highly praised '71s
have more or less disappeared from the market. In balance, the '75s at least equal - or more likely
surpass - the excellence of the '7ls. The prices are marching upward astonishingly, so we suggest

you acquire your spring and summer needs now. Each of the wines listed here is a beauty.

The most famous wine-producing village

671 BERNKASTELER KURFURSTLAY, W. Dunweg 3427 37.55
Bernkastel is a fairytale village of gingerbread houses with geraniums
hanging from every window. The wine is light, wonderfully dry and
fragrant, and endowed with a subtle bouquet.

674 OCKFENER GEISBERG KABINETT, F. Wilhelm Gymnasium 4,29 48 .95
In the Saar Valley there is the 200-acre Ockfen slope that produces
some of the steeliest, most elegant and fragrant wines in the world.
This is particularly true in great years such as 1971 and 1975. Would

be a bargain at double the price.

679 JOSEPHS HOFER KABINETT, Count von Kesselstatt Ay, 54.65
Josephshof is the great vineyard of Graach, owned in its entirety for
over a century by the Kesselstatt family. Rich, full-bodied, dramatic.

The excellence of the vineyard and vintage are beyond dispute. The
Freidrich Wilhelm Gymnasium is a famous secondary school in Trier

on the Mosetle. Their stamp on a Moselle label has become synonomous
with outstanding excellence.

687 SCHARZHOFBERGER KABINETT, Egon Muller S97 68.30
We quote Frank Schoonmaker, "few wine names are accorded such
unhesitating respect by wine-lovers - this is no more than fair for
there are few wines as remarkable as a Scharzhofberger of a great
year - light, but with great depth of flavor - austere but with fragrance
- the great Scharzhofbergers are not far from perfection. !

688 SCHARZHOFBERGER SPATLESE, Egon Muller Toy, VAL AG,
From the same noble origin as the Scharzhofberger described above,
but this one is a Spatlese, or late picking. This simply means an even
more rich and concentrated wine. Sheer drama on the palate,

724 ELTVILLER SONNENBERG, Langwerth von Simmern 3.69 42.10

The Eltvillers never achieve true greatness, but are consistenly good
and sound. Sonnenberg is its best vineyard - and 1975 is indisputable
as a vintage.

728 STEINBERGER KABINETT, German State Domaine So77 45.50
A 12th century vineyard created by monks of the Cistercian Order. It
was taken over by the State of Hessia and is now part of the German

The castle, with its keep, dates back to 1355. The simplest and
driest wine of the schloss has a green capsule and bears the name
Grunlack. You will find it light, elegant, and pleasing.
