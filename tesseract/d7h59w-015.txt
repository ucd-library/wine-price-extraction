France, one must look to Burgundy. We
herald the arrival of the young, fresh 1962s
and wax lyrical about the truly fabulous
1961s. True to type, beautifully balanced
with great finesse, they are destined to be
long-lived—at last white Burgundies that

390 MUSIGNY BLANC .. .42.50 137.50
Estate bottled, Comte de Vogue

There are those who claim that this is the greatest white Burgundy made. But
one thing is certain, we are aware that it is the most expensive white wine of
the Cote d’Or. lis production is ridiculously smal] and the world demand is at
least twenty times the supply. Its characteristics are great power, mouth-filling
flavor, pronounced bouquet, and a wonderful aftertaste. Quantity limited. The
1962 is absolutely magnificent.

*326 MEURSAULT ..... 299 32.95
Estate bottled, Ampeau

The white wines of Meursault are only a shade less distinctive than Corton
Charlemagne and Montrachet. The distinguishing characteristics are dry, deli-
cate and with much perfume. Here is a good one.

318 CHABLIS, MONTEE DE

We visited Mr. Servin in 1950 and have been devoted followers of his wonder-
ful Chablis ever since,

*335 MEURSAULT CHARMES . 3.79 41.75

Estate bottled, Ampeau

From one of the most magnificent vineyards of Meursault. Good breed, good
texture, just coming into its own. Long life ahead.

Estate bottled, A. Grivault

Les perrieres is the best vineyard and heart of Meursault. It is the center, or
bull’s eye, a tiny plot bearing the name. ‘‘Clos des Perrieres.” The Grivault
family gets as much for this wine as for Montrachet—it is worth it.

*351 BATARD MONTRACHET . 4.99 54.95
Estate bottled, C. Ramonet

Only a tiny lane separates this from “le Montrachet’’ itself. We were told in
Burgundy that the quality of the wine produced here, and the reputation of the
name, has made the land worth over $30,000 the acre—just as real estate.

*350 CORTON CHARLEMAGNE 3.49 60.50
Estate bottled, Dubreuil-Fontaine

Produced on the steepest hillside of Burgundy, this 1961 is remarkable in its
dramatic taste qualities. Promises many years of greatness.

686 MONTRACHET .... 8.50 93.50
Estate bottled, Milan-Mathey

The tiny bit of soil called Le Montrachet produces what many believe to be
the greatest white wine on earth. The total area averages 1200 casea divided
amos 16 Fama Since much of it is sold to friends, little remains for the rest
of the world.

*Half bottles available at $3 per case additional.
