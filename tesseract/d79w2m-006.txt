CHATEAU LEOVILLE LASCASES (St. Julien) ......................
'66 promises to achieve the high level of Leoville's remarkable |
1959. '67—soft, fruity.

CHAEESY BINGE BaGho (Paiilac).
Rich, full; almost has the weight of Mouton Rothschild.

CHATEAU PICHON LONGUEVILLE LALANDE (Pauillac) ee
Good color and bouquet. Fine balance. Similar to its neighbor

Chateau Latour, in weight, depth and longevity. '67—outstanding
success.

CHATEAU BEYCHEVELLE (St. poe
Finesse is the distinguishing characteristic in both years.

CHATEAU COS D'ESTOURNEL (St. Betepae
'66 has deep color; big strong wine—'67 heavier than ‘66 in

most vineyards.

CHATEAU LASCOMBES (MAY EBOR)
Outstanding color and finesse. Shows the typical subtlety of
Margaux's bouquet.

CHATEAU CLOS FOURTET (St. PME LUON)
Grand Premier Cru St. Emilion. Almost up to Cheval Blanc itself in depth.
CaAete Teno, (Mer eenk) (ee
Good fruit and finish, extraordinary breed. The '66 will compete

with First Growths.

CHATEAU LATOUR-A-POMEROL (POMOPOL) 0 ee
Big, soft, can be enjoyed almost immediately after bottling.

CHATEAU LATOUR HAUT BRION (Graves) (5 =o
Similar characteristics to La Mission Haut Brion listed below. Same
proprietor.

CHATEAU LA MISSION HAUT BRION (EPaves)-
Splendid color, big, round, fine bouquet and finesse.

CHE EA MARGAUR ((Warea) ie ee
Bouquet, color, fruit, in balance, Showing well when tasted from cask.
CHATEAU PETRUS ([POMOP OI) uo ge
Only 16 acres. Hard to come by. Well-rounded and fruity;

outstandingly velvety.

CHATEAU LATOUR (Pautliae) Joc ee
Full-bodied; firm, exceptional breed; both '66 and '67 will

obviously live for many more decades.

CHATEAU HAUT BRION (GTaves) 2 2
Very big, full; power combined with elegance. Possibly the greatest
Single red wine produced in Bordeaux during the 1966 vintage—

'67 not as big but ready much sooner.

CHATEAU AUSONE obs Be bien oo
Less robust than Cheval Blanc; Supreme finesse. Only 17 acres

compared to Cheval Blanc's 87; therefore harder to come Dy,

CHATEAU CHEVAL BLANC (St. MBL iten 2. 6
Competes with Haut Brion and Latour in strength. Deep color,
relatively soft, good fruit.

CHATEAU MOUTON ROTHSCHILD (Pauti ae ee
Big, powerful, robust slow to mature, long-lived. Frank Schoonmaker
States "Mouton is best of the '67s".

CHATEAU LAFITE ROTHSCHILD (PAs aG ye
Price astonish you? Cost almost this 'while still in barrel' in
Bordeaux today. Very rare. Will be over $200.00 the case before

too much time goes by. A true classic.
