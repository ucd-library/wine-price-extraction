We spent many days in the cellars of the small Burgundy proprietors dur-
ing the Spring of 1956, tasting wine after wine, to make certain that the
1955 wines we would ultimately offer would be beyond reproach. In our
opinion, many of the great treasures of Burgundy are included in the

list below.

Here are wines in the classic tradition, beautifully balanced, and ideally
suited for laying down. Because of the unsatisfactory quality, generally,
of both the 1954 and 1956 among the red Burgundies, followed by the
frost damage of 1957, we think it particularly advantageous to acquire

these scarce estate-bottlings.

RED WINES |
254 CHATEAU PICHON LONGUEVILLE
1953

A Chateau bottled Pauillac of exceptional depth and |
subtlety.

235 CHATEAU PALMER 1953

Remarkable balance, unique finesse. From Margaux.

256 CHATEAU LYNCH BAGES 1953

An amazing wine. Quite in the class with the Firs
Growths that sell for almost double the price.

388 CHATEAU MONTHELIE, 1953

Our visit to Burgundy yielded this treasure — a superb

  

oo

vineyard adjacent to Pommard — would sell for 50%
more were it offered under the more popular name
Pommard.

220 CHATEAU LEOVILLE LASCASES
1949

Only 18 cases of this outstanding 1949 St. Julien remain.

246 CHATEAU GAFFELIERE-NAUDES,
1953

Hard to pronounce — in St. Emilion it is ranked only
slightly below Cheval Blanc and Ausone. A noble
claret, ready now, worth very much more.

WHITE WINES
275 CHATEAU LATOUR BLANCHE 1949

Second only to Chateau d’Yquem itself in reputation and
richness of flavor. Normally sells for over $4.00.

342 PULIGNY MONTRACHET 1955
Estate Bottled, J. Bavard

An estate bottled dry white Burgundy from one of the best
growers of the Puligny Montrachet area.

323 POUILLY FUISSE, BEAUREGARD,
1955 Estate Bottled, Burrier

The best wines of Pouilly-Fuisse have the dryness and
austerity associated only with top flight white Burgundy.
Here is a prime example from a prime grower.
