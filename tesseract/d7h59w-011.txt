380 MUSCADET, CLOS MOUELLES, 1962 (Cassard) 41.49 16.50

Delicate, fresh, dry white wine of Loire—at best when young—excellent estate bottling.

904 MUSCADET-SUR-LIE 1963 (Barre). . . . - 31.99 21.95

Join the “Vin de l'Annee” Club. Enjoy the disarming engaging virtues of Muscadet within 6 months of the
vintage. This wine was bottled from the original barrel, right off the lees, without going through a racking and
fining. It’s more expensive to do it this way, only the best wine can be used, but it is worth the effort and you
will Ee enjoying the best Muscadet you ever tasted, the proud product of a so called “‘off year’.

«397 VOUVRAY RESERVE 1962 (Monmousseau). . 41.99 214.95

In Tours, only 10 miles from where this wine is grown, they cry, ‘‘ouvrez le Vouvray”. They generally demand a
young one, and from Monmousseau, the most important grower of them all. And there are half bottles. too.

474 SANCERRE 1962 (Cabit) . . . ..... 1.99 21.95

Like Pouilly Fume, just across the river, Sancerre produces a dry white wine of captivating delicacy.

«495 POUILLY BLANC FUME 1960 (Lebrun). . . 1.99 21.95

Only 60 cases and then no more! This wine normally commands $2.95—the 1960 is excellent—Lebroun is a top
flight estate bottler. Buy your spring needs now—and there are the handy half bottles too.

488 ANJOU BLANC 1962 (Chateau dela Fresnaye). . 2-49 27.50

Creighton Churchill, the author of an excellent book on the wines of France, has waxed poetic about this Loire
vineyard. It has just reached us and we recognize that we are contending with a Montrachet of the Loire. Rich,
full, elegant, slightly sweet, it is a wine of character, interest, and exceptional elegance.

«468 CHATEAU D'AIGUEVILLE 1961... .. 41-49 16.50

There is a plentitude of good red wine in the Rhone and much of it moves North to the Cote d’Or to round out
some of the Burgundy blends. Some of the good ones remain behind, are bottled under their own names, and
ae an important contribution to everyday drinking of good red wine at low cost. Don’t forget about the
half bottles.’

«381 CHATEAUNEUF DU PAPE 1960 (Felibres). . 91.99 21.95

The Rhone play topsy-turvey with the Vintage Charts. Unlike Burgundy, the 1959’s did not fare too well but
the 1960’s were full bodied, round, soft, and are maturing well indeed. A “find” for those who will ignore
the usual Vintage Chart.

420 CHATEAUNEUF DU PAPE 1955 (Felibres). . 2-429 30.75

It has often been said that a good, fully matured Chateau Neuf du Pape can compete with a noble vineyard of
the Cote d’Or—and at half the price. If this be true, we know of no wine that can uphold this claim more effec-

tively than this 1955.
409 CHATEAUNEUF-DU-PAPE (Abeille) 1952. . 2.99 32.95

Alive, vibrant, great depth with no trace of its long ten years in the bottle. Remarkable. Worth double the price.

*478 NEUCHATEL 1962 (Villede Neuchatel). . . . 41.89 20.95

There will be practically no 1963 Neuchatel because of frost damage—so the 1962’s have gone up 50%. We are
holding the price line down, and offer you this delicate, dry Swiss wine below $2.00—no mean accomplishment
in light of present replacement cost.

375 FENDANT SPATLESE 1962 (Bishop de Sion). . 1.99 21.95

Skiers, mountain climbers, and tourists return from Switzerland and proclaim the virtues of the wines they
have experienced. None is fresher, crisper, and of more character than this one—from vineyards that have
been in the hands of the Church for centuries.

*670 SYLVANER 1962 (J. Willmann). . .... 1.49 16.50

If you ask for the best carafe wine in the Inns of Alsace, this is the very one they will be likely to give you.
