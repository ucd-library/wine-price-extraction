A great year. The 1985s are relatively rich and soft, exhibiting
depth and full flavor. There is also sufficient acidity to maintain
good equilibrium. These nuggets are starting to become
scarce.

he tale of the historic Veuve Clicquot
Champagne is an exciting one. The firm was
founded in 1772, then La Veuve Clicquot (the
widow Clicquot), inherited the reins of leadership from

her deceased husband in 1805.

She was a remarkable woman. Determined never to
compromise on quality in any phase of Champagne-
making, she soon was producing the best Champagne in
the region. In a Europe suffering from the Napoleonic
wars, she dispatched her agents to foreign lands to gain
the respect of a growing following of distinguished
clients—among them royalty. She meanwhile supervised
the cellars, bought some of the area’s best vineyard soil, Spectator blind tasting.
