One of the noblest of the world’s great wines is un-
doubtedly Vintage Port that has achieved most of its
maturation, like fine still wine, in bottle rather than
in cask. Here is one of the great collections in the
world — bottles that have moved from some of the
best cellars in Oporto, such as Da Silva, Rochas and
Hoopers, to our cellars in New York. These have cus-
tomarily been served to honored guests of these
Oporto firms who are asked the date of their birth,

anniversary, or any other significant event in their

lives — and a Port of that year is served.

This Christmas, in a personal way, you can follow the
same thoughtful practice. We suggest sending, as an
imaginative Christmas gift — Vintage Port — symbol-
ically bearing on its label ‘‘the year of significance”

in the life of the recipient.

If you have not yet experienced the pleasurable wine-
drinking joy of port that bears the date of its origin
on its label, we strongly advise that you acquire some

~ hot only for gifts — but for your own drinking
delight,
