TOWN HALL—MOLSHEIM Alsace

Choose from Among GREAT 1959
RHINES & MOSELLES |

“When we discuss the 1959 vintage on the Rhine and the Moselle, we are
dealing with an exceedingly great year, certainly unsurpassed since the last
war and in many ways comparable to 1921... their average quality is amaz-
ingly high—though some of the commoner ones might prove flat and dull, being
too low in acid—the estate bottlings from the dryest to the sweetest have great
ripeness and fruit. Truly, on the whole, a “vintage of the century,” states Frank
Schoonmaker, author of the definitive volume “The Wines of Germany.”
