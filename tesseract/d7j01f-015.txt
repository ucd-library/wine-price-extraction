Estate bottled, Furst von Metternich q
From the most majestic vineyard of them all. Normally ;
imported to sell cs well over $3.00 the bottle, this amaz- i ‘ e |
nannis ingly low price has been made possible only by a major : r
purchase on our part. Ideal for those who like a light, dry :

table wine of interest and character. We suggest early

 

acquisition because Schloss Johannisberg, at this fantas- _
tically low price, will be depleted rapidly. Acquire a case or
two for your Spring needs now.

588 SCHLOSS JOHANNISBERG GRUNLACK 1958... 2.79 31.50
Estate bottled, Furst von Metternich :

At this Schloss, the ‘Grunlack’ or ‘Green Seal,’ denotes one
step higher up in the scale of quality. Fuller in body, addi-
tional fruitiness, and a more pronounced bouquet. A fine
1958 of class that deserves to sell, normally, for over $4.00
the bottle.
