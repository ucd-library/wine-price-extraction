Dead Lucre: burnt Ambition:
Wine is best.

HILAIRE BELLOC,
Heroic Poem in Praise of Wine

@ Like most love stories, mine will
mean something to lovers; rather
less to those merely capable of love;
to the incapable, nothing. And, since
no love affair’s wild heart lets itself
be netted in words, this chronicle of
a passion may fail of effect. Yet
what lover, telling his tale, has ever
been put off bythe thought of failure?

In successful love affairs the most
radiant moment often occurs at the
Outset. Consummation, repetition,
recollection: each diffuses its ap-
propriate delight. Incomparable,
however, is the moment when, all
innocent of experience, knowledge
and judgment, one for the first time
meets the object of a future passion
and feels chosen, marked, almost
fated. The narrator in Conrad’s
Youth, sailing at dawn, in stillness
and exaltation, through the gateway
of the fabled East; the boy Napoleon
leading his troops in play battle on
the Corsican uplands, feeling in his
bones the electric shock: “I am a
soldier!”; the awkward beginning
angler or duck shooter with his very
first cast or shot sensing, amazed,
his future vocation—all, long before
achieving success or even skill, vi-
brate to their joyful destiny. Any
knowledge is good. But the most
exquisite knowledge flows from the
sudden insight that you are by a
quirk of nature fashioned to acquire
still greater knowledge.

Paris in 1927: of all places on the
earth’s varied crust the best place in
which to try one’s first bottle of wine.
[ was twenty-three. My wife had
by a few weeks preceded me there
so that when I arrived she was al-
ready wearing the city like a glove.
We met at noon of a brilliant August

 

PARTY OF ONE
Brief history of a love affair: when the passion is wine, both

the loved one and the lover improve with age

day, a-day like a pearl. We had little
money but much youth. For our
lunch my wife, shrewdly deciding to
start me off modestly, chose the Bon
Marché, the Macy’s of the Left
Bank. She could have saved her
pains: I was in Paris: a department
store was Aladdin’s palace. Was the
lunchroom on the fourth floor? Or
in Heaven? I have forgotten.

With our lunch my wife, already
to me formidably learned in these
matters, ordered a cheap white
Graves. Its deep straw color was
pleasing to the eye. Even in this
busy department store it was served
with just a graceful allusion to a
flourish. It was properly chilled
against the midsummer heat. For
the first time I tasted wine. It must
have sent me into a mild catatonia
for it was not until perhaps sixty
seconds later that I seemed to hear
my wife’s voice say from far away,
**You have the most peculiar, foolish
smile on your face.”’ “‘Do I?’ was
all I could reply. We may know we
are happy when we do not know we
are smiling.

And so the die was cast. I felt not
so much that here was a new experi-
ence as that here was an old experi-
ence that had been waiting all my
life for me to catch up with it. It
was almost enough to make one
credit Plato’s crazy doctrine of remi-
niscence.

When one is young and has little
money it is prudent to spend that
little on the unnecessary, the emo-
tional dividends being higher. We
stayed six weeks in Paris and a large
part of our budget went on wine
that, I am proud to say, we could
not afford.

By the time I had finished my
tenth bottle in Paris and could tell
claret from Burgundy without glanc-
ing at the bottle’s shoulder slope, I

had grasped a fundamental fact:
that the pleasures of wine, being
both sensory and intellectual, are
profound. There are few pleasures
of which this can be said.

The appeal to the senses may be
simple; one can toss off a glass of a
vin de carafe with mild pleasure, and
so an end. But it need not be: there
is wine available (nor should one
drink too much of it) proffering a
whole world of complex stimuli in-
volving taste, color and fragrance.
Add to this the fact that one tastes
a wine in several ways, all involved
in a single swallow, for this swallow
leads a triple life: one in the mouth,
another in slipping down the gullet,
still another, a beautiful ghost, the
moment afterward.

This much I learned quickly. Nor
have I ever tired of learning it again
and again. The sensory satisfactions
of wine, varying with each sip, each
bottle, each occasion, are so ramified
that boredom is impossible. I know
that T. E. Lawrence, hardly a well-
balanced type, despised wine be-
cause he felt its gratifications were
too simple. He preferred to dis-
criminate, he declared, among va-
rieties of water. For such refine-
ments I lack the necessary sophisti-
cation, or perhaps merely the neces-
Sary puritanism. Water and milk
may be excellent drinks, but their
charms are repetitive. God granted
them swallowability, and rested.

Oenophile Fadiman judges some vinous
beauties acquired at Sherry Wine &
Spirits, his New York wine merchants.
