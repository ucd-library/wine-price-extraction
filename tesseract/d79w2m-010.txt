1959 BURGUN DIES

Scarce, Great-Derfection for Present Drinking

The vintage chart in the Time-Life book “Wines and
Spirits’ speaks briefly about the 1959 among the red
Burgundies -but pointedly. We quote “1959—if you seek
great red Burgundy vibrantly alive with fruit and charm,
drink the ’59s for the next few years”. We do not ask you

to lay the 59 Burgundies down for your grandchildren—
but if you want to experience the highest taste expres-
sion of what the red wines of Burgundy can achieve, any
one of the rare, irreplaceable thoroughbreds listed below
can bestow this wine-drinking pleasure upon you.

The better vineyards of Beaune are characterized b
relatively quick to mature. Here is perha
glory in 1959.

Confrerie des Chevaliers du Tastevin

Here we are dealing with a great Burgundy that was cared for throughout its life by M. Trinquet, the most respected
wine-maker of Burgundy, a reputation which he has earned by virtue of heading the School of Oenology of Beaune for
over 30 years. This wine proudly bears the numbered label of the Confrerie des Chevaliers du Tastevin and the en-
thusiastic approval of the ‘‘Tastevin”’ Tasting Committee.

Some wine-writers have suggested that the wines of “Grands Echezeaux” have never commanded the price and the
acclaim of neighboring vineyards which are no better largely because the name is difficult to pronounce and remem-
ber. Learn how to pronounce it, it’s easy (Esh-shay-zo); drink great wine and simultaneously save money.

Firm; fuller in body than most red Burgundies. Rich in fruit. Exceptional velvety qualities. Will thrive for at least
another 5 years.

Here again, we quote from the tasting notes of M. Trinquet, the retired Dean of the Vinicultural School of Beaune,
“Delicate perfume coupled with great richness. A most agreeable taste: full depth coupled with fine texture”.

This vineyard whose name means “‘the good acres”, is a “‘téte du cuvée”, or first growth, of Chambolle-Musigny. Not
as well known as its adjoining neighbor, Le Musigny, it commands a price well below its true value—one of the
noblest vineyards of all Burgundy.

What neighbors! Richebourg is bounded on the south by Romanée-Conti and the east by Romanée St. Vivant. Less
than 2,000 cases are produced per year; generally it is fuller, deeper in color and “bigger” than its adjoining vineyards
in the town of Vosne-Romanée. Charles Noellat is a small, impeccable producer who owns some of the choicest land
in the Richebourg vineyard and who estate-bottles every grape he produces.

Adjoins Romanée-Conti and Richebourg. Only 23 acres in size, most of the yield being now vinified by the Domaine
de la Romanée-Conti. Here is one of the best ones we have tasted, truly full, remarkable bouquet, great finesse, and
