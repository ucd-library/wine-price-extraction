FRENCH CHAMPAGNES &
SPARKLING WINES

The effervescent, carefree joy of these French sparkling wines
will add their touch of delight to your more significant summer
entertaining occasions. EACH IS ON SALE—the French Cham-
pagnes represent the best of that remarkable area—and are
priced dramatically low in light of the high replacement costs
in the Champagne district today. The Haute-Savoie and the
Loire Valley also contribute their best to add distinction to
your warm weather menus.

distinction.

highest level that can be achieved in that superlative wine-
