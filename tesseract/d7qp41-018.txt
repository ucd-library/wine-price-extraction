Rare, Irreplaceable

From the

Last Century 4

“The very existence, let alone the sheer perfection of these
Madeiras, is an historic wine event — these 19th Century
Madeiras have provided one of the great wine tasting ex-
periences of my life,” states JAMES BEARD.

We launch the new year with this dramatic sale presenta-
tion of great Madeiras. Here is a remarkable collection of
authentic old vintage and Solera Madeiras that cannot be
matched, either in continental Europe or the United States.

When these are gone, the opportunity to taste authentic old
vintage Madeiras of this calibre will be lost forever.

PORT TREASURES EMPHASIZING
GREAT YEARS Between 1921 and 1962

One of the noblest of the world’s great wines is undoubt-
edly Vintage and Crusted Port that achieves most of its
maturation, like fine still wine, in bottle rather than in cask.

Here are some exceptional examples from the cellars of
Richard Hooper, who was once Lord Mayor of London and
the Quinta do Noval, one of the best vineyards in the Port
area.

If you have not yet experienced the pleasurable wine-
drinking joy of port that bears the date of origin, we
strongly advise that you try one of the noblest of the
world’s great wines — authentic vintage port.

EPOCH-MAKING SALE OFFERING OF CHATEAU HAUT BRION 1963
PRICED DRAMATICALLY BELOW THE WORLD MARKET!

Chateau Haut Brion 1963 (contested only by Chateau Latour 1963) is acknowl-
edged as the best single wine produced in Bordeaux during 1963. It is entirely
remarkable in terms of flavor, bouquet and finesse. Relatively light, quick to
mature, Haut Brion ’63 will taste better because it is at a dinner party today, than
its successor Chateau Haut Brion ’64 which commands triple the price.

We do not exaggerate when we state that you cannot acquire this wine today in
Bordeaux at $3.99; most Paris shops demand 30 francs. We claim there is no
better value in great “First Growth” Claret today than Chateau Haut Brion 1963
at $3.99 the bottle, $46.75 the case.
