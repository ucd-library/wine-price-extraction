WHITE BORDEAUX...

232 CHATEAU FERRANDE 1966 (Graves) .. .-

Dry, well balanced, typical.

862 CHATEAU D’YQUEM 1960 ........--. :
Incomparable. We favor 1960 because it retains the dramatic sweetness
and finesse without the overpowering effect of a 1959 or ’61.

367 CHATEAU HAUT BRION BLANC 1966. .

A noble Graves that is unquestionably the best dry white wine of Bordeaux
and competes with the great dry white wines of the world. Scarce.

VIN ROSE...

454 ANJOU ROSE 1966 (Nicolas) .......-.
An excellent example of the soft, fruity flavor and delightful
color associated with the good pink wines of the Loire Valley.

852 SCIATINO ROSE 1966 (Corsica) ......
The warmth, sunshine and color of this beautiful island
is captured in this dry and engaging Rose.

790 BANDOL ROSE 1966 (Provence) ......
Grown along the Mediterranean coast near Toulon. Excellent.

Tavel comes from an arid, rocky little valley
between Avignon and Nimes—and is world famous.

742 ROSE DE SANCERRE 1967.........
“Are you Sancerre?” Can be asked of this noble Rose and
the answer is “yes.”’ Excellent—and from the Pinot Noir grape.

270 ROSE DE MARSANNAY 1966 (Andre Bart)
The noble grape “Pinot Noir” grown in the soil of Burgundy,
produces this truly superb pink wine. No nobler heritage exists.

FROM THE LOIRE VALLEY...

5006 ANJOU BLANC 1966 (Nicolas) .......
Beautiful pale color, rather fruity, good bouquet.
562 GROS PLANT 1967 (Sautejeau) ......

Grown in Brittany near Nantes. Similar to a Muscadet,
but a bit drier and more austere.

987 MONTLOUIS 1966 (Nicolas) ........
Faces Vouvray directly across the Loire. Even experts
cannot distinguish between them.

9008 VOUVRAY 1961 (Nicolas) ......4626-.
The cry of ““Ouvrez le Vouvray” is a splendid way of
greeting 1969. White, medium dry, fruity.

448 SANCERRE 1967 (Nicolas) .:.......-
Across the Loire from Pouilly Fume. Dry, delicate,
with much subtlety.

397 Me OUmare. 2900 (havin) 4.45.54 36 0s i
Fresh, dry, delicacy. At apex of its potential.

5013) ANJOU, CHATEAU DE FESLES 1962...

Fine character, with a dramatic fruity bouquet.

447 Cee Meee 1966. ee vie ce we as
The birthplace of Rabelais yields a light fresh red wine
—best when young. Most consumed locally.

ome MER APO? AT, Piped) «ss 6 6 os ve
“Quincy” is not a town in Massachusetts, but is one of the best
wine growing districts of the Loire. A dry white of much character.

433 POUILLY BLANC FUME 1966 (Ladoucette)
If one were looking for the Montrachet of the Loire Valley, he would
probably find it here at the de Ladoucette vineyard. Excellent.
