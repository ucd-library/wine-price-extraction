A Reappraisal of

RECENT VINTAGE YEARS
Including 1957

This vintage chart is presented in the belief
that it is the most complete and most reliable
guide to wine years that has yet been devised.
The appraisals were not arrived at idly —
they are the result of continuous tasting at
the vineyards and much careful evaluation
by Frank Schoonmaker, whose profound
knowledge in the field of wine is recognized
throughout Europe and America.

The high standard for wine selection ex-
pressed in this chart is carefully adhered to
in the buying policy of our shop. We cor-
dially invite you to visit us, where you may
‘browse’ in an unhurried atmosphere among
the largest and finest collection of wines and
spirits that can be had anywhere in the
country. And, of course, the services of our
well informed and helpful staff will be at
your complete disposal.
