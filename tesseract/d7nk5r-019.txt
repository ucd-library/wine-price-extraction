One of the great of our generation. Rich in fruit and charm, these wines have matured relatively
quickly. All are great attractiveness even for present drinking, but we do believe a year or two
more of bottle age will bring a reward to the more patient wine drinker, particularly when the great

are involved. The price level of these wines are relatively stabilized in relation to the ’59s, ’61s

and °62s, which are dramatically soaring on the market place of Bordeaux. However, all evidence
indicates that the °64s will go up substantially during the latter part of 1968.
