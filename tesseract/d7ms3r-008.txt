  

1966 CHATEAU BOTTLED

A great, great claret year and a worthy successor to the classic 1961s.

There is every indication that the prices will surge upwards within

the year because of the relative failure of the 1968s and the astro-
nomically high opening prices that the 1969 and 1970 clarets have
commanded on the Bordeaux market.

CHATEAU PICQUE-CAILLOU 2.69 29.05
A 1966 Chateau-bottled Graves of this heritage and at this
price represents an exceptional wine opportunity.

CHATEAU DASSAULT 3.29 35.55
A St. Emilion just coming into its own.

CHATEAU CLOS RENE 3.69 39.85
An outstanding Pomerol.

CHATEAU GREYSAC 3.79 40.95

CHATEAU MALESCOT

ST. EXUPERY 3.99 43.10
Paul Zuger, the proprietor, has brought this Margaux vine-
yard to its ultimate potential and we are dealing with a wine
that is worth much more than this price—largely because it
is not as well publicized as its neighbors—but surely equals
them in quality.

CHATEAU LYNCH BAGES 4.39 47.40
A Pauillae of depth and distinction.
CHATEAU BOUSCAUT 4.49 48.50

Delightful Graves. Ready now, with good life ahead.

A Pauillac that reached exalted heights in 1966.

A St. Estephe that is starting to show its greatness.
CHATEAU COS D’ESTOURNEL 4.99 593.90
St. Estephe reaches exalted heights here.
CHATEAU LEOVILLE LASCASES 5.79 62.55
Like Beychevelle, will soon disappear from market.
CHATEAU MOUTON

BARON PHILIPPE 7.89 85.21

Adjacent to Mouton Rothschild, and the same proprietor.
Only 9 cases—and then no more.
CHATEAU LA MISSION

HAUT BRION 7.99 86.30
A glorious Graves with 20 years of development ahead.
CHATEAU PALMER . 8.95 96.65
In Pomerol, it is Petrus that is hard to come by—in Margaux,
it is Chateau Palmer. Elegance and balance are amazing here.
CHATEAU AUSONE . s 10.50 114.15
Relatively low price for a great First Growth St. Emilion.
CHATEAU HAUT BRION.. 13.95 150.65
Great distinction, power and finesse. The perfect wine for
laying down.

CHATEAU MARGAUX 13.95 150.65
Margaux. Another First Growth glory.

CHATEAU EATOURS (52... 13.95 150.65
A Pauillac that is destined to outlive us all.

able in another two years.

One of the better years of our generation. Most of the wines
are ready for present drinking, but the great vinyeards may
require another year or two of bottle age.

Bottle Case
CHATEAU MAISON BLANCHE 2.19 23.65
A discovery in the mountains of St. Emilion.
CHATEAU CAPET 2.49 26.90

A superior chateau-bottling of St. Emilion. Now has suffi-
cient bottle age to make it outstanding in taste and in value.
Should you pull the cork and taste it, we suspect you will
come back for more, again and again.

CHATEAU BELGRAVE 3.49 37.70
Classified among the five great growths in 1855. Vineyard
lies on the boundary line of St. Julien. Beautiful example of
outstanding Medoc at relatively modest cost.

CHATEAU CLOS FOURTET 3.99 46.75
A Grand Cru St. Emilion. Similar in its taste qualities to a
Chateau Cheval Blanc, but a bit lighter. The price is aston-
ishing because this wine costs more than this in Bordeaux
on a trade level today. Also available in Magnums at 8.56,
49.75 the case of six.

CHATEAU DUHART MILON 3.99 46.75
A Pauillae adjacent to Lafite Rothschild, and owned by
Baron Eli de Rothschild. Because of the excellence of the
wine produced at this vineyard, Baron de Rothschild, start-
ing with the 1967 vintage, has chosen to now call the wine
‘Chateau Duhart-Milon Rothschild. We now understand
why. We have tasted this 1964 many times and it is utterly
astonishing and in its own quiet way can compete with the
very best vineyards of Pauillac. Since this wine commands,
wholesale in Bordeaux, approximately the price we are quot-
ing here, our advice is to acquire Chateau Duhart-Milon 1964
at this low level now.

CHATEAU BOUSCAUT 4.49 48.50
A Grand Cru Graves of unusual distinction. This 1964 ready
now.

CHATEAU TALBOT 5.99 64.70
An 1855 classified St. Julien that generally commands among
the highest prices in Bordeaux other than the First Growths.
Big, full-bodied, yet soft. Exceptional.

CHATEAU BEYCHEVELLE 7.79 84.15
One of the best of the 1964s.

CHATEAU LATOUR 13.50 145.80
Pauillac. Great life ahead.

CHATEAU MARGAUX 13.50 145.80

Elegance and finesse are distinguishing characteristics.

CHATEAU CHEVAL BLANC 14.95 161.45
Chateau bottled St. Emilion at its best.
CHATEAU HAUT BRION 16.95 183.05

Possibly the greatest of the ’64s. Should be acquired now.

CHATEAU MOUTON
ROTHSCHILD

Rich, full, great.

CHATEAU LAFITE ROTHSCHILD

Has now become very rare. Outstanding.

Quietly, and with a minimum of publicity, the perfect 1962
clarets are beginning to be appreciated by connoisseurs.
Quick to mature, here are the kind of clarets that can be
enjoyed today and for several years ahead.

CHATEAU LAFLEUR 4.49 48.50
Classified as an exceptional growth of Pomerol. Similar in
fullness, roundness and drama to its more illustrious neigh-
bor, Chateau Petrus. Entirely remarkable—worth much,
much more.

CHATEAU DUHART MILON 4.49 48.50
A Pauillac adjacent to Chateau Lafite Rothschild, sharing
the same proprietor, Baron Eli de Rothschild. Worth much

more.

CHATEAU LYNCH BAGES 4.79 51.75
Big and lusty Pauillac. Delicious now.

CHATEAU LATOUR 13.95 150.65
Relatively ready for Chateau Latour.

CHATEAU HAUT BRION 14.85 160.40

Only a few cases of this great Graves remain.
