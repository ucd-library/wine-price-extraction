Like Lora Cowdray, who acquired Chateau Latour in 1965, the Rt. Hon. Ernest Marples, M.-P. isa
Britisher who respects and has profound knowledge of the wines of France. The inevitable result
has been that he has acquired some of the best properties of Beaujolais, and has developed a warm
personal and affectionate relationship with the neighboring vignerons of the area. This has made
it possible for Ernest Marples to not only offer to the United States his own Estate-bottled
growths, but some of the best Estate-bottlings of nearby Pouilly-Fuissé, Moulin-a-Vent and
Morgon. It was out of mutual regard and mutual love of the grape among the growers of Beaujolais

that this astonishing collection of authentic Estate-bottlings has been created.

Mr. Ernest Marples has earned international acclaim as a member of the British Cabinet and as
its Minister of Transport—the man who "made London traffic work." A favorite disciple of the
late Winston Churchill, he is not aman to readily compromise, whether it be politics, construc-
tion or "wine." The eight gems from the Maconnais area listed below reflect his dedication to
excellence. The acquisition of these wines at this time will Save you 10% immediately, and
probably considerably more by next year, since the scarcity and excellence of the 1969 Estate-
pottlings will surely force the price upwards.

Similar in development to its more northerly neighbors on the Cote da‘Or, slow to

The best "Morgon" we have ever tasted.

Ruth and Ernest Marples spend many weekends at their Fleurie property, and can often
be seen walking the hills of Beaujolais. In his Encyclopedia, Alexis Lichine states,
"The most typical Beaujolais of all, perfectly expressing the fresh, fruity charm
of this blessed commune." We know of no better example, and Ernest Marples has

a right to be proud of what he has produced here.

It required the persuasiveness of a Cabinet Minister to get any 'Chiroubles' at all—
the scarcest of all wines of Beaujolais. It is the very wine that is featured,

at this very moment, in the best bistros of Paris such as, Allard, Bistro 121,

La Bourgogne, Chez Georges, Lyonnais and Chez Pauline. Get a case and relive

Burgundy has its Chambertin and Clos de Vougeot. Beaujolais has its "Moulin-a-Vent"
—far and away the best red wine growing area of the Macon—and always the most
expensive. This wine will live long—at least eight years of fruit and sturdiness
lie ahead. The grower, Mr. M. Chantin, is proud of his wine and Mr. Marples

is proud of his selection.

Chateau de Chaintré is the proud 15th Century Chateau property of Ernest Marples.
The Chateau is a fairy-tale version of a castle and is surrounded by a picturesque
moat. Beyond the moat there are vines that produce a delightful white wine, dry,
fruity, fresh and delicate. It is made from the same Pinot Chardonnay grape as
Pouilly-Fuissé, which is located less than half a mile away, and indistinguishable
even to the most tutored palate. For those who want to drink Pouilly-Fuissé and

are prepared to accept the expression "Beaujolais Blanc" on the label in exchange
for a saving of $12 the case—here is your "best bet."

‘The best dry white wine of the Maconnais. The price at the vineyard has doubled
because the quantity is half of normal. Pouilly-Fuissé, in general, will be almost
$5 the bottle by the Fall, Now is the time to buy this Estate-bottled beauty
