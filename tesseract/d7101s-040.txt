COINTREAU

What makes
Cointreau the
best-selling brand
of liqueur in the
world? Perhaps it
is the tantalizing
whisper of orange.
Or perhaps it is
Cointreau’s affinity
for other spirits.
Perhaps it is
because
Imaginative people
realize that
Cointreau is a
unique gift...a
treat to oneself
and to others.

DATED LIQUEUR SPECIALITE 80 |

American history
seems to indicate
that our cabinet
members favored
Kentucky bourbon.
In England, since
the early 19th
Century, Kings and
Prime Ministers
have preferred
Scotch whisky and
it has often been
TEACHER’S
HIGHLAND
CREAM. It rules
with a light hand,
authoritative but
not despotic.

CHATEAU FIGEAC
FIRST GREAT GROWTH — ST. EMILION

CHATEAU FIGEAC expresses the robust, round qualities
of St. Emilion—and at its best. FIGEAC is directly adja-
cent to Cheval Blanc, shares its noble qualities—and in
Our opinion, if the wines were tasted blind, it would be
its equal. Pay particular heed to the 1966—great, ready,
remarkable—and we offer it at a price below the current
Bordeaux wholesale cost.

From Livorno on
the Tuscan Coast
arrives this en-
chanting new Italian
liqueur. Legend has
it that Tuaca was
bornin Renaissance
Florence and was
favored in the great

sure one sip of this
distinctive, haunting
liqueur will make it
a favorite in your
home, too.
