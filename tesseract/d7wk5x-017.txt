Our associate, James Beard,
has been referred to by the press as “King
of the American food experts.’ Many of you
know him from our shop or from his monthly
articles on wine in “House & Garden” and,
like all people who love their subject, he en-
joys teaching. His cooking seminars have won
the plaudits of the New York gastronomic
world. His next semester will start sometime
in January. Inquiries can be addressed to

surrounded by fine
old bottles you see on the front cover of this,
our 24th Christmas brochure, somehow to me,
captures in its own quiet way, the true Yule-
tide spirit. The picture was originally taken
by Percy Hennel, one of England’s greatest
photographers, in the private cellar of an old
English country house and appeared as the
jacket on André Simon’s new book on the
‘Wines of France.’ Coincidentally enough, the
wine rack portrayed is similar to the one that
can be acquired at our shop. I suggest you
read the whole story inside the front cover of
this catalogue. Few gifts will be as meaningful
as twelve well chosen bottles of good wine,
not necessarily expensive, whether they be

French, American, Italian or German, in this

rack; certainly the handsomest I have ever
encountered. I cannot leave the subject of con-
tainers without a word or two of praise for
our old favorites, the gay “Le Can-Can,” the
decorative Drum Cooler, the imaginative
Locomotive Basket and, our traditional friend,
the London Wicker Hamper. The cost of any
of these is small indeed, but surely will reflect
added thought on your part when the gift is
finally opened on Christmas Day.

I have long been a devotee of good Cham-
pagne and I can report, after a dozen pleasant
encounters with it that Cuvee Rainier Brut of
Pommery & Greno plays its role as the spar-
kling symbol of good cheer in a grand manner
(the price is unbelievable—only 5.99—ideally
suited as your Yuletide message to friends).
And, you can also discover in our cellars, the
“truly greats,” among the Champagnes such
as Dom Perignon 1947, Roederer Cristal
1949, Bollinger 1949, Krug 1949, Mumm’s
1949 and some of the very scarce Pol Roger
1947. However, if you intend serving Cham-
pagne at one of your parties, and you will need
quite a bit of it, there is still some good wine
to be had that will cost you little more than if
you were serving “Scotch & Soda”—they are

by vast innovations,
the traditional courtesies of life, such as the
exchange of greeting cards take on added
meaning and warmth. Though I doubt a single
“egg nog” is served from January 2nd until
December 15th, even the most confirmed
Martini drinker must yield to its luxurious
appeal and seasonal significance. Nor deign
I fail to repeat my favorite “egg nog” recipe
once again in our brochure under the pressure
of dozens of requests already received. Before
I speak of other matters, here is my version
of this time-honored drink.
WHISKEY EGG NOG (50 CUPS)
Beat 12 egg yolks until light. Add gradu-
ally 114 cups fine granulated sugar and con-
tinue to beat until the yolks are thick and
light in color. Pour this mixture into a punch
bowl which has been placed on a bed of
cracked ice. Whip in one quart heavy cream
and one quart milk and then add one quart
rye or bourbon very slowly at first, stirring
constantly. Let the punch settle for a few
minutes and lastly fold in 12 egg whites
which have been beaten until stiff. Serve with
a sprinkle of freshly grated nutmeg on top
of each portion.
frost
damage has cut the 1957 crop in half for most
of Europe, and it is no longer an easy task to
obtain good wine to sell at modest cost. We
found the answer in the sun-blessed valley ot
the Rhone. I urge that you try our PONT
D’AVIGNON 1955, it has now become my

favorite everyday wine and I happily report
