SPECIAL SALE OPPORTUNITY

CHATEAU DE LA CHAIZE 1972 - BEAUJOLAIS AT ITS BEST - ON SALE DURING THIS PERIOD.

The Chateau de La Chaize vineyard, in the famed
wine growing district of Brouilly, has been maintained
from father to son, for over three centuries by the
Marquis de Roussy de Sales family. Tradition dictates
that they never compromise with dedication and
excellence. The Marquis de Roussy de Sales spends
most weekends with his charming wife, Nicole,
among the rolling hills of Beaujolais, cultivating

the vine.

Here, we are not dealing with a nondescrip Beaujolais,
but rather with an estate-bottled Brouilly produced on
some of the best soil of the district, during the fruity,
fresh, utterly delicious 1972 vintage. Since every
bottle comes from the estate, and it was not blended
with lesser Beaujolais, the production is relatively
small and is rationed throughout the world. Asa
consequence, we urge that you anticipate your Spring-
Summer requirements as early as possible to avoid
