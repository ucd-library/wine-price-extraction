Last Spring, at a ceremony in
Jerez given by the “Sherry
Growers of Spain”, the genial
member of our firm, Jack Aaron,
was given the award “Amigo del
Vino de Jerez”. Of particular
significance was the fact that
this marked the first time that
this honor was granted to an
American. Mr. Aaron’s knowl-
edge of Sherry and the Sherry
country is profound. He reports
here briefly on one phase of his
visit.

“The Sherry Growers are a warm, civilized and friendly group. I
shall never forget the hospitality showered on me by Guy Williams,
Bobadilla, Gonzalez, Wisdom & Warter and Domecq. My travel ad-
vice to you is simple—if ever you find yourself in Spain, make cer-
tain you visit the bodegas of the Sherry country for a heartwarming

rewarding experience.

Chaucer wrote about Sherry, Shakespeare immortalized ‘Sack’, and
Drake fought for it—and to this day the British influence remains
strong. The Sherry firm of Williams & Humbert, for one, still main-
tains its British character, all of the partners and all of the capital
being English. Their bodegas in Jerez are quite literally “some corner
of a foreign field that is forever English,” since it is also the British
Consulate by virtue of the fact that Guy Williams is the Vice Consul.
I also discovered that Guy Williams’ older brother shared a room at
Harrow with Sir Winston Churchill and remained his lifelong friend.
[| am particularly ‘ndebted to Mr. Williams for his graciousness and
the opportunity to learn more about his delightful wines.

The Sherry exported by Williams & Humbert is created to meet the
exacting English taste. Their best known is DRY SACK, which is a
Palo Cortado of unusual age and smoothness. And now they are
shipping a companion piece, the nutty, full flavored, rounded CA-
NASTA CREAM. In my opinion, both of these are top flight and the
best that Spain has to offer within their particular class.”
