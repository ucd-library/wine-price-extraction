e quote Frank Prial from an article entitled

Bargains from Spain, which appeared in The

New York Times Magazine:

“It would not be inaccurate to say that Spanish
wines are one of the best-kept secrets of the wine world.
They range from simple, uncomplicated table wines to
sophisticated, subtle wines made for connoisseurs.”

All the wines we list from the Penedes region are produced
by the renowned Torres family—perhaps the best producer in
the region. The best known names in the Rioja are the
Marques de Arienzo, the Marques de Caceres and Marques de
Riscal. Note that all of these wines are on sale, and that we
offer them below the prices they command at most wine
shops in the New York area.

“A stylistic breakthrough among Spanish sparklers””—Wine Country Magazine

“T have tried numerous effervescent
wines over the years, but the Lembey is the
first one I can enthusiastically endorse.”

—Martin Gersh, Vogue Magazine

Champagnes and sparkling wines are served gaily
and freely. Domecq Lembey is ideally suited for
large parties, home celebrations and weekend gift-

ierre de Domecq Lembey, a French aris-
tocrat, migrated to Spain in 1730 and
established the House of Domecq. It is out

 

of this French-Spanish tradition that this
sparkling wine was born. It is outstandingly dry
and delightful. Domecq Lembey possesses the
qualities of fine French Champagne with its rich,
toasty, yeasty characteristics. It comes as no
surprise that many critics acclaim this as Spain’s
best sparkler.

This wondrous sparkling wine comes into its own
during the warm summer months—a time when
