To understand Pouilly-Fuissé,
you must know that two towns
are involved.

Bernard Bachelet

Bernard Bachelet is a worthy small
proprietor—a man whose house and
cellars are ‘one’—and who has one
compelling interest in life, to make
better wine than his neighbors just
as an artist achieves gratification by
painting in more creative fashion
than the others who share his studio.

We are not dealing with great wine
here—but good, honest, full, soft
and charming wine that has its
own appeal and its own message.
And among them is that it is pos-
sible to acquire excellent estate-
bottled red Burgundies below $3.00
the bottle. We know of no worthier
example.

Here is Pierre Bitouzet—young,
handsome, capable—the man that
Prince de Merode selected to
manage his vineyards.

Prerre Bitouzet

The Bitouzet family have been till-
ing the soil of Savigny for many
generations. It was the Prince de
Merode who recognized his wine-
making talents and now employs
him to direct his wine holdings. The
distinguishing characteristics of
this wine are supple softness, fruiti-
ness and relatively fast maturation
with an abundance of delicacy and
finesse. Here is a money-saving find
that maintains high quality in a
wine market dominated by scarcity
and high cost.

Reneé Roy

Here is where a bit of bravery will
pay off. All but unknown in America
(but much appreciated in France)
is this vineyard, hidden behind the
more famous slopes of Volnay and
Pommard. The price is lower, not
because the wine is not as good, but
because it does not enjoy the same
world fame and demand.

 

René Roy walks to Pommard
every day, knows he makes better
wine than most of the Pommard
growers, and eagerly searches
for world recognition for his

The noble, much sought-after red

best, giving a rather full-bodied
wine. He talks about his 1969 having
“great fruit and suppleness.” And
directly adjoining Pommard there is
a town of Beaune, which M. Parent
invaded to acquire the noble ‘Bou-
cherottes’ vineyard, a wine that has
the same kind of grace and balance
usually associated with Pommard,
but a bit less costly, since it is not as
well known.
