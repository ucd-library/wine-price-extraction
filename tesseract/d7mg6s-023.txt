It is generally acknowledged that the best small distiller in
Alsace is Alfred Hess. It is his ‘alcools blancs’ that are
served in the great restaurants of France, such as the
Restaurant de la Pyramide (Point) and Hotel de la Cote
d’Or (Dumaine). Monsieur Hess lives at the foot of the
Vosges Mountains, in a zone famous for its fruit, both
cultivated (the plums called Quetschs and Mirabelles) and
wild (the wild cherries for Kirsch and the wild raspberries
for Framboise).

Only after several years of negotiations, was he finally per-
suaded to ship us a small quantity of his precious bottles,
the best eaux-de-vie of all Alsace. Often served chilled,
remarkable for their bouquet, these are among the most
interesting and delightful of after dinner brandies —as
such, perhaps the most highly regarded rivals of fine Cognac.

QUETSCH.... 8.50 43 49
ll his Eaux

The distillery of Monsieur Hess never exceeds more than 600 cases of all
de-Vie combined in any one year. Just outside his distillery is his own orchard from
whence comes the small purple plums out of which this remarkable Quetsch is made.

MIRABELLE........... I 8.935

Remarkable for its bouquet, this extraordinary fruit brauas is made from little yellow
plums, largely from his own orchard, but he does buy some from neighboring oc ers.

KIRSCH. ALG 10.50

The wild cherries ae Ww hich this Kissel. is sae must be gathered at an altitude
above 1000 feet in order to achieve the proper flavor. The ordinary commercial

Kirsch bears no comparison. :
FRAMBOISE chee 13.95

We often hear stories of the remarkable Framboise that was found in the home of the
Mayor or local Curé of one of the small towns in Alsace. Candidly, no matter how
remote the source, we doubt any are the equal of this one. Mr. Hess’s truck and men
ascend the mountains to an altitude well beyond 1500 feet to pick the wild raspberries.
