New York’s best value in top-flight French Champagne.
Remarkably low price in light of today’s high cost for
fine French Champagne.

94 PERRIER JQUET BRUT 2. oes ok 8.95 96.66
Perrier Jouét is one of the most prestigious of the great
Champagne houses. Wine of this calibre normally com-

serve a great dry Brut Champagne at low sale cost.

113 LEDOYEN BLANC DE BLANCGS

BRUT 1908 6 8.95 98.00
The very wine served as the ‘champagne de maison’ at
Ledoyen, one of the great restaurants of Paris. Gilbert
Lejeune, the proprietor of this elegant establishment on
the Champs-Elysées, personally selects this cuvée from
a small firm in Champagne. Having marvelled at the wine
in his beautiful restaurant, we are pleased to be able to
bring its joy to your holiday entertaining and gift giving.
And our pleasure is doubled since this great wine is
available at a truly low price.

AMERICAN
CHAMPAGNES

America can now be proud of the dry sparkling wines produced
within its borders. Only a decade ago, one would not have
thought it was possible to achieve the balance, finesse, and true
excellence that is demonstrated by the superior Champagnes
produced at the Korbel Vineyards and Schramsberg Vineyards
of California. Both of these can hold their head high even in
the noblest company of French Champagnes. We recommend
them unreservedly.
