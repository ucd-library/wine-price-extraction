The proud director of one of Bordeaux’s most famed
Chateaux was in our shop during late November, and
after browsing through this wine list, commented ‘My
hobby is collecting wine lists from everywhere, and
they date back to the mid 19th Century—none, in my
opinion, match this one of Sherry-Lehmann’s for
daring vision, vast range, and discriminating care in
selection—Congratulations.”’
