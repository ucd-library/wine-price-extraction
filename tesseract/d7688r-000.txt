Maryland’ Finest Straight Rye

At a New Sensationally Low Price!

MOUNT VERNON
Seven Year Old — 86 Proof

Straight Maryland Rye

  

OUR MOST
REMARKABLE OFFERING
OF FINE OLD RYE
IN OVER A DECADE!

  

Here is a famous 7 Year Old Maryland Rye bottled
at the lighter, milder 86 proof. Seven long years
of maturation in wood has given this fine old Mount
Vernon Rye the delicacy, mellowness and flavor that
can only be achieved through the slow process of

proper aging.

  

Here is a whiskey of tradition — a Rye that has been
popular on the American scene since Colonial days.
Frankly, a whiskey of this reputation, age and pedi-
sree, would be good value at $5.00 — at the unbe-
lievably low price of $3.99 the bottle, it is nothing

short of Sensational.
