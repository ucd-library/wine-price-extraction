inexpensive wine drinking in
America since repeal” states James
Beard, noted wine and food au-
thority.

These gay, light-hearted wines, bottled
proudly at a vineyard on the Sonoma hill-
sides, make no more pretentions to great-
ness than the cheerful little country wines
of France. Like these, they are fresh, clean
and satisfying wines such as can be found
in many of France’s country inn cellars;
and they are without label or date, but
none-the-less, good. Our ST. MICHEL

the impeccable firm of Blandy certifying that the bottle con-
tains a genuine Madeira of the vintage stated. Most of these
vintage Madeiras have disappeared from our cellars, but these

His 1960s are typical, with great freshness
and charm, coupled with pronounced bou-
quet and distinction. Each of these five wines
is outstanding and is priced well below the

qualities they exhibit.
