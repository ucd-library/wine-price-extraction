When the sugar cane was planted in the West Indies, rum followed as a matter

of course and West Indies rums became famous around the world. The finest
of them still come from there and rum is one of the Western World’s greatest

liquid contributions to the cheer and comfort of mankind.

Every Caribbean island which produces Rum, from Cuba to Trinidad, has

I

its own individual product; Jamaica, smoky and aromatic; Cuba, pale and light-

bodied: and many others. The Rums of our own possessions, Puerto Rico and
the Virein Islands, are excellent. They are generally light and delicate.

The list herewith contains Rums from everywhere from which to choose the

one which suits you best.
