NIERSTEINER ROSENBERG SPATLESE 1953 . ; ; ; 249 27.95

1953 on the Rhine has proven to be one of the greatest years of the last two decades. 1954 is destined to be a failure, the price
of the 53’s have surged upward substantially since we have acquired this extraordinary Rhine. A magnificent bottle today, it
will be even more glorious a year hence.

Owned and operated by the German State, the Steinberg vineyard is traditionally ranked as one of the Rheingau’s four or five
greatest. Frank Schoonmaker, who selected this wine at the vineyard, considers this 1953 one of the most magnificent examples
of Rhine wines he ran across.

KASELER STEINIGER SPATLESE 1952. . . : ; 249 27.95

An exceptionally fine example of great Moselle grown and bottled by the students at a school for Priests. This exceptional

PIESPORTER GOLDTROPFCHEN GUNTERSLAY SPATLESE 1952. . 2.99 34.75
(Estate Bottled, Weingut Keppern-Zerbes)

“Goldtropfchen” and “Gunterslay” are two of the finest vineyards in the wine growing town of Piesport. Occasionally, an
Estate bottler finds it necessary to combine the yield of two vineyards in order to fill a Fuder, or barrel. Thus, this noble,
exceptional example of great Moselle bears the name of two great vineyards instead of, as is customary, just one.
