SHERRY’S SALE PRICES
No Higher than a Year Ago! |

We still offer the great 1952 and 1953 Clarets at low sale prices, based on our

original cost, and not on the much higher replacement prices that now prevail on

the Bordeaux market. Because of frost damage, there never has been such a short-

age of wine in recent memory — almost as many empty barrels can be seen in the
is cellars as there are full ones. All of this adds up to an unwillingness of the vigneron

to part with his precious stock. We advise acquisition before March 15th, before
depletion, and before prices move upwards — and we would like to remind you
that we will gladly store your purchases in our cool, underground cellars for as
long as one year, free of charge.
