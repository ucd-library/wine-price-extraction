We quote from the ‘“‘Beverage
Media,” the definitive journal for the
wine merchants of the New York
area.

“The fascinating lore of wine and
its pleasures, commentaries by cele-
brities and connoisseurs, plus simul-
taneous screening by some 160 TY
stations across the country, made
the first national television program
on wine a milestone event.
Produced by National Educational
Television (N.E.T.), the hour-long
program was telecast in prime eve-
ning time as an absorbing version of
the ‘Your Money’s Worth’ show. It
sought to remove some of the ‘mys-
tery’ and ‘snobbery’ that often sur-
rounds wine and to demonstrate that
buying wine can be as practical a
matter as the purchase of any other
commodity.

 

Burgess Meredith, actor-
director and connoisseur,

tional Educational Tele-
vision’s consumer series

“Your Dollar’s Worth.”

Featured in this full-color program
were celebrity-actor-director Bur-
gess Meredith; Episcopal priest-
gourmet-author Father Robert
Capon; and wine sipper and world-
wide wine authority Peter Sichel;
all of whom gave their views on the
various characteristics and costs of
wines and participated in a blind
tasting.

Well known wine and spirits retailer
Sam Aaron, president of New York’s
Sherry-Lehmann, Inc. gave some
very practical advice on starting a
$50 wine cellar.

Commentaries included both Ameri-
can and imported wine types. Among
interesting points was an explana-
tion by Burgess Meredith on how to
taste wine properly—smell for bou-
quet, hold to light for color, put a
tiny bit of wine under the tongue
and breathe. (The taste, Mr. Sichel
commented, will continue to be with
you for a number of seconds, or will
stop suddenly—the length of time
refiects the greatness of the wine. )
Sherry-Lehmann’s Sam Aaron spoke
on the value of vintage charts as
general guides but cautioned against
taking them too literally. He pointed
out that great vineyards have pro-
duced poor wines during great years
and extraordinary wines during a
poor year. He also urged budding
wine devotees to ‘adventure among
the vineyards of the world,’ to try a
great variety of wines whether they
be from California, New York,
France, Spain, Portugal, Germany,
Israel, Australia or wine-producing
countries of South America. ‘It’s not
enough to just find a wine you like
and repeat yourself ad infinitum,’ he
said.
