Wtf ADVANCE REPORTS FROM BOR-
iM DEAUX indicate clearly and indisputably
that the 1961 Clarets have yielded less than
40% of a normal crop, approximating the
quality of the great 1945s and will ulti-
mately command a price, after bottling,
that will make the 1959s appear like cut-
rate bargains. We shudder to give you the
1961 prices but we do know that many
lesser Chateaux cost more in the 1961
market today than the peerless Chateau
Haut Brion of 1959 commanded on the
same date two years ago.

The prices listed below for the 1959
chateau-bottled Clarets may seem high if
you compare them with what you were
, paying for the 1955s two years ago, but
we must repeat in full sincerity that these very wines cost approxi-
mately the same in Bordeaux today on a wholesale trade level that
we are quoting you below. We do admit that they are not inexpensive
but we must assert that the wines are truly great, are priced here well
below the market and will command considerably higher quotations
a year from now. Our advice is simple—if you want 1959 Clarets, buy
them now or resign yourself to never having the personal pleasure of
their fantastic greatness in your wine cellar.

Alexis Lichine. In 1959, thanks to dedication, a wine was made that
approximates in subtlety, fruit and finesse, the classic Chateau Margaux.

711 *CHATEAU LEOVILLE LASCASES (St. Julien) 41.50
In two successive wine tastings in Bordeaux, we found this vineyard
second to none in 1959. We inquired why—the answer was that a
Professor of Viniculture at the University of Bordeaux instituted new
techniques that succeeded fantastically Deep in color, powerful bou-
quet, it will, upon maturity, be pure velvet.

A23 CHATEAU PETRUS (Pomerol) 75.00

Matisse.

A25 *CHATEAU LATOUR (Pauillac) 85.00
Wine has been consistently great since 1955.

A27 *CHATEAU MARGAUX 85.00

In 1959 this vineyard succeeded in producing its characteristic wine
of delicate elegance.
A29 *CHATEAU CHEVAL BLANC (St. Emilion) 85.00

growths of the Medoc and Graves.

A31 CHATEAU AUSONE (St. Emilion) 87.50
Production pitiably small. A collector’s item.
A33 *CHATEAU MOUTON ROTHSCHILD (Pauillac) 87.50

We quote the cellar master about his 1959: “This is not wine—but a
liquid glory—the best of my lifetime.”

Exceeds even the great 1953 Lafite—hard to come by.
A37 *CHATEAU HAUT BRION (Graves) 87.50

This wine now commands almost $100 on the open trade market of
Bordeaux and it is practically impossible to obtain. Reached great
heights and undoubtedly will make a serious bid to be considered the
greatest single red wine of our generation.
