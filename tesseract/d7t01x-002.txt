ON WINE With FOOD

A great deal of complicated nonsense has
been published in this country about the serv-
ice of wines, as if this were a ritual, devised
by some secret society of “connoisseurs.” As
a result, a great many people who would
otherwise have given wine a fair trial, and
who assuredly would have found that they
liked it and enjoyed it, have been impelled
to regard the whole business as so much spin-
ach, and wine as a drink for snobs. This is
too bad; wine, as millions of people have
discov ered, since Shakespeare and before him,
“Is a good familiar creature if it be well used.”

Most of the real rules (and there are a
few) are a matter of common sense and any
person of intelligence and taste would dis-
cover them for himself in the course of
drinking a glass or two of wine with dinner
every evening over the space of a few months.

White wines and rosés (pink) should be
served chilled, or iced in very hot weather; at
50 to 60 degrees they are refreshing and
appetizing, whereas they taste insipid or
cloying at 70 or over.

According to tradition, red wines should be
served at room temperature — but this cer-
tainly does not mean room temperature in
New Orleans in summer. Actually no wine
tastes good at over 75 degrees and, except for

few great bottles, 65 degrees is much to be
preferred in summer

All wines are better in large glasses (of
course not filled to the brim — one-half full
is plenty). The wine’s bouquet is thus trapped
inside th € sak: and can be better appreciated.
