Two of the greatest white wine
vineyards of the world are Mont-

yi rachet and Berncasteler Doctor.
. They are hard to come by re-
AY gardless of price. At $5.99, this
- is a unique opportunity not to be

   

overlooked by those who want
white wine at its absolute best.

WHITE WINES

674 GRAND MONTRACHET 1955

Y

oO

Estate Bottled, Baron Thenard

One of the white wine glories of France. Montrachets
bearing the name of Baron Thenard on the label is much
sought after and hard to come by. An amazing harmony.

04 BERNCASTELER DOCTOR SPATLESE

1955, Estate Bottled, Dr. H. Thanisch

During our visit to Berncasteler Doctor last year, we were
particularly impressed by the superb quality that they
achieved during the 1955 vintage. Perhaps not as rich
or sweet as 1953, but surely the equal in class and dis-
tinction.

Several of the most remarkable
vineyards of Europe appear in
this category. You may choose
a mixed case of any 12 of these
glorious wines at the case price

of $46.75.

CHATEAU D’YQUEM 1953

As a wine name, Chateau d’Yquem represents the ultimate

as Rolls-Royce and Caviar do in their respective classes.
It is a rich, full, glorious and sweet wine from Sauternes.
Normally it commands well over $7 the bottle — at this
unbelievably low cost, we urge that you acquire some for
your special dinner parties.

CLOS, BLANC DE VOUGEOT, 1953

For centuries, the good Cistercian Monks who labored in
the vineyards of Clos de Vougeot have made it a practice
to dedicate a small portion of the vineyard to the produc-
tion of white wine. You will be delighted with the deli-
cate dryness, exquisite finesse and unique bouquet of this
collector’s item.

RHINE & MOSELLE WINES

SCHLOSS JOHANNISBERGER CABI-
NET SPATLESE 1953,

Estate Bottled, Prince von Metternich
A fantastic Rhine wine — “‘Spatlese Cabinet 1953” from
one of the most majestic vineyards of all Germany. A

true rarity.
RAUENTHALER WIESHELL AUS-

LESE KABINET 1953,

German State Domaine

In the opinion of most of the German wine experts, an
Auslese from one of Rauenthal’s better vineyards, particu-
larly in 1953, is one of the truly great examples of Rhine
wine. Commands fabulous prices at the annual German
wine auctions.

SCHARZHOFBERGER SPATLESE 1953
Estate Bottled, Hohe Domkirche

An astonishingly fine Moselle from that portion of Scharz-
hofberg owned by the Cathedral of Trier. Few white wines
in the world can compete with it.

RED WINES
CHATEAU LYNCH BAGES 1945

A rare survivor from a vintage year that is now but a
fond memory in Bordeaux. A Claret of great stature, un-
usual depth and sheer perfection for present drinking.
Alas, there are but 18 cases.

MAZIS CHAMBERTIN 1955
Estate Bottled, Pierre Gelin

One of the most remarkable Burgundian treasures that
we ran across in the Cote de Nuits. From a tiny vineyard
that is the northern prolongation of Chambertin, Clos de
Beze. A very great 1955.

SAVIGNY LES BEAUNE 1937
Estate Bottled, Doudet-Naudin

Many of you are familiar with the treasures of Naudin’s
pre-war ‘“‘Forgotten Cellar” that was sealed back in 1942
and not opened again until 1955. Here is one of the great
undisturbed and venerable bottles that survived the oc-
cupation. Remarkable.

CLOS VOUGEOT 1952

Estate Bottled, Gouroux

A classic red Burgundy from the Clos Vougeot vineyard —
the largest and most famous Clos of Burgundy.

BONNES MARES 1953
Estate Bottled, Claire-Dau

In Chambolle, there are two really great vineyards —
Musigny and Bonnes Mares. Like Musigny, this has a
glorious perfume and a lingering bouquet.
