During this sale period, we offer the classic Chateau bottled wines
of the great 1959 vintage; the light, excellent 1960's, ready for
present drinking, and some of the older vintages. On these pages
can be found some of the greatest Bordeaux opportunities that

have been presented to the New York public in many years.

Despite the ever increasing replacement costs in Bordeaux, our

large scale purchases have enabled us to roll back the prices. % A Vy K
