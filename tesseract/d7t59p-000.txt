ADVANCE OFFERING OF THE GREAT 1969 RED BURGUNDIES

We know of no better way of testifying to the true excellence of the 1969 red Burgundies than to simply
quote Frank Schoonmaker's recently issued Vintage Report, "1969 is an exceedingly great year in
Burgundy, quite in the class with fabulous 1961 ... deep=colored, rich, everything that fine Burgundies
should be ... a few conceivably even 20/20, which is as high as | can go". We know of no more
persuasive statement to justify anticipating your future requirements than the objective evaluation by
Mr. Schoonmaker - an opinion shared unanimously by the Burgundy wine growers' community.

Below we indicate the prices that will prevail on May 22nd - even this price level will unquestionably
be higher before the year ends. If you order now - by Saturday, May 20th - you will enjoy a 10%
discount. All of the red Burgundies listed below will reach us during May or early June and delivery
can be made immediately thereafter, based on your convenience.

SANTENAY (Bernard Bachelet) 42.00
Light, fresh, fruity, quick maturing. Can be enjoyed immediately.

COTE DE BEAUNE VILLAGES (Bernard Bachelet) 43.10
‘Cote de Beaune Villages’ is frequently used as a blanket name to
encompass some of the best wine produced in the Cote de Beaune
vineyards, Here isa supreme example.

SAVIGNY LES BEAUNE (Pierre Bitouzet) 45.90
Supple, fruity and quick to mature. Dependable.

CHASSAGNE-MONTRACHET (Bachelet-Ramonet) 47,40
Although Chassagne-Montrachet is perhaps more famed for its white
wines, those who appreciate fine red Burgundy have learned to
recognize the virtues of the red wines produced here.

CHASSAGNE-MONTRACHET, BOUDRIOTTES (Bachelet-Ramonet) 53.90
The red wine of Chassagne-Montrachet flourishes, particularly
when an outstanding, specific vineyard such as Boudriottes is
the source and the Ramonet family are the vignerons.

BEAUNE BOUCHEROTTES (Domaine Parent) 53.90
Our recent visit to M. Parent demonstrated clearly the stature of
his wines and his dedication to excellence. Long-lived.

Wines bearing an asterisk are available in half bottles at $3.00 additional.
