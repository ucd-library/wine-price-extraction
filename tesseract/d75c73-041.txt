Vintage
From the

Last Century

Reid’s Hotel on the island of Madeira has now become the
sophisticated gathering spot of Britishers and Americans. And
when they return home, they speak glowingly of the fantastic
vintage Madeiras they experienced during their stay — and
how elated they are when they find that some of the 19th
Century Madeiras can be found right here in New York — at
Sherry’s. And we now quote James Beard, international food
authority, “The very existence, let alone the sheer perfection
of these Madeiras, is an historic wine event —these 19th
Century Madeiras have provided one of the great wine tasting
experiences of my life.”

 

These rare Madeiras are on sale until September Ist — now
is the time to buy them. When these are gone, the opportunity
to taste authentic old vintage Madeiras of his calibre will be
lost forever.

BARRISTER’S CHOICE is one of the most re-
markable whiskies we have offered in years. It
has fully matured for 12 years and the age ap- Jf
pears on the label. The balance is sheer har- :
mony, the flavor is rich and light, and the delicacy

is remarkable. One need not have to be licensed

to practice before the Supreme Court to enjoy

its virtues. As a matter of fact, it would have

particular appeal to economists and accountants |
because simply on the basis of price alone it
would be persuasive —!IT COST LESS THAN
$5.49 THE BOTTLE!

WHY BUY VINTAGE PORT IN THE SUMMER?

Firstly, they are on sale now until August 31st; secondly,
since they are becoming scarce, the prices should go up fairly
substantially by next winter; and thirdly, to obtain authentic
bottle age vintage ports, regardless of the season, is quite a
wine acquisition in its own right.

If you have not yet experienced the pleasurable wine-drinking
joy of port that proudly bears the date of origin on its label,
we strongly advise that you try one of the noblest of the
world’s great wines — whether it be on your summer terrace
or in front of a warming fireplace when the wintry gales will
be roaring outside.

CHATEAU LATOUR 1965 y
AT ONLY $4.49 THE BOTTLE! ty

Chateau Latour is a ‘First Growth’ Medoc, and
in the same exalted company as Chateau Mar-
gaux and Chateau Lafite Rothschild. It is one of
the most robust, full-bodied and noblest red ie
wines of all France. Because of its concentrated {
richness, it is generally slow to mature and often

requires a decade.

However, in a year such as 1965, a vintage domi-
nated by lightness, Chateau Latour acquires per-
fect balance relatively quick and the wnie can
be consumed with great appreciation within five
years of the harvest. The class, the finesse, and
power will all be apparent after the first sip.
Here is great claret of impeccable pedigree at
astonishingly low cost. Quantity limited.
