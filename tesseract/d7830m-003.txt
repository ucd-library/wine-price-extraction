RED WINES

253 BEAUJOLAIS 1955, Domaine du Ringuet

Our best-seller among our red wines and for good reason
—we quote the review this wine received in the New
York Times, January 29th, “‘then there is a Beaujolais that
is all a Beaujolais should be, but alas, seldom in this
country — purplish-red, with the fruity aroma and taste
of crushed grapes. In our opinion, a true discovery for
those who want true Beaujolais at a modest price.”

guished Chateau bottled Claret. A real beauty. Only 18
causes remain.

ences, One runs across a local wine of quite extraordinary
quality and charm. This Vire of Macon is such a wine.
Made of the Chardonnay grape as is Pouilly Fuisse, it is
dry, fresh, and an engaging white wine. One of the hap-
piest of our recent discoveries.

QUINCY 1955

Estate Bottled, Gaston Laphal

Just north of Bourges, there is the little town of Quincy
(no relation to the Massachusetts family) which has only
550 acres under wine cultivation. Because of low produc-
tion, it is hard to come by. The most pronounced features
are its highly perfumed bouquet and unusual finesse.
