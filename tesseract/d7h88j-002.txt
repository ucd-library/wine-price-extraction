Estate Bottled, Domaine Leflaive
The ‘Pucelles’ vineyard is outstanding in the commune of Puligny-Montrachet. We have tasted this wine on a dozen occasions and
were impressed in each instance by its delicacy, bouquet and clean dry finish. The 1946 vintage produced many excellent white
ane Burgundies that were well above average. We were informed by Bellows & Co. that a goodly proportion of the shipment was sold
9D at $3.70 and well worth it. At the remarkable price of $1.61, this wine will surely fly out of our shop we therefore suggest you
order quickly. Here is an opportunity to drink truly great white wine this summer at sensationally low cost.

The 1942 vintage proved more successful in Sauternes than in any otlier wine growing district of krance. As a matter of fact, as a
95 result of recent tastings, many wine experts consider this year absolutely great in Sauternes. Here is a ‘premier cru’ that would
eer e certainly cost much more than this even if you attempted to buy it right in Bordeaux. Many cases of this wine were sold dur-

ing 1950 at $4.18 the bottle. It possesses all of the richness, lusciousness, and finesse associated with great Sauternes.

ce . . .
The greatest wine of Sauternes are not picked bunch by bunch, but grape by grape, and the harvest sometimes may continue right
up to Christmas. At Rayne Vigneau, they follow the practice of calling those barrels which were last picked and therefore the
richest ‘Creme de Tete’. Naturally, these better barrels command a higher price on the Bordeaux market since they rival in
quality even the wines of Chateau d’Yquem. Because of relatively high alcoholic content, such wines can live for many decades
so, if you are fond of Sauternes, don’t overlook this opportunity even if it means buying years ahead.

1.50 The Chateau Mouton Rothschild has been in the Rothschild family since 1868, and no pains have been spared in maintaining
the exceptional quality of its wines. Adjoining this Chateau is Chateau Mouton d’Armailhacq which is also owned by the Roths-
1.50 child family. Here too, careful vinification and exceptional skill have created soft, pleasing Clarets of character and distinction.

By and large, the 1937 Chateau bottled Clarets are the hardest to obtain and the most sought after. Because of the unusual

Case

> 13 amount of tannin which they contain, they are slow in maturing. For example, this one is just coming into its own and demon-
ori strates its true greatness when served today. It probably will remain a great wine for at least another 10 years. In our opinion,

sell for twice the price.

1.93 These St. Emilion wines are generally more full bodied than those produced in the townships of Medoc. Clos Fourtet 1937 is
a classic Claret which demonstrates the highest point that a good St. Emilion can achieve. Though it’s ready for drinking now,
it has many good years ahead of it. Formerly sold at $4.44. We strongly advise that you acquire a case or two at this unbelievable
low price.
