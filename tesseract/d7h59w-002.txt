By Our Associate Sam Aaron

Writter enroute during his January Visit

To London and the Vineyards of Bordeaux

Burgundy and Champagne

I was accompanied on this tasting by
the Marquis d’Angerville, an outstand-
ing vineyard owner in his own right,
who agreed with me that the Ramonet
62s are extraordinary, and should be
drunk within the next few years. The
’6ls are perfectly balanced. They have
all the elements for a long life, and rep-
resent an excellent wine to lay down.
The ’63s are a pleasant exception to the
rule for this year, which is being pre-
maturely labelled a disaster, despite the
presence of some real classics, such as
this one. Don’t buy by the numbers:
there will be some good things bearing
the date 19631

White Burgundies like Ramonets’
are likely to be good in 1963. Nature
turned some of the grapes into raisins,
and this accounts for the spicy, rich,
fruity quality that some of these wines
have. My own advice, after on-the-spot
tasting, is to grab a Ramonet Chassagne-
Montrachet (’61, 62 or ’63) with such
vineyard appellations as ‘“Ruchottes” or
“Caillerets” on the label. It will be half
the price of the more famous Mon-
trachet, but will stand up to it quite
well, and in some cases even surpass it!

Every wine is different, and every
wine grower is different too. Individu-
ality, one might say, is almost cultivated
as much in their lives as in their wines,
and one finds no conformity here! The
Ramonets, for example, lead a simple

provincial life, full of good cooking and
solid comfort (although, it must be
admitted, television has at last invaded
their household). The Prince de Mer-
ode, whom I saw next, leads quite a
different life: he has a XVth Century
chateau, beautifully furnished and sur-
rounded by a moat. The cousin of King
Baudoin of Belgium, Prince de Merode
is the dean of Corton growers.

His Corton ’59 has a perfect harmony
and fullness, and can be drunk now;
his ’61s should be put away for four to
five years, until they have reached ma-
turity; his ’62s will be a delight two
years from now. As for his ’63s, I tasted
them from five different barrels, and I
can once again say that the much vilified
1963 has produced yet another excep-
tion. These are fine wines, the ’63
Cortons, and worth keeping in mind.

The d’Angervilles family is one of
the great old landowners of the area,
and their Volnay is justly famous. They
are not alone in the antiquity of their
holdings: more than ninety per-cent of
the Volnay vineyards have remained in
the same hands since the French Revo-
lution, and some of the holdings go back
far beyond.

When we dined at the d’Angervilles
chateau, we were, in effect, drinking
history (for wine is so much a part of
France’s history and greatness). We
drank the wines that the present mar-

quis had produced, followed by those of
his father—and finally, with the cheese,
we were honored by tasting the wines
grown by his grandfather!

d’Angerville’s Volnay Champans ’61
is a Great wine! It will live at least
ten more years, and while none remains
in the marquis’ cellars, Sherry is lucky
enough to have forty cases left, and who-
ever buys them will have a rare and
unique pleasure.

A new generation of growers Is rep-
resented by Pierre Matrot: he is more
scientifically oriented than his elders.
All growers tend to treat their wines as
if they were children, but while the
older growers are doting parents, Me-
trot tends to be more like a brilliant
obstetrician. His Meursaults are gener-
ally fresher than those of his neighbors
because he bottles them earlier. His
Matrot Bourgogne Aligote Blanc, ’62,
is clean, crisp and dry—remarkably so,
in fact. It will be in New York in April,
at $21.95 the case. It is, by the way, a
wine to be drunk immediately, so take
advantage of it!

What was the best thing that hap-
pened to me on this quick, flying trip of
inspection and pleasure? Why, to be
sure, the 75th pre-birthday celebration
of Henri Gouges, elder statesman of the
Cote d’Or, the man who labored to set
up rational label control in Burgundy!
I arrived to share in the festivities,
which took place in the true Burgun-
dian spirit (if you will forgive a pun).
Our dinner had eight courses and we
drank ten (TEN!) Nuits St-Georges,
ranging from a venerable and distin-
guished ’29 to a youthful ’61. What a
meal! It reminded me of the days of
Talleyrand, when course followed
course, and wine followed wine, and I
am afraid our New World dinners
seem like light snacks by comparison.
