drink has been HARVEY’S BRISTOL
CREAM (6.75).—Ironically, this year its
chief competitor is HARVEY’S TICO—
light-as-air, pale, dry—in keeping with
the times. (33.97 case) 2.98

Blended Scotch BES’

‘“16B.” JAMES BOSWELL was one of Scot-
land’s noblest products — and so is this
scotch (5.49). He wrote about SAMUEL
JOHNSON, who revered gocd brandy. It is
fitting that this fine Cognac should carry the
‘Good Doctor’s’ name. (6.49)

 

16D.” In the quest for lightness, gin-
drinkers turn to vodka, the color of
scotch and vermouth almost approach
that of water, and now for the first time
a great Champagne house has cre-
ated KRUG LIGHT. (70.09 case) 6.49

‘16G.” From Japan come two roman-
tic, astonishingly good liqueurs
CHERRY BLOSSOM and GREEN
TEA. Perfect for sipping while study-
ing Zen.

‘“16E.”’ The search for lightness contin-
ues. Here is NOILLY PRAT, France’s
most famed dry vermouth. It will not cast
a shadow in the martini-glass, nor be any
darker than the ice-cubes in your ver-
mouth-on-the-rocks. (29.19 case) 2.65

“16H.” “Sack’’—a term immortalized by
Shakespeare. DRY SACK—a sherry pop-
ularized in England and America—partic-
ularly “‘on-the-rocks.”’ (magnum 9.90) 4.95

“16C.” BEAM’S BONDED Bour-
BON costs 6.70 in its ordinary bot-
tle. We suppose that this pyrex
coffee-server might cost about 4.00
in your local hardware store. The
cost of both is not 10.70, as you
might suspect—but only 6.70

 

“16F.” Louis XIV loved Cham-
pagne, made his whole court drink
it for ‘“‘stomach’s sake,” and this
is a replica of the bottle which he
used. LAURENT PERRIER 1953 is
a giant among Champagnes, is ex-
pensive, but worth it. (733.92 case)

“16J.”’ Scotland is famed for cas-
tles, heather, Scotch, and Bonnie
Prince Charlie—the man who in-
spired the mystic, secret-formula
liqueur, lovingly known throughout
the world as DRAMBUIE. (ha/f-bot-
tle 5.00). 9.69
