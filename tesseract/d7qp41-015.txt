LL—OLDEST COLLEGE
Y OF OXFORD

These wines and spirits proudly bear the name of St. Edmund Hall, one of
the 32 independent institutions of learning which, collectively, comprise
the University of Oxford. St. Edmund Hall, which can be identified on the
ancient map above (1713), dates its origin back to the 13th Century.
Some of you may have seen St. Edmund Hall’s medieval library which ap-
peared so prominently in the recent film “Accident.” It is with no small
sense of pride that we offer these carefully selected wines and spirits to the
discriminating drinkers of New York.
