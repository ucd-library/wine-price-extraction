“20-A” From Portugal.
Delightful MATEUS pink
wine in the flat, pear-
shaped bottle. One of
the most popular on the
Continent, clear color,
subtle bouquet and re-
freshing lightness. Ex-
cellent Vin Rose. (21.49
case) 1.99

“20-B” We like the homey description A
FAMILY WINE CELLAR which identifies
this handsome five bottle assortment in a
useful carry-all that features the map of
Paris. The bottles are Medoc, Sauternes,
Graves, Beaujolais and Tavel. Each is
selected by that eminent wine authority,
PETER SICHEL. The total cost for the
carry-all, including five bottles is 13.87

“21-A” Splits in a box. CHARLES HEID-
SIECK BRUT is one of the world’s great
Champagnes. They happily sent us their
handsome gift box (no extra charge)
holding 6 splits (1.99)—complete 11.94.

**21-B’? PERNOD-—as
French as ‘Boeuf Bour-
guignonne’, Montmartre,
and the Bal Musette —
will please your Franco-
phile friends.

**21-E’’ The superb
CHERRY MARNIER
comes in its rich velour-
covered bottle; one of
the best cherry liqueurs
of Europe.

“21-C” An “entente cordiale”
for this post-war period can
hardly be found in_ interna-
tional relations. But it can be
found in the field of liqueurs —
the happy alliance of ‘‘Bene-
dictine & Brandy” — better
known as B & B.

“91-F” The search for light-
ness continues. Here is NOIL-
LY PRAT, France’s most famed
dry vermouth. It will not cast a
shadow in the martini-glass,
nor be any darker than the ice-

vermouth-on-

cubes in your

the-rocks. (29.05 case)
