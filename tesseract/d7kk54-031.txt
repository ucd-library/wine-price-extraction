 

1976 RHINES & MOSELLES

1975 and 1976 are among the finest vintages in German history. This means
for devotees of the richer, sweeter German style -- those who cherish a full
Spatlese or lucious Auslese -- the '75s and '/6s are your last opportunity for

 

 

quite a while. In short supply and irreplaceble, we recommend you buy now!
