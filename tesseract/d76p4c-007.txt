 

Rarely has any spirit captured the enthusiasm of the
American public as has BEEFEATER ENGLISH GIN.
Only two decades ago, the name was primarily asso-
ciated with a beautifully uniformed guard protecting
the Tower of London and other historic monuments.
Now, should you stop the nearest passer-by and ask
him the meaning of ‘Beefeater; he will respond with
‘the best gin in the world? We suspect future diction-
aries will record this fact. If you have a friend who likes
gin, can you think of a better gift to send him than a
few bottles of BEEFEATER?

Pale, relatively dry, LILLET
is the most sophisticated
of aperitifs—particularly
when served with a thin
sliver of orange peel added.

Taittinger is not one of the largest
producers of Champagne. It is just
one of the best. And oh, the remark-
able wines this old family grows.
The highest expression of their re-
nowned wine-making talent is held
in this graceful antique-style bottle.
Only individually selected clusters
of perfect Chardonnay grapes may
become part of this brilliant wine,
the favorite of many French gastro-
nomes. An inspired gift to send your
Champagne-loving friends.

Suntory Royal is produced
in Kyoto’s lush green Vale
of Yamazaki, famous for
its even climate and soft
artesian water. Like the
great whiskies of Scotland,
it is the product of fine malt
whiskies distilled in copper
pot stills. Intriguing—@"
unusual gift. (139.65 case)
