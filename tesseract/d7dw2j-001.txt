—AnInspired ea!

Let us embark on a money-saving wine Odyssey
through the great vineyards of France and Germany.
To assist in this joyous adventure, we have selected
only the best examples from each of these wine-
crowing areas. In addition, we have made certain that
every selection represents not simply good value—but
outstanding, money-saving value. For evidence, you
need simply compare these prices to those prevailing
at other wine shops in the New York area.

All of these wines have passed the critical test of our
wine-tasting panel which consists of James Beard,
Clifton Fadiman, Michael Aaron and Sam Aaron.

To A Festive Summer Season!

LET OUR VALUES FOLLOW YOU THIS SUMMER

There is no delivery too difficult for our shipping department.
They have been known to deliver to eager clientele rocking in
hammocks on the lawn; some patrons have been chased by
speed boats as their ship pulled out of Montauk Harbor; and
some deliveries were made to the twenty-second floor of an
apartment house during an elevator breakdown.

THE JAMES BEARD WINE RACK

James Beard knows his wine as well as his food. He devised
this wine rack and it handsomely adorns his kitchen and dining
room. It can also play an important part in your home—the
racks stack ‘one-on-the-other.’

You might even consider sending one filled with twelve wines
of your selection to an appreciative, wine-loving friend. The
cost is wonderfully low. Add only $9.95 for the James Beard
Wine Rack. (Each rack requires purchase of 12 bottles.)
