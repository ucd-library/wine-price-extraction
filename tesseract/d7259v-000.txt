SHERRY wine «

SPIRITS CO. Inc.

Perhaps the most agreeable fashion in
which we can greet the advent of
Autumn is by alerting you to some of
our “‘favorites’’—those bottles in our
century-old cellars that we consider
particularly notable—bottles that can
bring added pleasure to Fall living.
Those chosen here are worthy repre-
sentatives of their class—honest values
—and, in many instances—-exceptional

bargains.
