tual encyclopedia of wine and a compendium
of wine lore as well. It is as useful as a wine
rack, as enjoyable as a vintage Bordeaux. It
wraps, in a word, everything you ever wanted
to know about wine into one glorious volume.

mixed case of stories, humorous essays,
poems and quotations that illuminate the
long connection between wine and civili-
zation.
