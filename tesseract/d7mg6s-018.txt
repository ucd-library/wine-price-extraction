From the Last Centur y ‘Bury

MADEIRA

We quote from James Beard, one of Amer-
ica’s outstanding authorities on wine and
food, “The very existence, let alone the
sheer perfection of this 1805, is an historic
wine event—these 19th Century Madeiras
have provided one of the great wine tast-
ing experiences of my life.”

When these are gone, the opportunity to
taste authentic 19th Century Vintage
Madeira of this calibre will be lost forever.
