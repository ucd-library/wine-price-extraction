 

THE HIGHLY REGARDED BURGUNDIES

OF
JOSEPH DROUHIN

When the name of the 18th Century wine house of Joseph Drouhin is mentioned to native
Burgundians, the feeling of respect and admiration that they display is a faba
It becomes quite obvious, even to the wine merchant who makes an annua ve of t p
vineyards, that no wine maker in France enjoysa higher reputation for quality, auth enticity
and continuous devotion to the highest standards of wine-growing and wine-making.

We can only urge you, when next in Burgundy, that you visit Drouhin’s remarkable cellars
next to the palace of the Dukes of Burgundy. Their origins can be traced to the Middle Ages,
The cellars have been classified as an historic monument by France.

This offering is no minor event for the wine lovers of New York. At best, the Drouhin
wines are produced in small quantity, are hard to come by, and generally are among the
most costly Burgundies available. This reserve offering is truly dramatic. You can now
acquire the great 1964 Burgundies of Joseph Drouhin at 25% below the present prices
that prevail in New York for his 1962s — and the savings would be even greater if you
compare these prices to what the ’64s will ultimately fetch!

Robert Drouhin, to make certain that no adversity shall beset his beloved wine from the
first tentative shoots until it reaches the wine drinker in New York, has appointed as his
importer for the United States, Mr. Michel L. Dreyfus. Mr. Dreyfus shares this love of wine
with Drouhin for he has devoted a half-century of his life to visiting the vineyards and
tasting wines, As testimony to his unique mastership in this field, he has been appointed
(no small honor) Grand Officier, or Chief Executive of the New York Chapter of the Confrerie
des Chevaliers du Tastevin.
