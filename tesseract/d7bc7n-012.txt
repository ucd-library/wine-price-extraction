There is more vineyard land in Spain than in any other
country in the world—less than 3% is Sherry. The best
table wines are from Rioja and some good ones are pro-
duced in Valdepenas—also spottily in a few other prov-
inces. Look for the old vintage wines of Rioja which are
among the best values in outstanding red wine extant
today.
