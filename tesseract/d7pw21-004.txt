The S.S. France Steaming Into the New York Harbor on February 8th

The glory of French prestige and accomplishment is magnificently symbolized by
the graceful new liner, $.$. France. When at sea, man’s culture is expressed by
gracious living, good food, good wine and delightful surroundings, and reaches its
highest expression aboard this noble vessel.

In its own small way, the Muscadet Orfeuilles 1961, which appropriately travelled to
New York aboard the S.S. France, represents another aspect of the achievement of
this remarkable nation. The distinguishing characteristics of this simple, dry, young
wine of the Loire Valley are its direct, unpretentious honesty, and its favorable
French soil which has produced similar wines for centuries. It is no more pretentious
than the good bread of Paris, the cheeses of the countryside, the butter of Normandy,
and noble fruit of the Loire. A bottle costs but 1.69—and a whole case is but 18.50—
and there are half bottles too, at 20.50 the case.
