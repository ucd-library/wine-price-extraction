1964 MOSELLE WINES ON SALE

oselles

Years!

Here is an extraordinary opportunity to acquire the
great wines of the Moselle and Rhine at savings up
to 50% below the current market. Choose among
such world-famous growers as Dr. H. Thanisch, Egon
Muller, Joh. Jos. Prum, von Kesselstatt, von Schu-
bert, Staatsdomaine, Prince von Metternich and
Graf Matuschka.

Here are the two great years of the last decade — the
long-lived 59s and sprightly 64s. Since many of these
wines will surely be depleted rapidly, and are irre-
placeable at these prices, we advise ordering early
and anticipating your Spring and Summer require-

ments now.

the best single wine produced in the township of Graach.

tasted.

of Wehlen, plus the name of Prum, is what an astrologer
would call a favorable combination.” Here is his great
Auslese.

selles. The favorite of the industrial leaders of Germany.
