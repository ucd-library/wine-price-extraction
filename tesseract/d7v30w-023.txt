 

e at Sherry-Lehmann take the good wines of
America very seriously. The long list of California's
best vineyards that appears below should provide
ample testimony. After many visits to American
vineyards, many blind tastings of American versus European
wines, and after more than 50 years of experience as wine
merchants, we are prepared to say that this may be the most
select list of California wines available in this country.

In a recent issue of The Wine Advocate Robert Parker
singled out twenty-four of California’s hottest wineries. We
happily report that all 24 appear below! In addition to these
selected two dozen, many of the other great vineyards of
California are presented here. This is of particular significance
to the admirer of American wines—we question whether
there is another wine merchant in the United States (with the
possible exception of California) that can boast of such a wide
selection of the best.

“CALIFORNIA’S
HOTTEST WINERIES”

Twenty-four California vineyards were selected by
Robert Parker in a recent issue of The Wine Advocate as
being California's hottest. These vineyards are listed below:

Boony Doon

Calera Kalin

Carmenet Kistler

Caymus Vineyards Laurel Glen Vineyard

Chateau Montelena Matanzas Creek Winery

Diamond Creek Vineyards Monticello Cellars

Dominus Joseph Phelps Vineyards
(The John Daniel Society) Ravenswood

Dunn Vineyards Ridge Vineyards

Forman St. Francis Winery

Girard Winery Silver Oak Cellars

Groth Winery Spottswoode Wine

La Jota Vineyard Stag’s Leap Wine Cellars

This noble red wine grape yields remarkable and long-lived
reds in California, just as it does in Bordeaux. We have made a
careful selection from among America’s best Cabernet
Sauvignons—and they are all attractively priced.

The miracle was repeated
with this Daniel Estate
Cabernet Sauvignon. Here
again, it was Christian
Moueix who supervised
the making of the wine.

heritage traces back to the original Captain Gustave-

acquisition. (1084)
