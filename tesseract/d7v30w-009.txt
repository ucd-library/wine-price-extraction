‘85s and '86s may offer a comparable experience. The ‘85s
are richly colored, precociously gracious, full of fruit and
structured with soft tannins which will preserve the wines
without forbidding their near-term enjoyment. The ’86s

STRATEGY FOR BUYING ’85s & ’86s:

Wise Bordeaux collectors are aware that the charming,
delightful ’85s will reach their maturity well before the
slow developing, classically great 1986 vintage. There-
e fore, many of our clientele have devoted a portion of
aie on their cellar to the 1985s which can be consumed soon
