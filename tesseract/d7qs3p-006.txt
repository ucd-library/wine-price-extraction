This is the time of the year when one looks for
a truly fine bottle of Cognac to give to a connois-
seur friend or to serve as a fitting climax to the
holiday dinner party. A Cognac of such pedigree
has just reached our cellars. Last year the world-
famous Cognac firm of Courvoisier released
below 300 bottles of their “Special Grand Fine
Champagne Cognac” and it was gone in less than
a month. This year Courvoisier has shipped a
similar quantity—-so we urge those seeking the
best in Brandy act quickly to avoid disappoint-
ment due to depletion. Each bottle is numbered,
and its gold-engraved label describes its rarity
and pedigree. We have tasted this Cognac, which
dates back to the 19th century, and can report

that its delicacy, bouquet and finesse are truly

remarkable.
