BEAUJOLAIS

[In a certain village of Beaujolais, as
you enter, you will see a sign that
reads, ‘“‘la mendicité est interdite
dans la commune.” Translated, this
reads “begging is forbidden in this
commune.’’ We could not quite
understand its meaning, since it
seemed dubious that the good citi-
zens of this prosperous town ever
needed to beg—but the sign had evi
dently been there for decades. And
this year, it suddenly becomes rele-
vant. 800,000 hectolitres were sold
before the crop, and the low yield of
the harvest confounded everyone be-
cause only 700,000 were gathered!
The shippers, committed to sell,
learned of the low yield—they in-
vaded the cellars of the growers to
cover their advance commitments.
The price went up 30% almost im-
mediately—and they have now gone
up another 30%. And even now, in
mid-June, wine buyers from every-
where can be seen scouring Beaujo-
lais, begging from door-to-door, in
search of their share of the suddenly
precious red wine of this region.

The quality of the 1969 Beaujolais
is beyond reproach. The wines have
excellent color and a firmness that
has made them more adaptable to
export. They are entirely typical;
the rich purple-red robe is apparent;
the fruit is there; you will detect a
full measure of bouquet—and no one
in the wine trade questions their
charm and balance.

 

The cellar-master at Chateau G1 eysac
is sufficiently enthusiastic about his
1969 to proclaim it the best year he has

broug ht iN.

POUILLY-FUISSE

As in Beaujolais, the Pouilly-Fuissé
crop is generally sold within the
year and virtually no older vintages
remain, either in the hands of grow-
ers or shippers. For some unknown
reason, despite the difficulty in pro-
nouncing the name, a large propor-
tion of Pouilly-Fuissé ends up in the
United States. Considering that
there are 200 million people in the
United States, and Pouilly-Fuissé
produces for the entire world only
250,000 cases, the inevitable result,
in light of the excellence of 1969, is
that the prices opened 50% higher
