WHITE BURGUNDY

THE GREAT 1976 MEURSAULTS

Here is what Frank Schoonmaker said about the great wines of
Meursault...."Even the lesser Meursaults are white Burgundies
of high quality and real distinction. The finer ones are sur-
passed by only a few great rarities among the dry white wines
of France." We offer here a choice selection of some of the
best Meursaults of the great 1976 vintage - aii are excellent.

fared better and produced many excellent wines.
