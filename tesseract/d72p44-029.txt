WINES OF AMERICA

American Wines have now become of age and we are proud of
what is produced within our borders—we take them seriously.
Perhaps we have not yet achieved a Chateau Lafite-Rothschild,
a Montrachet or a Musigny, but we are well on our way. It
may take another generation, but knowledge, dedication, trial-
and-error will move us closer to the ultimate of perfection.

In the interval, it is our responsibility to bring you the best of
northern California and New York State. Each wine listed
below has been tasted intrinsically and comparatively.
