ARMAGNAL

Remarkably fine example of French Armagnac
Brandy in Antique Glass Decanter. The bottle is
giant size with a solid glass center around which the
Brandy flows. A most intriguing bottle that is now be-
ing featured in curio shops of Paris.

Messrs. Hine have used their oldest reserve Cognac
to fill this exquisitely beautiful Baccarat Decanter.
The man will be poetic about the Cognac, the woman
will be eternally grateful for the beautiful Decanter.

We consider this the greatest single bottle gift avail-
able. Superb “30 year Old” Ballantine Scotch in a
glorious example of fine English Cut Crystal. Suggest

Ordering early since not many were shipped to
America.
