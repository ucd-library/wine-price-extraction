COTES DU RHONE ROUGE 1953 (Pont d’Avignon) . Value 1.06 y
“If you are on your way from Paris to the Riviera and you stop for lunch at one of the better restaurants of Avignon
and ask for the best wine of the country, this is the sort of heart-warming and cheering bottle you will get. If you are
looking for a sound, moderate priced wine to drink every day, I don’t know of any that I would recommend more
highly.” Frank Schoonmaker.

° J ° ° ° ) . ~ > \t1e fT ay 1t< a
Lighter, softer, and quicker maturing that its other Rhone Valley neighbors such as Cote Rotie and Hermitage, the
red Chateauneufs can be drunk and enjoyed when three years old. An entirely delightful wine at modest cost.

HERMITAGE, DES MOINES, 1953 (Chierfe) . . . . 2.79 2.49 27.95

If one were looking for the ‘Chambertin’ or ‘Clos Vougeot’ of the Rhone Valley, we think you would find it here at
the ‘Moines’ vineyard. Like the famed growths of Burgundy, the production is small, but the depth of es and
bouquet is remarkable. Here is the kind of wine that should be laid down and enjoyed as a truly ‘great bottle’ two
or three years hence.
