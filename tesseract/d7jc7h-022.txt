RED WINES

261 BEAUNE, CLOS DES MOUCHES 1953
Estate Bottled, Duvault-Blochet
The Clos des Mouches vineyard is directly adjacent to the
boundary of Pommard and produces a distinguished red
Burgundy — “tres eclegant’’ — says the local growers.

347 MEURSAULT CHARMES 1953
Estate Bottled, Joseph Matrot

One of the pleasantest Meursaults we have run across. i

685 CHABLIS VAUDESIR 1955 |
Estate Bottled, Louis Begue
Perhaps the most famous of the 8 Grand Cru vineyards of
Chablis is that of Vaudesir. Here is a perfect expression
produced during an outstanding year. |

RHINE & PFALZ WINES

523 RUDESHEIMER ROTTLAND
SPATLESE 1953
Estate Bottled, Staatsweingut
A magnificent Rheingau that refle
ciated with this great year.

564 FORSTER JESUITENGARTEN
1955, Estate Bottled, Bassermann-Jordan
The Jesuitengarten vineyard of the Pfalz is rated as the
most valuable agricultural land in Germany. A tare wine
with great elegance.

 

 

 

 

     
 
    

The glories of Burgundy, the
Rhine and Bordeaux are well rep-
resented here. Each of these is
an Estate bottled jewel, hard to
come by, and represent top flight

RED WINES

  

207 NUITS ST. GEORGES ARGILLIERES
1953, Estate Bottled, General Gouachon

Monsieur Gouachon, a retired French Army General, is
the proud producer of this extraordinary fine 1953 Nuits
St. Georges.

292 BONNES MARES 1953
Estate Bottled, Claire-Dau
In Chambolle, there are two really great vineyards —
Musigny and Bonnes Mares. Like Musigny, this has a
glorious perfume and a lingering bouquet.

667 CLOS DE LA ROCHE 1952
Estate Bottled, Jacques

Some of the greatest wines of Burgundy are produced in
the township of Morey from whence comes this remark-
able Clos de la Roche. Sturdy, full — a big wine.

381 GEVREY-CHAMBERTIN, COMBE
AUX MOINES, 1953
Estate Bottled, J. Beaudot

A tremendous wine of great depth, vigor and balance.

612 CHATEAU LYNCH BAGES 1949
The better clarets of 1949 have long disappeared from the
Bordeaux market. Here is a beautiful survivor being
offered at exceptionally low cost.

WHITE WINES

539 SCHLOSS VOLLRADS CABINET 1953
Estate Bottled, Graf Matuschka-Greiffenclau
In great years, the wines of Schloss Vollrads are among
the greatest of Germany. The title “‘Cabinet”’ is not given
lightly here — it means the best of class and extraordinary
wine of great distinction.

308 BATARD MONTRACHET 1955
Estate Bottled, J. Bavard

Though quite in a class with Montrachet itself, the Batard
is not quite as fabulously expensive. A beautiful 1955.
