97 ST. MIGHEL BRUT {Finger LakesiN 43 2 ee) 2.79 31.50

The American Champagnes produced in the Finger Lakes district of New York State generally command over $4.00 the bottle. We
will match this one, beautifully made and delightfully dry, with any of them, and at only $2.79. With the cost as low as this, you
can serve Champagne with the same carefree abandon generally reserved for Bourbon or Scotch.

81 BOYER BRUT 1959 (Haut-Savoie).. wi 3.49 39.75

If you do not insist that your French sparkling wine needs the appellation “Champagne,” here is the wine you should drink. They
learned their trade in the Champagne district, carried their craft to the French alps, grew the excellent local grape varieties and
proceeded to make a dry French sparkling wine that your friends and you will really enjoy. It is dry, of delicacy and finesse and
eminently satisfying.

39 PAUL DURANY BRUT ENGLIS CUVC.... 2. 3.99 46.75

We know of no French Champagne that can match this one in low cost, combined with balance, dryness and excellence in bouquet
and flavor.

30 MARCEL PERE ET FILS BRUT -195¢.....--... 4.59 50.25

An astonishing Champagne opportunity. Made of selected grapes gathered during the great 1959 harvest. The wine is completely
dry, surprisingly good and sensationally priced. Half bottles are available at $2.59 each; $54.75 the case of 24—and Magnums at
$9.59 each; $52.25 the case.

155 AYALA GOLD’ LABEL BEUT"Hit 3 4.99 56.50

We have just returned from Europe and we saw this wine listed everywhere we went in Paris and London. Although it is highly
respected in Europe, it is not that well-known here. This makes it possible for you to drink truly fine Champagne at this astonishingly
low cost. Half bottles also available at $2.79 each; $60.00 the case.

Gilbert Lejeune, until recently the Maitre d’ of the Three Star Lasserre Restaurant in Paris, has spent the last two years transform-
ing the LEDOYEN, located on the Champs Elysees into the most beautiful luxurious restaurant of all Paris. A native of the Cham-
pagne, Mr. Lejeune takes his wine seriously. He has chosen what he considers the best of Champagne to bear the name of this
gastronomic shrine. Enjoy it at the LEDOYEN when you are in Paris—order it from Sherry’s when you are back home.

31 LOUIS. ROEDERER GOUR.ROYVALE BRUI ts 6.98 75.50

Here is one of the best non-vintage Champagnes we have ever tasted. It is a remarkable blend of the light and elegant 1960's, combined
with the wonderful, fruity Cuvee of the 1959. Though there is no vintage date on the label, here is a wine that will rival and equal
even the better of the vintage Champagnes. Specially priced at $6.98. Also available in half bottles at $3.75 each, and in Splits at $1.97.

beautiful harmony of this great wine remains undiminished until today with several excellent years still ahead of it. Fabulous as a
unique holiday gift. Quantity limited. i
