STORING THE WINES:- We quote from a recent article written by one of our associates for
Town & Country Magazine, "I have seen some of the noblest collections of wine stored happily
in their original cases, on do-it-yourself shelves, wine racks acquired in Department stores, and
in handsome, beautifully designed cabinets. The setting for wine storage depends on the wine
budget and decorative taste, but has little to do with what happens inside the bottle".

The article continues and comments on storage temperature for wine in the following realistic
fashion, "The kind of surroundings you provide for these bottles is but a personal decision that
has very little to do with how the wine thrives and develops. It is obvious that a wine should
not be stored next to a roaring furnace or exposed to the winter winds. Not even the heartiest
of men would like such conditions. The temperature should not be permitted to drop much below
50 or soar much above 70 (if you seek perfection and immortality for the wines, install air
conditioning, but it is not necessary) ."

WINE GLASSES:- Avoid thimble size wine glasses - it does not bring out the best in wine. The
investment in generous 10 ounce, clear tulip-shaped stemmed glassware, provides many dividends -
it permits you to appraise clarity and color; it permits the bouquet to express itself fully; and,
since smell effects taste, the wine will taste better. Many Department stores feature - and at
reasonable cost - the handsome, suftable Frank Schoonmaker's All-Purpose wine glasses - a glass
designed to bring out the best in Champagne, red wine, pink wine and white wine. Even your
Scotch and Sodas will taste better in such a glass.

CORKSCREW:=- A $2.00 investment in the efficient, handy folding bartender's corkscrew, with

knife to cut the foil and workable screw, will avoid difficulty in extracting the cork. Available

everywhere.
