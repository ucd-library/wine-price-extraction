We quote from James Beard, one of Amer-
ica’s outstanding authorities on wine and
food, *
sheer perfection of this 1805, is an historic
wine event—these 19th Century Madeiras
have provided one of the great wine tast-
ing experiences of my life.”

When these are gone, the opportunity to
taste authentic 19th Century Vintage
Madeira of this calibre will be lost forever.
