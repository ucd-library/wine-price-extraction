122—-CHATEAU GLORIA 1964 Pemex

Normally sells for over $4.00. In our opinion,
the equal of any vineyard of the St. Julien
district—the proud property of Henri
Martin, the Mayor of St. Julien. Fullness
with delicacy. Great future. On sale at

381—CHATEAU
BOUSCAUT 1964.

We quote Cyril Ray in the Lon-
don Observer, “Chateau Bous-
caut is a fine, full-bodied, yet
far from heavy wine... typical
of red Graves in developing
more quickly than a compar-
able Medoc yet lasting as long.”
$3.49 bottle $37.80 case

 

334—CHATEAU
DASSAULT 1964

A superb St. Emilion vineyard
owned by Marcel Dassault,
famed creator of the Mirage
and the Mystere (known as the
Falcon Jet here). His pride and
dedication has yielded a big,
round, outstanding wine, rich
in fruit, destined to live long.
$2.99 bottle $32.30 case

 

723—CHATEAU
HAUT BRION 1964

Considered by many experts as
the best Claret produced in
1964. Perfect harvest weather
and early picking achieved the
perfection. Commands almost
$100.00 the case in Bordeaux.
Will go up further. Due to
early large quantity buying, we
offer it on sale below todays
market price.
