NOILLY PRAT

We all know the excellence of NOILLY PRAT Extra Dry
Vermouth from France—and now France sends us, for
the first time, the superb Noilly Prat Sweet Vermouth.
Noilly Prat is the classic dry French Vermouth by which
all other Vermouths are judged. It is pale, extra dry, of
impeccable origin, and renowned through the world. It is
the ideal companion for the Dry Martini—also excellent
on-the-rocks with a twist of lemon peel.

Its delightful counterpart-Noilly Prat Sweet Vermouth
from France—is now available. You will be delighted with
its fruity richness and beautiful balance. (36.18 case)

HENNESSY
BRAS ARME

We stopped 472 people on
the street and said ‘HEN-
NESSY’. They all immedi-
ately responded ‘COGNAC’.
This provided us with incon-
testable evidence that Hen-
nessy is synonymous with
Cognac, the best known and
most appreciated of all.
Hence a wise selection as a
gift. Quality, reputation, and
appearance all are superb.
