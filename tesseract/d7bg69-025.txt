The author of this classic work, Frank Schoonmaker, visits
the Moselle and the Rhine twice a year, annually tasting
an over 1,500 different wines. He knows the vineyards, cellars
mor and producers as no one else does — tasting barrel by
CCl ive barrel, he buys only what he considers BEST OF CLASS.
For the past three years he has accumulated, in Germany,
an extraordinary reserve of outstanding wines bought
directly from the growers who have become his close
friends and who favor him with the best barrels in their
cellars — from whence come these outstanding wines.

 
  
 

Here is an extraordinary opportunity for those fond of truly
fine German wine to acquire these “Personal Reserve
Wines” at a cost that can be conservatively estimated as
30% BELOW THE CURRENT MARKET.
