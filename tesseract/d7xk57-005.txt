UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY
FOR CLARET LOVERS

Sparked by the hysteria that surrounds the
1959 vintage and a dramatic increase in the
world demand for the great wines of Bor-
deaux, prices at the vineyards continue to
march up substantially. Despite this, we have
priced our clarets to reflect our original costs
and not what the present market should dic.
tate. As our inventory becomes depleted, we
will, of course, be forced to reflect the re-
placement prices which will be much higher.
As of now, we do think it would be wise to
anticipate your red Bordeaux requirements
right into the Fall and avail yourselves of
these unique values.
