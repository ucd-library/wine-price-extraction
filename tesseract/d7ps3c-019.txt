“Bordeaux

 

One of the great of our generation. Rich in fruit and charm, these wines have matured relatively
. All are great attractiveness even for present drinking, but we do believe a year or two
more of bottle age will a reward to the more patient wine drinker, particularly when the great

vineyards are involved. The price level of these wines are relatively stabilized in relation to the ’59s, "61s
and '62s, which are dramatically soaring on the market place of Bordeaux. However, all evidence
indicates that the ’64s will go up substantially during the latter part of 1963.
