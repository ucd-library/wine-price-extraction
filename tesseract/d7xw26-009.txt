14 Year Old Bourbon

The number of barrels of fine, 14 year old
whiskey in existence is necessarily limited be-
cause of the serious loss through evaporation
usually over 50% during the 14 long years
of maturation. Made ata small coun-

A Rarity-Old-Fashioned Straight Rye That is

Hardly Seen Anymore
Anderson Club Straight 8 Year Old Rye

When your guests ask for Rye, what do
you give them? Some offer an American
blended Whiskey; others believe Rye is
synonymous with Canadian blended
Whiskey; and there are some that give it
no further thought and simply provide
whatever American Whiskey is in the
house, including Bourbon. But there is
such a thing as Straight Unblended Rye.
It is not easy to come by, but is worth the
effort. It is what our fathers happily con-
sumed during Prohibition and during the
early days of Repeal. Straight Rye still
exists, and the best example we have run
across is ANDERSON CLUB 8 Year Old

Rye, distilled in Indiana, and bottled in
Anderson County, Kentucky.

Don't let the low price of below 4.99 dis-
courage you. You will discover a smooth
mellowness that is the by-product of the
time-honored and unhurried way in which
it is made. You will delight your grand-
father and even possibly your father, if
you send him several bottles of Straight
Rye that will nostalgically recapture rem-
