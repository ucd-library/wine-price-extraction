harsh -BALLANTINE’S adheres to
the Grecian precept of the ‘Golden
Mean.’ Had Pericles drunk Scotch,
this might have been his choice.

 

The superb
CHERRY MARNIER
comes in its rich velour-
covered bottle: one of
the best cherry liqueurs
of Europe,

Greece sends us its superb
METAXA GRANDE FINE BRANDY
in a glorious porcelain decanter
executed in classic Grecian style.
Very rare—only a few bottles avail-
able.
