e . , 5 BN e 99
The wines of the “Domaine de la Romaneée-Conti, he-

cause of their scarcity and magnificence, have always been
collector’s items among serious wine drinkers. We proudly
offer two fine vintage years of °56 and °99, both eminently
successful at the Domaine, and suggest acquisition betore

they disappear from the market.

A consistent favorite among our clientele — good depth and balance; rich in the typical Rhone Valley
flavor; exceptionally fine red wine at extraordinarily low cost.

420 CHATEAUNEUF DU PAPE 1955 (Clos des Felibres) . .2.19 24.50

This vineyard, one of the most remarkable and dramatic of France, towers high above the town
where one can hardly see soil because of the large rock boulders. It is generally conceded among the
citizens of Chateauneuf that the best wine of their district comes from this eagle’s nest vineyard. )2

364. HERMITAGE DES MOINES 1955 (Chierpe) . . . . .2.49 27.95 1

If one were looking for the ‘Chambertin’ or ‘Clos Vougeot’ of the Rhone Valley, we think you would

find it here at the ‘Moines’ vineyard. Like the famed growths of Burgundy, the production is small, .
but the depth of flavor and bouquet is remarkable. Here is the kind of wine that should be laid down
and enjoyed as a truly ‘great bottle’ two or three years hence.
