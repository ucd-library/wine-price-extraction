Many of you have gotten to know
James Beard through Sherry’s, or
by reading his informative books
and articles about food and wine.
It might interest you to know that
his new book *“*THE JAMES
BEARD COOK BOOK,” published
last month by Dell has become an
outstanding seller during its first
month of existence and for good
reason—over 500 pages, available
in a handsome paper back, and
priced at only 75¢ the copy. Critics
throughout the country have re-
viewed it in the most glowing terms.

Me CREE) THE SUNNY
SEASON with the largest and
most appealing collection of wines
and spirits thus far gathered in our
quarter-century of existence. I
know of no better way of being in
tune with June than leisurely en-
joying the bouquet and delicacy of
one of the extraordinary German
wines that you will find in Frank
Schoonmaker’s “Personal Reserve
Collection”; and if it is the greatest
Mint Julep devised by man that
you are seeking, no Bourbon would
quite equal the remarkable Johnny
Reb 12 Years Old which would
please the most exacting Ken-
tuckian; and if you are seeking to
add that bit of extra perfection to
your summer drinks, I suggest the
Fortnum & Mason’s Imported Gin
for the Tom Collins and the Bar-
bancourt Haitian Rum for your
rum drinks.

INTERESTING NEW
ARRIVALS: When in the Beau-
jolais district, I was delighted with
the cheerful, handsome 17 ounce
“POT” size bottle which was used
for tasting by the ruddy-faced
growers. I happily report that the
cheerful 1958 Beaujolais and
Pouilly Fuissé, the very wines they
are drinking there now, will be
arriving during mid-June—Alexis
Lichine has selected the best of the
district for us and they cost but
$1.49 each!

ENGLISH COUNTRYSIDE
LIVING never seemed more at-
tractive than during my recent
week-end visit with the Bulmer
family, Britain’s most famed Cider
makers. The tradition of gracious
dining was maintained — the first
salmon of the season from the Wye
Valley —the last of the season's
pheasant—a “raspberry fool,” lovely
in color and tender to the palate.
And throughout, of course, there
were several different ciders that
came from Bulmer’s magnificent
cellars. I was quite impressed by
how delightful cider can be—cer-
tainly different from wine, but an
excellent food companion in its
own right—refreshing, pleasing and
and an amusing change of pace.
Both in England and France, good
hard cider has been one of the ac-
cepted regional drinks for cen-
turies and has often played a part

June, the first shipment of Bul-

for anyone because it is a delicious
change for terrace dining, picnics,

A SOURCE OF AMAZEMENT:

Many of our customers who live
in Long Island, Westchester, Rock-
land or Orange Counties have ex-
pressed amazement over the speed
with which their orders reach
them. It is not infrequent to have
someone call us after five in the
evening, only to find the package
in their home, 40 miles away, the
following morning. The answer is
simple—these deliveries are made
for us by United Parcel Service —
which covers, with speedy  efh-
