France, one must look to Burgundy. We
herald the arrival of the young, fresh 1962s
and wax lyrical about the truly fabulous
1961s. True to type, beautifully balanced
with great finesse, they are destined to be
long-lived—at last white Burgundies that

*301 PINOT CHARDONNAY. . 1.59 17.50

Made from the traditional Burgundy grape, its green-gold color and refreshing
dryness will please you as much as its modest cost.

*289 PETIE CHABLIS =... ..~° 43,99. 21.95

Estate bottled, G. Gauthron

Nature blessed the Chablis district with a goodly quantity of fine wine in 1962.
Hence this low price. Very light, bone dry.

*819 BOURGOGNE ALIGOTE . 1.99 21.95
Estate bottled, Pierre Matrot

Nothing short of sensational! Here is a superb white Burgundy with all of the
characteristics of the district. The Aligote grape expressed in remarkable fashion.

#821 MEURSAULT... «+ 248-2750

Estate bottled, Joseph Matrot
During our recent visit to Burgundy, we were impressed by the skill and care

that Mr. Matrot bestowed upon his white Burgundies. Young, fresh, extra-
ordinary flavor.

*641 POUILLY-FUISSE.. ... 2.49 27.50

Estate bottled, Mathias
We tasted 15 different samples of Pouilly Fuisse before we selected this one.

From some of the best vineyard soil and many notches above the average
Pouilly Fuisse on the market.

336. POUILLY-FUGSE. .- 2. 2379 360.75
Estate bottled, Robert Dutron

Unusually great heights achieved by this exceptional 1962.

*362 CHABLIS VAUDESIR. . . 3.49 38.50

Estate bottled, Domaine Maladiere

Fine, light, racy — there are only 8 “grands cru” vineyards occupying 90 acres
and Vaudesir is one of them.

*369 MONTRACHET .... . $50 93.50
Estate bottled, Milan-Mathey

The tiny bit of soil called Le Montrachet produces what many believe to be the
greatest white wine on earth. The total area averages 1200 cases divided among
16 owners. Since much of it is sold to friends, little remains for the rest of the
world. And the 1962 is superb.

326 MEURSAULT <2 Lan ee

Estate bottled, Ampeau
The white wines of Meursault are only a shade less distinctive than Corton
Charlemagne and Montrachet. The distinguishing characteristics are dry, deli-
cate and with much perfume. Here is a good one.

335 MEURSAULT CHARMES . 3.979 41.75

Estate bottled, Ampeau

From one of the most magnificent vineyards of Meursauit. Good breed, good
texture, just coming into its own. Long line ahead.

*322 CHASSAGNE MONTRACHET,
LES RUCHOTTES. ... 3.99 43.95

Estate bottled, Claude Ramonet

We are prepared to defend our prejudice. After years of comparative tasting,
we believe that the ‘“‘Ruchottes”’ of Ramonet stands up against ‘“‘Le Montrachet”’
itself and actually surpasses many of them in finesse, bouquet and balance.

314 BIENVENUE BATARD
MONTRACHET. «. . .....4349 Gea:

Estate bottled, Sauzet

Only 6 acres of this earth’s surface is entitled to bear this vineyard name. Hard
to come by, just starting to show its virtue, brilliant future.

*343 MEURSAULT, CLOS DES
PERRIERES . .0:. ss” 4499 44.5;

Estate bottled, A. Grivault

Les perrieres is the best vineyard and heart of Meursault. It is the center, or
bull’s eye, a tiny plot bearing the name, ‘‘Clos des Perrieres.’? The Grivault
family gets as much for this wine as for Montrachet — it is worth it.

*351 BATARD MONTRACHET. 4.99 54.95

Estate bottled, C. Ramonet

Only a tiny lane separates this from ‘‘le Montrachet’’ itself. We were told in
Burgundy that the quality of the wine produced here, and the reputation of the
name, has made the land worth over $30,000 the acre — just as real estate.

*350 CORTON CHARLEMAGNE 5.49 60.50

Estate bottled, Dubreuil-Fontaine

Produced on the steepest hillside of Burgundy, this 1961 is remarkable in its
dramatic taste qualities. Promises many years of greatness.

655 CHEVALIER
MONTRACHET. .... . . 6.48 @iio0

Estate bottled, Lochardet
One of the great white wines of the world. Only a small quantity has reached us.
