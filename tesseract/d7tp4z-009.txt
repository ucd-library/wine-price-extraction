Impeccable examples of
estate-bottled and Chateau-
bottled thoroughbreds from
the great vineyards of France

VOLNAY, POUSSE D’OR, 1952

Estate bottled, Domaine Chavigne de Lavorielle
An outstanding red Burgundy of great class and depth, now
coming into its own.

CHATEAU LATOUR 1950

The 1950s are fine, supple wines that have developed even
better than anticip< ited. Here is a great vineyard, outstandingly
fine for present drinking.

CHATEAU HAUT BRION 1954

In a recent blind tasting, Haut Brion, from the Graves district,
proved to be the best of the 1954s presented. The wine is rela-
tively light, but not without power, and truly magnificent now.

CHATEAU COS D’ESTOURNEL 1948

From the best vineyard in St. Estephe comes this truly glorious
wine produced during a year that was not fashionable then be-

cause it was squeezed between 1947 and 1949. Slow to mature,

it now has sufficient bottle age to be considered outstanding

today.

NUITS ST. GEORGES, VAUCRAINS, 1957
Estate bottled by Henri Gouges

Deep, full bodied, excellent fruit and destined to be long lived.

MEURSAULT PERRIERES 1955

Estate bottled, Domaine Ampeau

A classic wine that clearly reveals the heights that can be
achieved by a fine Meursault vineyard during an outstanding
year.

CHASSAGNE MONTRACHET,
CAILLERETS, 1958

From one of the better vineyards of the Montri chet area—the
proud product of Mr. Ramonet. A remarkable price for a wine
of such outstanding origin and quality.
