FROM SWITZERLAND
12 YEAR OLD KIRSCH

Kirsch is a brandy
distilled from cher-
ries including the
stone. Since it is
stored in earthen-
ware, it does not
take on the color
that wood would
impart, and is al-
ways pure white.

not Russia, that

which one is right

that this is an ex-

THE WORLD’S MOST RENOWNED
CREME DE MENTHE
(Green and White)

We have just returned from a tour of France, visiting
bars, restaurants and cafes everywhere. We spoke about
wines and spirits with many of the proprietors. We par-
ticularly asked why GET was the Creme de Menthe that
dominated every bar, and was recommended so highly.
The answers were spontaneous and enthusiastic. They
all considered the White and Green Menthe made by
GET the best of Europe, the most concentrated in pep-
permint flavor, the least cloying on the palate, and the

Being skeptical by nature, we conducted our own com-
parative tastings and we are quite in accord with their
findings. Perhaps the reason is that the firm of GET
specializes particularly in Green and White Mint, and
such concentration of effort can achieve the greatest
heights. Whatever the reason, we found it eminently
satisfying, and we are certain you will enjoy it as a
spritely, cooling finale at the end of the dinner party.
