When the cellar-master reverently goes down
to the cellar to taste the wine ageing in barrel,
he takes along with him a‘tastevin’ to judge the
wine. The hollowed curves of the ‘tastevin’
allow him to examine the wine's color and
clarity. The shallow bowl is just large enough to
hold a small mouthful—all that is necessary to
taste the variety of essences needed to discern
the wine’s character. The sommeliers of the
finer restaurants also use this classic approach
to winetasting. The traditional tastevin is now
available for your use. Imported directly from
the same French artisans who supply the
vignerons of Burgundy and Beaujolais. Hand-
crafted, in heavy silverplate.

When you have that very special bottle of old Bordeaux that deserves the best
of care and presentation. The silverplated funnel handsomely sits atop most
decanters. Its slanted stem allows the wine to trickle along the side of the
decanter, thus aerating the wine as it is being poured. The silverplated grape-leaf
‘presentoire’ gracefully holds the identifying cork, to be placed around the neck
of the decanter. Beautifully presented in giftbox.

$89.95
