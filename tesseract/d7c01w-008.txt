ALSATIAN WINES...
Bottle Case
397 SYLVANER 1955 (Caves. Hanhart) . . . 1.29 14.50

Here is a typical Alsatian wine made from the Sylvaner grape—fresh, young,
exceptionally light and delightful. A perfect choice for “Spritzer”, terrace
dining, and picnic lunches.

454 RIESLING 1955 .(Waves Hannert)s..48 «ca 1.49 16.95

Riesling is one of the two greatest of all white wine grapes and particularly
thrives among the steep hills of Alsace, where it produces a dry wine of
unusual charm. Here is an excellent example at a price that will permit
serving freely this summer.

   

476 GEWURZTRAMINER 1955 (Caves Hanhart) 1.79 19.95

The most highly regarded grape of the district is the Gewurztraminer which
yields a wine not quite as dry as the Riesling, but with a bouquet that is
more prominent and more highly perfumed. This wine would be an excep-
tional value at $2.25.

diendacks 400°FLEUR DALSACE 1955. Wesel... ce 1.79 19.35

Here is the kind of gay, fresh wine that is sold ‘en carafe’ in the local res-
taurants and inns of Alsace. A superior blend of various grape varieties
grown along the foothills of the Vogue Mountains.

ast ENDAVE 444 GEWURZTRAMINER GRAND CRU 1955

 

(F. Hugel) SR ae EL NL ee Ps i 2HO.. 31.42
ae atts We herald this remarkable Alsatian wine as the best single example of white
as a eS wine we have ever tasted from the district. An extraordinary 1955 that can

rank with the great vineyards of the Rheingau. Enthusiastically recom-

mended for those who want superb Alsatian wine—you will be amazed
ng lon by its stature and breed.

MAY WINE...
Ae Hamptons 606 GERMAN MAY WINE (Gebrueder Lob) . . - 1.79 1.29 14.50

One of the most provocative aromas in the garden during the spring is one
which few people associate with drinking. They inhale the fresh, tingling
aroma of the woodruff plant, but never quite associate it with the bouquet

 

- of “May Wine”. This one has just reached us from the Rhine—we opened
a bottle and were intrigued by the garden-fresh tang which greeted us, the

; , smell of woodruff. We happily inform you that is costs but $1.29—a delight-
: [ ful and inexpensive wine to serve chilled as an aperitif during the coming
warm days.
AMERICAN WINES...
753 ST. MICHEL BLANC (California) .

This gay, dry white wine makes no more pretentions to greatness than a
cheerful little vin du pays of France. Like these, it 1s fresh, clean and satis-
fying and there are half bottles at only 54¢ each, 13.00 the case of 24.

741 HIGH TOR WHITE (Grown near New York City) .
Only 28 miles from Columbus Circle, overlooking Haverstraw on the Hud-
son, can be found a steep, carefully tended vineyard about which New York
can be proud. Its wine can be served as our very Own ‘vin du pays.’ Beauti-
fully balanced, dry, and with a most refreshing bouquet. Also available in
red or rosé at the same price.

743 FOURNIER NATURE (New York State) . . . . - - LOD ZIL.OG

Remember “Champagne Nature” with its young, crisp small “beads” of ferment—
and a sturdy wire to hold the cork in! Believe it or not such a wine 1s proudly made
by Charles Fournier at the Gold Seal vineyards in the Finger Lakes district of New
York State. Bottled in the Spring, when Nature awakens, the wine stirs and becomes
the “nature,” fresh and as beloved as its European counterpart. We were amazed when

we tasted it!
