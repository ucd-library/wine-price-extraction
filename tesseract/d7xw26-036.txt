The vineyards of Germany border one side of the Moselle—the
vineyards of Luxembourg the other. The wines are similar
although Luxembourg does not produce the equivalent of a
Berncasteler Doktor or Wehlener Sonnenuhr. These wines offer
the advantage of low price, freshness, dry delicacy, and in-
terest.

No. Bottle Case

G38. RIVANER T0080 sie aig i a, 2.68 29.05
Very light and dry. Pleasing and fresh.

O55. AURURAOls S78 Area eke 2.85 31.00
More character and depth—dry and austere.

978. -« RIESIANG (1000. 3.08 33.35

The best single dry white wine of Luxembourg.

THE WINES OF ENGLAND

Only one of these is a true wine as we know it-it is the excel-
lent Hambledon white. The other, whether they be Mead,
Ginger, or Elderberry, are interesting and are in the British
tradition of international orientation.

Sits. EBDBERBERERY WINE .....-. 2 $85: 1.59 17.50
Remember Arsenic and Old Lace?
1324: STONE'S GINGER WINE: =... 225 *. 1.99 22.00

Made in England since 1740 from English currants spiced
with Jamaica green ginger. What a pick-me-up!

1323. ARCH Menor shia... 3.49 37.95
King Alfred is reputed to be the founder of Oxford Uni-
versity and his drink was Mead. Made of raisins and
honey—a first cousin to sweet Sauternes.

845 HAMBLEDON WHITE 1969.............. 3.99 43.10
We quote the Paris Herald-Tribune, “It would take a re-
tired British Major General to dream of planting vines
and making wine in England. Maj. Gen. Sir Guy Salis-
bury-Jones was the British Military Attaché in Paris
from 1946-49.” He has succeeded well because this noble
product of British soil, rich in elegance and finesse, has
the grace of a good Moselle.

THE WINES OF JAPAN

Like England, we are dealing with an island isolated in the
ocean—a condition that does not lend itself to producing great
wines. However, some interesting, amusing, wine-like crea-
tions are made here with great skill, bringing pleasure to the
palate.

1348 HONEY WINE, FU-KI (18 OB ses fe 1.79 19.95
Japan is good at making ‘Sony’ and ‘Honey.’
1335 PLUM WINE, FU-KI [16 o@.).....5.....;. 1.79 19.95

In France, they use grapes; in Japan, plums and rice.
Sweet, delicious, interesting.

1384 SAKE RIGE WINE, FU+K. <2 3. 2.25 24.30
The traditional accompaniment to dining in Japan. Serve
ice-cold or warm—depends on your mood~especially if
you are sitting on the floor.

THE WINES OF ISRAEL

Wine has been made here since the beginning of recorded his-
tory. Reference appears throughout the Bible. Their wines
keep becoming better. In our opinion, here are the three best
of the land.

$09 CABERNET SAUVIGNON .............. 2.39 25.90
Israel accepted a great challenge when they attempted to
produce the noblest grape of Bordeaux in their land. The
excellence will please you. After all, the Rothschild fam-
ily which remains prominent in Bordeaux, founded the
vineyards in 1886.

1020 SAUVIGNON BLANC ............-.-+>> 2.39 25.90
Still clinging to Bordeaux, Israel takes on the grape that
produces Graves. They have succeeded very well.

1024 CADMAN (Rarest Grape Wine).........- 3.10 33.75

In our opinion, because of climate and skill, the most

successful wine produced in Israel. We can only com-

pare it to a rich Port, a Cream Sherry, or a Malmsey

Madeira. It is in the same exalted league.

 

THE WINES OF CHILE

The most important wine-producing country of Latin America.
Astonishing as it may seem, Chile produces and consumes
more table wine than the United States. We consider the two

listed below the best of the country—from the superb cellars
of Concha y Toro.

No. Bottle Case

622 CABERNET SAUVIGNON 1967.......... 1.98 22.00
Will take on a $4.00 Medoc, and survive in the process.

B25. PENG) BLANG tome | 6s Pe Ao 1.98 22.00
ee like a Meursault or Pouilly-Fuissé. Dry, clean,
resh.

THE WINES OF AUSTRALIA

First grapes were planted near Sidney in 1788. Note that they
still adhere to European names rather than grape varieties.
Some are surprisingly good, particulaly these two.

867 CHALAMBAR BURGUNDY 1969......... 2.69 29.06
Rich, full, from the cellars of Seppelt.
871. ARANAITA RIESLING 1987......<.. 023. 2.69 29.06

Fresh, dry, from the cellars of Seppelt.

THE WINES OF ARGENTINA

Largest wine-producing and wine-consuming country of the
western hemisphere, they do not export but drink it themselves
—over 80 bottles per capita (U.S. now 10). The red is the best—
and comes from Mendoza.

680 SAN FELIPE PEQUENA VASIJJO......... 2.49 27.40
Red wine that is particularly pleasing—rather like a
Medoc.

680 SAN FELIPE TRAMINER:As: <..5. wes 03 2.49 27.40

Dry, fruity, interesting.

 

In 1962, using
this process,
BEN SHAHN
executed this
highly regarded
silk-screen
print mask.

When color is
forced through
the open area,
the result is a
silk-screen print,
or serigraph.
