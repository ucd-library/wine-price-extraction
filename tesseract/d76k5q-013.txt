A good Pomerol is hard to come by. Here is an example about
which we are enthusiastic.

233 CHATEAU MARQUIS DE TERME....__. 7.99 86.30
Attention should be paid here! We are dealing with a great
growth of Margaux, classified in 1855. Fine texture, very ele-
gant, will live long—averages only 7,500 cases a year. Worth
much more comparatively.

pA POTEAU WENGE ge: 7.99 86.30
The most successful of all red wines in the French restaurants
of New York.

7 eee TROTANDY. i 11.50 124.85

The chief competitor in St. Julien of the Beychevelle listed
above.

This vineyard is starting to move into the exalted class of the
‘first growths.’

aor, (AU MIRRGADY 9) 22.50 243.00
The Chateau is classic and elegant and so is its wine.

312 CHATEAU CHEVAL BLANG. 3... 3 26.50 286.20
If St. Emilion were to have a ‘King,’ it would be Cheval Blanc.
187. CHATEAU ott BION 26.50 286.20

Costs 1,320 francs in Bordeaux today or $290.40. Will go higher.
A truly great wine.

1966 CHATEAU BOTTLED

A great, great claret year—a worthy successor to the classic
‘61s and an excellent precursor to the ’70s. In the grand tradi-
tion—beautifully balanced—long-lived. Rapidly disappearing off
the market.

oe SMATEAU DANSAULT ce 4.49 48.50
We still have a few cases of this wonderful chateau-bottled
srand Cru St. Emilion remaining in our cellars.

oe ete TRIRE-DAUGAY ©. 5.49 53.90
We visited this noble St. Emilion vineyard during the latter part
of May and were impressed by what we found there. Excep-
tional price for a full-flavored, beautifully balanced wine of
this caliber.

a. “tes UL ANGEIIS = 8.99 97.10
The importer received 30 Cases—none remains in Bordeaux.
oo ee reAU GIGGOURS....,........_ 9.95 107.45

tage—same proprietor, Baron Philippe de Rothschild.

We share Gregory Thomas’ enthusiasm for this noble St. Julien
vineyard.

588 CHATEAU GRUAUD LAROSE .......... 14.64 175.68
Makes bid to being the best vineyard in St. Julien.
521 Mee PALMER 2 ie 19.25 207.00

Perhaps the most difficult of all chateaux to obtain because of
excellence and scarcity. A true glory. Also available in mag-
nums at $3.00 the case additional.

aan SATERAU HAUT BRION .. 22... 29.50 318.60
Only a strong inventory permits us to maintain this $318.60
price. Now over $343.20 in Bordeaux. A truly great wine with
decades of development ahead.

215 CHATEAU LAFITE ROTHSCHILD ....__. 39.50 426.60
The current wholesale Bordeaux price is 2,040 francs the case.
Translated into current dollars at 23.5c the franc, this is $448.80.
Since the 1961 Lafite is now well over $1,000 the case we
strongly suspect this 1966 will reach equally astronomical fig-
ures in about five years. Now is the time to acquire it.

FRENCH COUNTRY WIN ES-Red

Despite the fact that the French franc was 23%2C as we went to
press, American tourists will still, this summer, occupy the
better hotels of Paris and the wonderful inns, relais, and sea-
side resorts of the French countryside. What will they drink?
In most instances, they will drink the local wines that are
charming and excellent that are stil] obtainable at low cost.
These ‘country wines’ make no pretense to greatness—each has
its own personal message, its own charm, and combines beau-
tifully with the local food specialties. They can still be enjoyed
in America today at delightfully low cost—most at well under
$3.00 the bottle. These wines are interesting—relevant to sum-
mer living—and should be enjoyed as adventures in wine tasting.
