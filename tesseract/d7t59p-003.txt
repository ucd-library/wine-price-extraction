1970 WHITE BURGUNDIES (Cont'd)

Price
May 22nd
CHABLIS VALMUR (Domaine Vocoret) Bile
Perhaps the best example of Chablis we have tasted in many
years. One of the seven great Grand Cru vineyards.
MEURSAULT CHARMES (Domaine Matrot) Sasa

From one of the best vineyards of Meursault; surpassed in distinction
by only a few great rarities among the dry white wines of France.
Full-bodied, well balanced, dry, racy.

CHASSAGNE=MONTRACHET BLANC (Bachelet-Ramonet) Bi s70
Outstanding example of estate-bottled classic white Burgundy.
It is the proud property of the Bachelet-Ramonet family - endowed
with much finesse and distinction.

PULIGNY MONTRACHET, REFERTS (Domaine Sauzet) B).73
We spent a day with M. Sauzet and we undertand why he was
elected President of the White Wine Growers of Burgundy. He
represents authority, knowledge and dedication. The wine that
he produces reflect these attributes.

PULIGNY MONTRACHET, COMBETTES (Domaine Sauzet) 64.25
A 'First Growth’. The vineyard, only 16 acres in size, often
achieves the kind of excellence associated with its more illustrious
neighbor 'Montrachet'. A glory.

NUITS ST. GEORGES BLANC (Domaine Gouges) 64.70
A rarity - only 100 cases of white Nuits produced. Here is the
very wine featured at Chez Garin in Paris. Extraordinary.

CHASSAGNE-MONTRACHET, RUCHOTTES (Ramone?) 70.10
'Ruchottes' (means beehive) is our personal favorite. In blind
tastings that we have held, it has been able to stand up against
'Montrachet' itself - and at less than half the price.

BIENVENUE BATARD MONTRACHET (Domaine Sauzet) 96 .65
The Batard Montrachet vineyard is small enough - the tiny
northerly portion bears the added description ‘Bienvenue’.

Golden, rare, full-bodied and dry.

BATARD MONTRACHET (Domaine Niellon) 102.50
One of the most celebrated white wine vineyards of the world.
Hard to come by, rich in flavor, distinguished bouquet,
exceptional longevity.

CHEVALIER MONTRACHET (Domaine Niellon) 107.45
Less than 1000 cases produced annually. A great-rarity and
memorable. Only 17 irreplaceable cases remain.

MONTRACHET (Domaine Bouchard) 215.45
The most sought-after white wine of the world. Tremendous
bouquet, rich in flavor, great class; dry, but with underlying
luscious softness. ode 60 precious cases reached the U.S.
