AN INTRIGUING RARITY - MONTILLA FROM SPAIN

Montilla deserves to be better known, It is grown in the chalky
hills south of Cordoba and rivals Sherry in excellence, Its chief
difference from Sherry is the fact that it is rarely fortified, thus
yielding an alcohol strength below 18%. Like Sherry, it has its
Finos, Olorosos and rare old wines. Those listed below come from
Alvear, the oldest and most reliable of all the firms in Montilla,

ALVEAR MONTILLA FINO 2.49
Bone-dry, pale. Serve chilled as an aperitif. This is the

kind of wine that has become popular before dinner instead

of the Martini.

ALVEAR AMO NTILLADO
Richer in body and flavor than the Fino described above,
but a bit less dry.

ALVEAR MONTILLA SOLERA 1750 14,95 162.00
Not every drop is of the year 1750. We are dealing with a

Solera - a barrel laid down in 1750. Each year since then

a portion was taken out of the barrel and replenished with

current wine, Only a mathematician can figure out the

average age but we do know it is very rich, very full,

medium dry and utterly remarkable.
