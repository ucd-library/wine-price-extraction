Here is the gayest, most original, most
useful, and most attractive Christmas
gift container for wines and spirits we
have yet run across. Your selections of
wines and spirits will become a unique,
exciting gift when sent in this sturdy

metal “Napoleonic Drum.”

Anyone would be delighted with its
colorful festive charm and hand-painted

decoration. A conversation piece under

to many after uses—an attractive waste
paper basket, a storage container for
wines and spirits, telephone books; a
toy chest or laundry hamper—it is water
tight and also makes a wonderful ice
bucket for chilling Champagne and
white wine. Add only 3.50 in addition
to cost of your selection for Napoleonic

Drum.
