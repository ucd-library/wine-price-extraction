  

to Add Joy for

Summer is the time to play — to be carefree — and to enjoy out-
door dining, whether it be a beach party, a picnic, on a terrace,
or on a mountain top.

Psychologists agree with wine experts that no wine blends more
harmoniously on these happy occasions than the good Champagnes
of France, are festive sparkling wines from other vineyard areas.

We would like to add a happy economic note by simply stating it
is not necessary to be extravagant to serve Champagne. Here, we
have selected some superb examples from France and from our
native vineyards, that are not only intrinsically good, but have
been chosen because they will not make a serious dent in the
family summer holiday budget. Don’t overlook the fine French
vintage Champagne at $5.49 the bottle, nor the excellent New York
State Champagne at $2.99 the bottle.

36 MARCEL PERE BRUT 1964. . . 5.49 59.30
An astonishing Champagne opportunity. Made of selected grapes
gathered during the great 1964 harvest. The wine is completely dry,
surprisingly good and sensationally priced. Half bottles are available
at $2.95 each; $64.00 the case of 24 — and Magnums at $11.80 each;
$64.00 the case — and there are Splits at only $1.53 each!

33 MESNIL BRUT, BLANC DE

BLANGS. 9. Ok 6 ee
Every drop is made exclusively out of white wine pressed from white
grapes, in the choicest wine growing town of Champagne — MESNIL.
The grower is Veuve Galien, proudly featured by Nicolas of Paris,
and can seriously be considered as the best value among the great
Champagnes of France.

17 ST. MARCEAUX BRUT. : 5.99 68.50
In a recent issue of the London Financial Times, immediately after a
comparative Champagne tasting, their wine editor, Edmund Penning-
Rowsell, reported “St. Marceaux was light and elegant.” High praise
indeed! Since St. Marceaux was in competition with Krug, Clicquot,
Charles Heidsieck, Taittinger and Roederer. Note low price for this
world-famous Champagne.

We again quote from the London Financial Times, “Some prefer a
Champagne with a good deal of ‘winey’ flavour, others go for fresh-
ness and delicacy; hence the vogue for Blanc de Blancs.” Here is a
young, beautifully balanced example from the outstanding 1964
vintage.

155 AYALA GOLD LABEL

BRUT 19064. 3 5 a 6 oe
Ayala is featured on wine lists everywhere in Paris and London, but is
not quite as well known in New York. It deserves to be. Half bottles
are available at $3.49 each; $78.00 the case — and Magnums at $13.80
each; $78.00 the case.

44 ST. MARCEAUX BRUT

OBA ee a 76.50
Note how high the St. Marceaux Non-Vintage scored in the British
wine tasting (see above). The 1964 has a shade more depth and finesse,
since it is the single product of a great vintage year, and not a blend of
several years.

89. ST. MARCEAUX BLANC DE

HEANES 1964. sg lak, se ae
Some ‘Blanc de Blancs’ command over $10 the bottle and worth it. In
our opinion, this 1964 is a worthy aristocrat that should be in that
price class, but, thanks to astute selection, we are able to offer the
wine fancier a $5.00 saving in Champagne value. Skeptical? — Try it.

34 LOUIS ROEDERER BRUT

1962) esa 900 ANB TS
We are now in the big leagues. Here is a classic vintage Champagne,
from a world renowned firm —a firm that genuinely believes that

there is no better Champagne made in France than this one, regardless
of price.

Here, we think we are contending with the Chateau Haut Brion or

can no longer be obtained even in France today) 1s just becoming

ready to drink in “Cuvee Royal.” It is made exclusively of the very
best of 100% rated grapes.

116 BOLLINGER, R. D. 1959

(Recently Disgorged). . . . . 14.50 156.50
What is ‘R. D.’? It means ‘Recently Disgorged’. Normally, the 1959
vintage is disgorged in 1964 and the export cork then inserted. Fresh-
ness would have been lost during the subsequent six year period.
Bollinger overcomes time’s toll by disgorging and recorking the 1959
vintage in 1970. This extends the freshness, elegance and balance for
an additional six years.

82 MOET & CHANDON
DOM PERIGNON 1962. . .- 15.55 16794

Here is the most sought-after, the most expensive, and the most highly
rationed Champagne of France. Proudly cloaked in its attractive,
classic Dom Perignon, bottle, it proclaims “I am the King of Cham-
pagnes.” The time to buy Dom Perignon 1962 is during this summer,
when it is freely available, and before the inevitable rationing of the
Autumn season sets in. We are also inclined to believe that the 1962
vintage approaches its world depletion, to be followed, soon, by 1964.

2 ANDRE MONCIER BRUT
(Finger Lakes, N.Y.) . 5's.) 299 |. See

The American Champagnes produced in the Finger Lakes district of
New York generally command over $4.00 the bottle. We will match
this one, beautifully made and delightfully dry, with any of them, and
at only $2.99. With cost as low as this, you can serve Champagne with
the same carefree abandon generally reserved for Bourbon or Scotch.

72 SPARKLING VOUVRAY,

Oudinot 3.99 43.10
‘Ouvrez le Vouvray’ is the cry that fills the Parisian air during the
summer — especially when, like Champagne, it is ‘sparkling’. Fruity,
rich in flavor, here is captured the garden-like quality of the Loire
Valley, where it is grown. A happy selection for those who like ‘Cham-
pagne’, but would be more pleased if it were not quite so dry.

81 BOYER BRUT 1966

(Haut Savoie). « «se 3.99 43.10
If you do not insist that your French sparkling wine needs the appella-
tion ‘Champagne’, here is the wine you should drink. The makers
learned their trade in the Champagne district, carried their craft to the
French Alps, grew the excellent local grape varieties and proceeded to
make a dry French sparkling wine that your friends and you will really
enjoy. Great delicacy and finesse.

836 CLAIRETTE DE DIE

(romeys ss Fo I a ee ee
Grown in the Departement of the Dréme, near the town of ‘Die’. Here
is a French sparkling wine that has delighted autoists travelling the
southern part of France. This marks the first time that this unique
wine has been brought to America. Dry — but not quite as dry as
most Champagnes.

53 SCHRAMSBERG BLANC DE
BLANCS 1967... . 6.99 79.50

Robert Louis Stevenson visited Schramsberg in 1880 and devoted a
chapter of his ‘Silverado Squatters’ to its wines. It is the kind of truly
outstanding Champagne that has never been East before, and is still
rationed among the Champagne aficionados of California. Very dry,
fine character, expensive, but worth it.
