An important wine event is taking place at Sherry’s—the
remarkable 1961 red Burgundies, destined to be the most
long lived of our generation, have now reached our cellars,
bringing their extraordinary depth of flavor, roundness and
noble character to you—and each is priced at its low acqui-
sition cost, and not its current higher replacement value.

If you want to drink great red B dy NOW, aglow
with fruit and charm, drink the fabulous 1959s which you
see on the following pages—they will be most ready, and
dominate the scene for the immediate. If your taste runs to
Burgundies that have more depth, and therefore will need
more bottle age, acquire the 1961s now, while they are
available, keep them in your cellar for a while, and the
reward will be great in the future—that day when you pull
the cork and you experience a wine that is sure to be one of
Burgundy’s noblest.

For those interested in the future of their wine holdings,
we also wish to report during the Spring of 1964, we will be
able to offer you the following great 1961s—Bonne Mares
and Musigny of Comte de Voguc; the La Tache, Riche-
bour and Grands Echezeaux of the Domaine de la
Romanee Conti; the Volnays of Marquis d’Angerville; the
Marion Chambertin of Gelin; the Corton of Prince de
Merode; and the noble Nuits St. Georges of Henri Gouges.

20) EC PPEAUN . Lk 5 ee 6 ee 438.50
Estate bottled, A. Noblet

We first met Mr. Noblet, the Cellar Master at the Domaine de la Romanee
Conti back in 1950. We respect his wine making skill and it is reflected in his
“‘Echezeaux” which he makes at his own property.

*240 POMMARD LES EPENOTS . . 4.39 48.50
Estate bottled, A. Laubet
For Pommard at its best, look for the “Epenots’’ or “‘Rugiens” Vineyards,

*652 VOSNE ROMANEE,
CLOS DES REAS. ..... 449 49.50
Estate bottled, L. Gros

There is greatness here. From some of the best soil of Vosne-Romanee, ex-
pressed through the honest, uncompromising vinification of Louis Gros.

*264 CHAPELLE CHAMBERTIN. . 4.49 49.50
Estate bottled, Clair-Dau

The 13 acres of Chapelle ranks just below Chambertin itself and not much
more than half the price.

*635 BONNES MARES e e a e e 4.79 52.75
Estate bottled, Groffier

A_ beautiful combination of delicacy, operating against the background of
robustness.

"647 GRANDS ECHEZEAUX .. . 4.79 52.75
Estate bottled, Mongeard

Though the name of this wine sounds like a sneeze, there is true glory in it.
Some of the best Burgundy we have ever tasted has come from this vineyard.

*643 CLOS DE VOUGEOT ... . 6.49 71.00
Estate bottled, L. Gros

Here is a vigneron who grows on you. (Forgive the pun.) From some of the
best soil of this large 45 acre vineyard.

*638 MUSIGNY e e e e e . e es 6.99 77.00
Estate bottled, Jean Hudelot

There are only 25 acres in Musigny. The largest is Comte de Vogue. Though
Hudelot owns only about 4 acres, its superlative merits are recognized by the
experts in Burgundy.

275 CHAMBERTIN MARION. . . 7.49 82.00
Estate bottled, P. Gelin

Dr. Marion, one of the great surgeons in France, has always been proud of
his Chambertin holdings. Local growers concede that it is his Chambertin that
has the greatest finesse.

*660 RICHEBOURG ..... . 8.98 98.00
Estate bottled, L. Gros

Le Richebourg is the fullest of the great red wines of Vosne-Romanee. The
balance is magnificent, not one characteristic stands out, but all combine to
form a perfect harmony. Scarce and hard to come by.

*664 VOSNE ROMANEE,

LAGRANDRUE. .... . 8.95 98.00
Estate bottled, H. Lamarche

I have known Burgundians who have stated, “La Grand Rue’ is the best

vineyard soil of the entire Cote d’Or. This may be open to question. But the

least that can be said of this wine is that it is a giant, entirely remarkable, and

la to be in the company of the great. Only 140 cases were produced in

*Half bottles available at $3 extra the case.
