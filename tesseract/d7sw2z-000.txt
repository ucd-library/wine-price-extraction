WE INVITE OUR CLIENTELE TO SHARE

some of our discoveries ~ wines and spirits that
have given us the joy of outstanding experiences
in tasting—those ultimately chosen here are worthy
representatives of their class—honest values—and,
in many instances—sensational bargains. We can
think of no pleasanter way to greet the advent of
Spring than to alert you, in these pages, to some
of our ‘favorites’ — those bottles in our century-
old cellars that we consider particularly notable

value.
