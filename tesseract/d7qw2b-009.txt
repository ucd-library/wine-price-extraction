Here is the gayest, most original Christmas gift container for wines
and spirits shown in New York since Repeal. Your selections of
wines and spirits will become a unique gift when sent in this sturdy
wooden “Cellarette’. Anyone would be delighted with its festive
charm, hand-painted scenes and colorful Parisian labels. A conver-
sation piece under any Christmas tree, it is readily adapted to many
after uses — storage for wines and spirits, a wood box for the fire-
place, a toy chest. Nor should one overlook the many clever
decorative uses to which it can readily be put by the ingenious
housewife. You may choose any 8 to 12 bottles in this catalog and
simply add 3.50 for Cellarette.
