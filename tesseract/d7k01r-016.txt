WHITE AMERICAN WINES

DEL MAR RANCH 1974,
en Monterey Vineyard
Included because it is the most
typical of American wines - not
only the name, but the character.
Dry. Ideal for everyday.

BULLY HILL WHITE 1973, Walter Taylor
Among the best dry white wines produced in the
Finger Lakes area.

PINOT CHARDONNAY 1972, Wente

A classic ever since the days that the inspectors
of Guide Michelin proclaimed it one of the best
dry white wines of America and the equivalent of
a good Meursault.

JOHANNISBERG RIESLING 1974, Monterey Vineyard
Young, fragrant, fruity, with much finesse and
character.

CEWURZTRAMINER 1973, Simi
Long famed for their reds, Simi now produces some
remarkable whites.

JOHANNISBERG RIESLING SPATLESE 1969,

Dr. KK. Fran:

In the tradition of Edison or Fulton, Dr. Frank was
the first to succeed in producing fine wine, not from
Fastern grapes but from European varietals. No
easy feat considering the cold climate of the Finger

Lakes. Excellent.

WHITE RIESLING 1974, Callaway
Grown in Temecula, about 25 miles uphill from

Newport Beach.

FUME BLANC 1974, Robert Mondavi
Robert Mondavi, a great wine-maker, reaches a

pinnacle of excellence here.

PINOT CHARDONNAY 1973, Freemark Abbey

This ig the very wine that won first award in a blind
tasting among wine experts in competition with out-
standing Montrachets and Corton CharlemagneS.
America can be proud of this one.
