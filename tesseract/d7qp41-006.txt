For the greatest dry white wines of the world, one
must look to Burgundy with its Montrachets, Chablis,
Corton Charlemagnes and Pouilly Fuisses. They may
lack the fruity bouquet of the German wines, but they
compensate with fantastic breed, airy lightness and
subtle finesse. Each of these wines are top flight with-
in their class, having passed the test of our tasting
panel gloriously. They will bring joy to the palate of
discriminating drinkers of white wine—and not unim-
portantly, represent the best values, dollar for dollar,
of any collection of white Burgundies available any-
where in the United States.

1968 VINTAGE
PO RE ois een ek 1.69 18.25

From the Cellars of Nicolas

Nicolas of Paris, with their 1700 wine shops, is the largest wine
buyer in the world. When their buyer goes into Chablis, economics
and tradition give them the pick of the crop. This will be clearly
demonstrated when you taste this light, fresh, young Chablis with
its haunting bouquet and its fresh tingling effect on your palate.
Even the most uninitiated can recognize that this price is not just
good, but sensationally low.

1967 VINTAGE
617 CHABLIS LA FORET.......5.:°%.. 2.19 23.65

From the Cellars of Vocoret

This is not ordinary Chablis, but the proud growth of a “Premier
Cru” vineyard. It commands $4.00 in most stores, and $10.00 in
most restaurants. Quantity dwindling so we suggest you order
soon.

G05 POORLY FUISSE 2 Ss 2.49 26.90
From the Cellars of Nicolas

A wine of great charm, this Pouilly Fuisse provides a lovely solu-
tion to the hostess problem; an inexpensive white wine to serve
without fuss to people who enjoy good, dry wine.

365 BATARD MONTRACHET.......... 6.99 79.50
Estate Bottled, Bachelet Ramonet

Dry, yet rounded; great elegance and breed and a haunting capti-
vating bouquet.

474 CORTON CHARLEMAGNE ........ 6.99 75.50
Estate Bottled, Bonneau du Martray

When Corton Charlemagne is good, it is classed with the illustrious
Montrachet. Great breed, and steelier than most white Burgundies.
The slopes are the steepest in Burgundy and must be tended by
hand since horses and oxen cannot climb here. Remarkable, scarce
and excellent.

1966 VINTAGE

B20 MEURSAULT 1966 ...:; .. 6s eee cs 3.69 39.85
Estate Bottled, Potinet-Ampeau

Meursault, in French, means “Leap of the Mouse” — what an in-
triguing name! Even more intriguing is this distinguished, bone-dry
white wine, green-gold in color, racy, somewhat full-bodied, well-
balanced and of true distinction.

319 CHASSAGNE MONTRACHET
I a a 3.49 37.70

Estate Bottled, Bachelet Ramonet

Even a village wine in the hands of the Ramonet family becomes a
thing of beauty. We have visited the Ramonets often and we can
only say that no one in Burgundy matches their white’ wine skill.

418 CHABLIS, PREMIER CRU,
a A oe oe ies 3.69 39.85
Estate Bottled, Marcel Servin

We first visited Marcel Servin in 1950. He enjoys the reputation in
the village of Chablis as the best wine maker of them all. He has
maintained that reputation since. Here is a wine of heritage.

This vineyard has been a consistent favorite of ours since we first
tasted it in Ramonet’s cellars back in 1948. His skill is impeccable.

1964 VINTAGE

380 CHASSAGNE MONTRACHET

DIORGHOL 2.77 bi 3.99 43.10
Estate Bottled, Ramonet
Over five years have passed since the grapes for this excellent
1964 have been harvested. Our recent tasting indicates clearly that
time is proving a friend because this wine is truly now coming into
its own and will provide a dramatic white wine companion to the
fish dish, lobster, chicken, roast pork or ham.

510 PULIGNY MONTRACHET, REFERTS 4.79 51.75
Estate Bottled, Sauzet

This town produces what are generally considered the finest dry
white wines of France. Of course, the most fanfed is the Montra-
chet vineyard itself. Not as exalted, but entirely admirable, is the
noble white wine produced at the Referts vineyard, particularly
when it passes through the knowledgeable hands of M. Sauzet.

1962 VINTAGE

633 PULIGNY MONTRACHET,

PREMIER GURU ©. oe 2.79 30.15
Estate Bottled, Sauzet
If this wine commanded $5.00 the bottle, it would be well worth it.
A 1962 from this noble heritage and just coming into its own. If you
want great, great white Burgundy at below $3.00 the bottle — we
suggest you eagerly and enthusiastically jump at this opportunity.

660 PULIGNY MONTRACHET,

CHAMP CANE .. 2.3.5 33 2.99 32.30
Estate Bottled, Sauzet
From a specific, noble vineyard, produced during the outstandingly
fine 1962 vintage by the impeccable grower, M. Sauzet. If you can
find this in any restaurant at $10 the bottle, by all means buy it —
if our inventory hold out, and you want great white Burgundy at
low cost, by all means acquire it.

1961 VINTAGE

686 PULIGNY MONTRACHET, REFERTS 3.49 = 37.70

Estate Bottled, Sauzet

1961 was great in Bordeaux, in red Burgundy and among the white
Burgundies. Like 1952, the '61 whites are destined to live a long,
long time. This ’61 is just beginning to show its class with probably
a decade of joyous life still ahead. A rarity, because no estate
bottled white Burgundy ofthis calibre can be found in any cellars
along the Cote d’Or.
