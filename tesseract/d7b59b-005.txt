THE MOST FABULOUS AND EXPENSIVE TABLE WINES OF THE WORLD
CeCe ae se eee ee ee ta alee peers renee

The very experience of tasting any of these truly great, extraordinary Trockenbeerenauslesen represents one
of the highest possible points in wine drama - it is sheer essence, a concentrated nectar, whose flower-like
bouquet will fill the room in glorious fashion. The grapes are picked late in the season, when they have
shrivelled to a raisin and only amazing richness remains. Even in Germany, good examples of
Trockenbeerenaulesen command up to $60.00 the bottle.

During the latter part of August, we will be receiving about two to three cases of each of these wine glories.
Our advice is to order now while the selection is complete. The bottles will stand you in good stead during
the months ahead for your important holiday dinners and meaningful Christmas gifts.

DEDUCT 10% FROM THESE PRICES PROVIDED YOU PURCHASE 12 OR MORE ASSORTED BOTTLES.

RED WINES FROM NORTHERN CALIFORNIA FOR LAYING DOWN

*Those with an asterisk available for immediate delivery
The delivery date of the remainder is indicated in the description

Why are American wines included here? The answer is that they have been sadly neglected up to now and
there is no red wine produced anywhere in the world where the reward is greater by adding sufficient bottle
age to the wine. This is particularly true of the 'Cabernet Sauvignon’ grape (the grape that produces the

great clarets in Bordeaux) because the Cabernet grape takes longer to reach maturity when grown in California
soil than in the Bordeaux area. The growth in quality and in price is typical of many of the better vineyards
of California and we list them below, limiting ourselves to the best red wine they are capable of producing -
the Cabernet Sauvignon. We urge that you try the experiment of buying them now, laying them away and
serving proudly glorious fine wine from our native soil.

Highly rationed. Only a few cases will reach us in November. Order them now to make

certain you get your share. Will soon command over $40.00. Especially fine.

CABERNET SAUVIGNON, Robert Mondavi......sscceceees Vre Sere ee ee

We salute! We have just returned from Napa, California and we were amazed by what

we tasted here. In our opinion, the best red wine ever produced in America and in the

league with the well-known clarets of Bordeaux. However, it still requires more barrel

age and the wine will not reach us until April 1969. Since the total production is so
tiny, we strongly suggest you acquire it now and lay it away for a year or two.
