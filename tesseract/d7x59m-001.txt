EAE
SHERRY WINE & SPIRITS CO., INC.

AND

M. LEHMANN, INC.

Two Long Established and Dedicated Institutions That En Joy a
Reputation as The Leading Wine and Spirits Merchants of America

THE PURPOSE: It is an acknowledged principle of
our American society that a well-planned merger is
designed to bring advantages to everyone—most of all
the eventual consumer. Under responsible manage-
ment, it carries in its wake a wider range of available
products, better service, a more educated and dedi-
cated staff, and the inevitable savings that will be trans.
lated into dollars and cents reductions to you.

THE PERSONNEL:
well-informed, highly experienced, and eager-to-help
associates of both Sherry Wine & Spirits Co., Inc. and
M. Lehmann, Inc. will be available as previously to
offer personal, courteous, and considerate service.

We happily report that the

FROM SHERRY’S, the personnel will include the
familiar sales staff that have been there during the

last decades — Jack Aaron — Sam Aaron — Kenneth
Dean — Michael Aaron and their associates. And, of
course, James Beard, internationally tamous wine and
food authority, will remain as a consultant.

FROM LEHMANN’ there will be Joseph Stricks and
associates — all devoted counselors to the Lehmann
clientele for many years.

THE PLACE: The home of SHERRY-LEHMANN,
INC. is now at 679 Madison Avenue—just north of 61st
Street, The telephone number is TE 8-7500 (kindly
note it down). Those who are accustomed to Lehmann’s
familiar, friendly corner at 66th Street need merely
walk four blocks south along Madison Avenue to find
their favorite salesmen ready to serve them now — but
with many more items and facilities at their command.
