454 Anjou Rose 1966, Nicolas. . . . . 1.49 16.10

An excellent example of the soft, fruity flavor and delightful color associated with the
good pink wines of the Loire Valley.

905 Cote de Provence 1966, Nicolas . - Bee 2

This sprightly ‘“‘Vin Rosé’’, is typical of the wine you drink along the Cote d’Azur or
in the outdoor bistros of Paris. After all, it is a best-seller in Paris since it comes from the
cellars of Nicolas.

852 Sciatino Rose 1966 (Corsica). . . . 1.49 16.10

20,000 acres are in vines on this beautiful island that lies south of France and west of
Italy in the Mediterranean Sea. This was the preferred wine of the island’s famous son,
Napoleon Bonaparte. Similar to a pink wine from Provence. Most of the vignerons
here have recently emigrated from North Africa where they could no longer ply their
trade. They brought with them their knowledge and the wines are now outstandingly
better than they were a decade ago.

786 Bordeaux Blanc 1964, Domaine de la
MEM Oc ae ee

Medium dry, pleasant and glowing with fruit. Fantastic value. From a specific small
and excellent vineyard and bottled by ‘‘Talleyrand”’.

788 Graves Superieur 1964, Domaine de
Fegron — * eee oe ee ee

A pleasing, relatively dry example of good everyday wine from the Graves district.
’ . : “nT sie ”
Grown at a good vineyard and bottled in Bordeaux by “‘Talleyrand’’.

234 Caillou Blanc de Chateau Talbot 1966
(MOGOC) . 6.65 [a.. 2oe

The Medoc is noteworthy for its red wines and has a few vineyards that produce white
wines which include Chateau Margaux, Chateau Paveil and the renowned ee
Talbot. This will not compete with the great dry white wines of Graves, but you will
find balance, freedom from sweetness, breed and individual quality. The price,
obviously, is a good one.

795 Barsac, Chateau Montjoie, 1962. . 2.19 23.65

There are 5 townships in Sauternes and the most famous one is Barsac. It can be called
Sauternes but it proudly proclaims itself as “‘Barsac’”’. Generally, they are less sweet
than Sauternes but there is a special delicacy and fruit that are apparent. This is not
equal to Climens but it is good. It is not bottled at the Chateau but in Bordeaux by
“Talleyrand”. The savings is passed on to you.

821 Sauternes 1964, Chateau Grillon . . 2.19 23.65

This is not Chateau d’Yquem even though it comes from Sauternes but it is good,
It is rich, golden in flavor and color, decidedly sweet and a natural desert wine. A good
balance of fruit and bouquet. Bottled in Bordeaux by “‘Talleyrand” and the savings
are passed on to you.

614 Tavel 1966, Salavert ee ay

Tavel, the most famed Vin Rosé of France, comes from an arid, rocky little valley
between Avignon and Nimes.

270 Rose de Marsannay 1966, Andre Bart . 2.79
Here we are dealing with soil not far from Chambertin itself, with the same grape that
produces Chambertin “Pinot Noir”, and with the grower who estate-bottles the wine.
No nobler heritage for pink wine exists anywhere in the world. A new high is created
here. By all means, try it.

469 Bourgogne “Chainette” 1966, Hopital

Psychiatrique_ . SC ee
There is a vineyard next to the medieval town wall of Auxerre that is called “La
Chainette’”’. The vineyard has been owned for centuries by the county hospital which
is now devoted exclusively to caring for the emotional problems of about 1,000 resident
patients. Those patients, whose background is viniculture, cultivate the vine and tend
to the barrels and bottles. They know what they are doing. They plant in this Bur-
gundian soil only the Pinot Noir grape. The resulting pink wine is not just good but
extraordinary. Unfortunately, the total production is small. Our tiny shipment will
reach us before the end of June. If interested, please, please buy it now.

232 Chateau Ferrande 1966 (Graves) . . 2.29 24.75

Chateau Ferrande consists of 25 acres producing a little over 3,000 wines a year, all
chateau-bottled. Mr. Pierre Nicolas of Paris bought it all because he liked the wine and
rightly so. Some of it has reached us. Our tasting notes read, “‘beautiful balance, really
dry for Graves, fine bouquet, much finesse.”

363 Chateau Lafaurie-Peyraguey 1964
te ee , 2.79 30.15

Located just opposite Chateau d’Yquem. Dominated by a Moorish-walled castle built
in the 13th century. Probably the most full-bodied of all Sauternes. One of the best of
the 1964s. Very sweet, rich and fruity.

812 Chateau Climens 1962 (Barsac). . . 2,99 32.30
Characteristically, this great Barsac is at its best when relatively young and in about
6 or 7 years after the vintage. In great years, such as 1929 and 1947, it even excels
Chateau d’Yquem, although lighter. A perfect Sauternes and at what we consider a
perfect price.

367 Chateau Haut Brion Blanc 1966
(Graves) . 7.95 89.50

Only last month, we spent 3 glorious nights and days at Chateau Haut Brion. We fell
in love, not only with their great reds but with their glorious whites, particularly the
1966. Only 600 cases of this year produced. Some will reach us during late June.
A word of advice—if you want to experience the greatest white wine of Bordeaux and
one of the great white wines of the world, we recommend—no, we urge—that you
order it now before we find it necessary to say, “All gone”.

254 Chateau D’Yquem 1959 (Sauternes) . 9.95 107.45

The most famous and the most valuable vineyard in the world. Its 15th century
Chateau has been photographed ad infinitum. It is jealously supervised to achieve
perfection by the Marquis de Lur-Saluces. The most consistently expensive wine of the
world. It only produces 50 cases per acre, the lowest in the world. Of a great vintage
year like 1959, it is truly fabulous with powerful distinction, finesse, fruit and glorious
sweetness. It is to the wine world what Shakespeare and Goethe are to literature. A true
bargain despite its high price.
