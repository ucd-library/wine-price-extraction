Well known wine and spirits retaile1
Sam Aaron, president of New York’
Sherry-Lehmann, Inc. gave some

very practical advice on star
$50 wine cellar.

Commentaries included both Ameri-
can and imported wine types. Among
interesting points was an explana-
tion by Burgess Meredith on h op to
taste wine properly—smell for bou
quet, hold to light for color, put a
tiny bit of wine under the tongue
and breathe. (The taste, Mr. Sichel
commented, will continue to be with
you for a number of seconds, or will
stop suddenly—the length of time
reflects the greatness of the wine.)
Sherry-Lehmann’s Sam Aaron spoke
on the value of vintage charts as
general guides but cautioned against
taking them too literally. He pointed
out that great vineyards have pro
duced poor wines during great years
and extraordinary wines during a
poor year. He also urged budding
wine devotees to ‘adventure among
the vineyards of the world,’ to try a
great variety of wines whether they
be from California, New York,
France, Spain, Portugal, Germany,
Israel, Australia or wine-producing
countries of South America. ‘It’s not
enough to just find a wine you like
and repeat yourself ad infinitum,’ he
sald.
