 

RED BORDEAUX

Prices for the red wines of Bordeaux have regained their senses.
The unhappy upward spiral of the peak “wine-boom” years
have ceased. In fact, prices for nearly all the famed chateaux
are now at realistic levels, considerably below the expensive
heights of a few years ago.

Presented here is a wide-ranging sample of Bordeaux rouge.
We hope you will enjoy selecting from a list that includes
young, light wines ready for present pleasure, recent vintages
of the chateau-bottled aristocracy now to be laid down, and
peerless treasures from the outstanding harvests of the past
twenty-five years.

1972 VINTAGE

Opening prices broke all records. The austere Cabernet Sauvig-
non grape thrived, while the softer Merlot did not, hence the
Médoc, where Cabernet flourishes, produced better wines than
did Saint-Emilion and Pomerol.

No. Bottle Case

658 CHATEAU LAROQUE (St. Emilion)...... 2.79 33.48
Chateau-bottled St. Emilion at such a low price? Yes!
Will go quickly.

313 CHATEAU RAUSAN SEGLA (Margaux).. 3.69 44.28
Still young, but already showing the delicacy and per-
fume which mark the magnificent wines of this commune.

241 CHATEAU DUHART MILON

ROTHSCHILD (Pauillac) .............. 3.99 47.88
One of the prestigious Pauillacs of Elie de Rothschild.
A wine to cellar for a few more years.

166 CHATEAU FIGEAC (St. Emilion) ........ 4.99 59.88
Note dramatic low price for this popular St. Emilion,
second only to Cheval Blanc.

172 CHATEAU LAFITE ROTHSCHILD

SPORE) 5 oS te ic as 13.75 165.00
Lafite in any year is a wine of note. This vintage has
much life ahead and is a bargain now—and ready to drink.

1971 VINTAGE

Overlooked because of universal praise showered on the ’70s,
the ’71s may ultimately prove their equal; in many instances
they will outlive the ’70s. Body, power, and fullness are recog-
nizable features. Low yields meant concentrated flavor. Will
mature slowly and gracefully.

659 CHATEAU CADILLAG
(Bordeaux Supérieur) ..............--- 2.19 26.28
No lucky Bordelais can find so honest and satisfying a
wine for everyday as this chateau-bottled discovery.

263 CHATEAU GREYSAC (Médoc)........... 3.49 41.88
A delight. Consistently popular with our Bordeaux-loving
clientele.

379 CHATEAU LAROSE TRINTAUDON

(Haut-Médoc) .............-+.2+-220: 3.69 39.85

Generous, gratifying. A smart selection for cost-con-
scious wine buyers. Will add elegance to any holiday
dinner.

332 CHATEAU BOUSCAUT (Graves)........ 4.99 59.88
An out-and-out bargain.

278 CHATEAU PRIEURE LICHINE (Margaux). 5.99 71.88
Alexis Lichine’s inspired Prieuré was one of the best of
Margaux in this fabulous year.

341 CHATEAU DUHART MILON
ROTHSCHILD (Pauillac) .............. 5.99 71.88
We must ask you to wait until the end of this decade be-
fore broaching this great bottle. One of the best Médocs
produced in this famed vintage.

242 CHATEAU PAPE CLEMENT (Graves) .... 7.49 89.88
First class claret. Concentrated, rich and earthy.

139 CHATEAU LAFITE ROTHSCHILD
(Pauillac): 2060 ino eee oe ee 22.50 270.00
The acquisition of a case of 1971 Lafite is an important
step in the history of any wine-lover’s cellar. But it will
repay the patience of neophyte or connoisseur with the
same unequalled wine experience a decade hence.

1970 VINTAGE

Shares with ’45 and ’61 the honor of being among the very best

vintages since World War II. Considering the excellence, quan-

tity produced was surprisingly large. Fully developed Merlot

grapes added soft and round elegance. Holds promise of long

life.

No. Bottle Case

208 CHATEAU GRAND PONTET (St. Emilion) . 4.99 53.90
Barton & Guestier, highly regarded Bordeaux wine mer-
chants, bring us this lovely St. Emilion. Exceptional value
and ideal for present drinking.

ment in 1970. St. Julien’s happy harmony of fruit and
flavor apparent here.

236 CHATEAU BOUSCAUT (Graves)......... 6.49 77.88
Jean Delmas, master of the wines at Chateau Haut-Brion,
makes this glorious Graves, too. Fared extremely well in
the celebrated 1970 vintage.

330 CHATEAU TALBOT (St. Julien).......... 6.49 77.88
Among the most consistently popular red wines of Bor-
deaux. Much fruit and depth.

211 CHATEAU DUHART MILON

ROTHSCHILD (Pauillac) .............-- 6.99 83.88
A worthy brother to the other member of Baron E. de
Rothschild’s wine family: Lafite. Price well below whole-
sale.

727 CHATEAU BEAUSEJOUR (St. Emilion)... 7.49 89.88
One of the noble Premier Grand Crus Classés of St.
Emilion. Relatively rare and hard to find.

hint at the outstanding quality of this great wine.
Colossal.
