No. Bottle Case
454 ANJOU ROSE 1966, Nicolas. 1.49 16.10

Light, rather fruity, slight touch of sweetness—a sound, inexpen-
sive carafe wine.

905 COTE DE PROVENCE 1966,
WitGmde §. 2 ee 1.49 16.10

The sprightly, sunny qualities of the Provence are captured here.
The price is carefree and astonishingly low.

852 SCIATINO ROSE 1966
[OOrmieel =... a. 1.49 16.10

Most of this delightful Rosé is consumed on this charming Mediter-
ranean island or in the few Corsican restaurants of Paris, Mar-
seille and Nice. A heady Rosé.

497 ALOUETTE, ANJOU
CABERNET ROSE, 1967 ... 1.79 19.35

The noble cabernet grape of Bordeaux is transferred to the Loire
Valley here. There is just a hint of sweetness to round off the flavor.

790 BANDOL ROSE 1966,
Chateau Braquety ......... 1.99 21.50

A delightful vineyard, surrounded by dense woods, that overlooks
the little fishing village of Bandol in one of the most charming
sections of Provence.

834 TAVEL 1966, Vignerons.... 2.29 24.75

Tavel, the most famed Vin Rosé of France, comes from an arid,
rocky little valley between Avignon and Nimes.

(& WHITE BORDEAUX

No. Bottle Case
786 BORDEAUX BLANC 1966,
Domaine de la Marquis..... 2.39 15.00

Medium dry, pleasant and glowing with fruit. Fantastic value.

From a specific small and excellent vineyard and bottled by
“Talleyrand.”

788 GRAVES, SUPERIEUR 1966,
Domaine de Fegron ........ 179 (19.35

A pleasing, relatively dry example of good everyday wine from
the Graves district. Grown at a good vineyard and bottled in Bor-
deaux by “Talleyrand.”

232 CHATEAU FERRANDE 1966
(GPAVGS! 2.29 24.75

Chateau Ferrande consists of 25 acres producing a little over 3,000
cases a year, all chateau-bottled. Mr. Pierre Nicolas of Paris bought
it all because he liked the wine and rightly so. Some of it has
reached us. Our tasting notes read, “beautiful balance, really dry
for Graves, fine bouquet, much finesse.”

857 SAUTERNES 1961, Nicolas . 2.49 26.90
This is not Chateau d’Yquem even though it comes from Sauternes

but it is good. It is rich, golden in flavor and color, decidedly sweet
and a natural dessert wine. A good balance of fruit and bouquet.

205 MOUTON CADET BLANC 1966,
Baron Philippe de Rothschild 2.97 32.10

Discriminating, dedicated care is what distinguishes the regional
selections of Baron Philippe de Rothschild. This charming white is
well-balanced, medium dry, similar in characteristics to a good
Graves. Also available in half bottles at 1.69 each, 36.50 the case.

347 CHATEAU LAVILLE HAUT
BRION 1964 (Graves) ...... 3.19 34.45

The Woltner brothers are perfectionists when it comes to making
wine. This vineyard is adjacent to their beloved Chateau La Mis-

sion Haut Brion and it produces a truly light, elegant, dry white
Wine.

BACK COVER-Bernkastel Doktor vineyard, overlooking Moselle.

769 CHATEAU d’ARLAY ROSE,
Comte de Vogue .......... 2.49 26.90

Usually, a Rosé is made when the juice and skins are left together
for a few brief hours only. In the Jura, from whence this wine
comes, it is possible to have a longer vatting, even for a delicate
color, and that is why the Rosé of the Jura has such sturdy balance.

270 ROSE DE MARSANNAY
1966, Andre Bart .......... 2.79 3075

Here we are dealing with soil not far from Chambertin itself, with
the same grape that produces Chambertin the “Pinot Noir,” and
with the grower who estate-bottled the wine. No nobler heritage
for pink wine exists anywhere in the world. A new high is created
here. By all means, try it.

469 BOURGOGNE “CHAINETTE”
1966, Hopital Psychiatrique. 2.79 30.15

There is a vineyard next to the medieval town wall of Auxerre that
is called “La Chainette.” The vineyard has been owned for cen-
turies by the county hospital which is now devoted exclusively to
caring for the emotional problems of about 1,000 resident patients.
Those patients, whose background is viniculture, cultivate the
vine and tend to the barrels and bottles. They know what they are
doing. They plant in this Burgundian soil only the Pinot Noir grape.
The resulting pink wine is not just good but extraordinary. Also
available in half bottles at 1.54 each, 33.15 case.

 

865 CHATEAU GUIRAUD 1959

([SAUtGrueR) 2... S49 = 37.70

Chateau Guiraud and Chateau d’Yquem are the only first growth
vineyards (official classification of 1855) that are actually in the
Sauternes district. Like Yquem, it is sweet, dramatically rich, and
a perfect dessert wine—particularly in the 1959 vintage. Worth
much more.

405 CHATEAU BOUSCAUT 1964
[eeeves: 3.25 §©635.10

Many authorities consider the elegant, bone-dry, white wine pro-
duced in the Graves district by Chateau Bouscaut one of the three
great dry white wines of the Bordeaux district. Available in half
bottles at 1.75 each, 37.80 the case.

812 CHATEAU CLIMENS 1962
aagteeer ee 2.49 . 37.70

Characteristically, this great Barsac is at its best about 6 or z
years after the vintage. In great years, such as 1929 and 1947, it
even excels Chateau d’Yquem, although lighter.

367 CHATEAU HAUT BRION
BLANC 1966 (Graves)...... 7.95 89.50

All wine literature concurs in the statement, “Chateau Haut Brion
Blanc is the greatest dry white wine of Bordeaux and one of the

great dry white wines of the world.” Less than 600 cases are pro-

duced annually. Hard to come by. All will be gone well before
Christmas. Please order now.

254 CHATEAU D’YQUEM 1959
PaeIeS) 8 ce, 9.95 107.45

The most famous and the most valuable vineyard in the world. Its
15th century Chateau has been photographed ad infinitum. It is
jealously supervised to achieve perfection by the Marquis de Lur-
Saluces. The most consistently expensive wine of the world. It
only producs 50 cases per acre, the lowest in France. In a great
vintage year like 1959, it is truly fabulous with powerful distinc-
tion, finesse, fruit and glorious sweetness. It is to the wine world
what Shakespeare and Goethe are to literature. A true bargain
despite its high price.
