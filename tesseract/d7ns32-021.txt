BARLEY CASSEROLE

Wash 114 cups pearl barley (large). Melt
4 tablespoons butter in a skillet, and in
it saute 3 tablespoons finely chopped
onion. When colored, add barley and
cook until barley is faintly colored.

Remove barley to casserole with cover.
Add 11% cups of chicken broth. Place in
a 350° oven for 25 minutes. Add 1% cup
of pine nuts or slivered almonds sauteed
in butter and equal amount of mush-
rooms—if necessary, add 1 cup broth
and return to oven for 25 minutes.

Variation—add chicken livers, gizzards, etc.

PUMPKIN PIE AUX COGNAC

For each nine inch pie, mash and puree
enough cooked pumpkin (fresh, frozen
or canned) to make 2 cups. Let cool. Stir
in one cup sugar, | teaspoon cinnamon,
— 1 teaspoon nutmeg, 4 cup sliced pre-
served ginger and a touch of ground
cloves. Now add 4 eggs which have been
beaten with 14 teaspoon salt and a cup of
heavy cream. When well mixed, flavor
with 14 cup cognac. Pour into a 9 inch
tin lined with pastry. Bake at 450° for
10 minutes, reduce heat to 350° and con-
tinue baking until almost set in the
center, about 40 minutes. Serve topped
with whipped cream.

If you are looking for the unusual one-
bottle gift that will make the eyes sparkle
and the palate enjoy an extraordinary
taste experience, here are several trea-
sures, among many more, that are worth
serious contemplation: — Ballantine 30
Year Old Scotch in cut crystal decanter;
Sandeman Rare Old Ambrosette Sherry;
a giant size Rheoboam of Moet & Chan-
don Champagne (equals six ordinary bot-
tles); Chateau Montrose 1888; Chateau
Mouton Rothschild 1921; Le Corton
1937; Niersteiner Kehr Trockenbeeren-
auslese 1921; Dom Perignon 1943; Brit-
ish Market 20 Year Cognac; and the
fantastically old Courvoisier Special
Cognac.

I think it was Justice Holmes who once
said, “There is a desire on the part of
every man for the grandiose” —and noth-
ing is quite as grandiose looking under
the Christmas tree than a giant Magnum
bottle—here are just a few that you might
consider: —Chateau Gruaud Larose 1952
(5.15); Corton Bressandes 1953 (6.39):
Chassagne Montrachet, Morgeot, 1953
(5.99); and as for the big Magnums of
Champagne, I can point out Ayala 1949
(9.99 )> Petrier Jouer Brut (12.95.):
Mumm ’s Cordon Rouge 1949 (17.31);
Bollinger Brut 1949 (17.75); and the
classic Bollinger Brut 1947 (19.22).

PRODUCE OF SCOTLAND

..+ For Members of the Bai

While browsing among the bottles in the
shop last week, a particular label,
“Barrister’s Choice” Scotch caught my
eye—and so did the label which looked
as though it had been designed by a con-
temporary of Charles Dickens. I tried the
whisky and it is clean, fine and beyond
criticism. What a wonderful, and what
an appropriate gift to send to your lawyer
friends at only $4.99 the bottle, $58.50
the whole case! And, if you happen to be
a member of the bar the label might easily
act as your own personalized greeting
card.

To a gay and festive holiday!
