One of the noblest of the world’s great wines is undoubtedly Vintage
and Crusted Port that achieves most of its maturation, like fine still
wine, in bottle rather than in cask.

Here are some exceptional examples from the cellars of Richard
Hooper, who was once Lord Mayor of London and the Quinta do
Noval, one of the best vineyards in the Port area.

These vintage ports are not easy to come by, they are much sought-
after rarities in England. This Christmas, you can bring wine joy to
your friends by sending them one of these noble bottles.

If you have not yet experienced the pleasurable wine-drinking joy of
port that bears the date of origin, we strongly advise that you acquire
some—not only for gifts, but for your own drinking delight.
