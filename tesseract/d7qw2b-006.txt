SEND THIS GIFT CERTIFICATE —
THE ‘KEY TO OUR CELLARS’.

Here is an excellent solution for the puzzling question

of whether to send Scotch, Rye, red wines, white wines

or Champagne. Give him a SHERRY WINE & SPIRITS
GIFT CERTIFICATE and let him make his own selection.
A Gift Certificate from our shop gives him the

added advantage of choosing from New York’s largest
selections . . . the assurance of the lowest prices in
town... and a warm and friendly reception when

he comes in to pick his favorites.

Just send us your list of names and addresses, the
amount of each certificate, and the date when you wish
them delivered, or, if you prefer, the certificate

can be mailed to you directly. There is no gayer gift

than this ‘key to our cellars’. uw ?5 upwordo
