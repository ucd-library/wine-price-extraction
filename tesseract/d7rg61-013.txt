Here we are dealing with true collector's items. These larger bottles are not
easy to come by because many vineyards will not go through the exceptional care
and effort required to ship them. However, it is generally conceded by wine ex-
perts everywhere that the longevity of the wine increases in direct proportion
to the size of the bottle, since the ratio of wine to air is therefore reduced.

And here's a tip! Buy these Big Bottles in the Summer while they are still
available and before prices rise this Fall - we will gladly hold your selections
in our cellars and deliver to you in the Fall.
