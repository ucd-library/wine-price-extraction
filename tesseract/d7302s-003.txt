THE GREAT 1959
RED BURGUNDIES

An important wine event is taking place at Sherry’s—the 1959
Burgundies, perhaps the best and most enjoyable of our lifetime,
are now arriving to bring their glory to you.

Even the lesser wines are excellent and the best are fantastically great.
An incomparable year, rich in fruit, well balanced, ready to drink early,
and with all of the warmth and charm associated with such great years,
1947 and 1929. Each wine offered here has been tasted carefully at the
vineyards, and represent the best of Burgundy. Some can be enjoyed
with pleasure now, and the bigger reds will prove delightful in a year or
two.

Practically no 1959 Estate bottled Burgundies worth acquiring remain
in the cellars of the growers. The prices are not out of hand yet, but in
light of present demand, authentic 1959s will be almost unobtainable
in two or three years. We list below an important collection from impec-
cable sources at prices that are based on the low acquisition cost of
over a year ago.

*262 GIVRY 1959... et eo. eee 2.29 25.75

Estate bottled, Baron Thenard

Though Baron Thenard is Chairman of the Board of St. Gobain, France’s
largest glass producer, perhaps his proudest possession is his Ownership of a
section of the Montrachet vineyard. His home and additional vineyards are in
Givry, down in the Chalonnais section of Burgundy. Here he produces a red

wine of finesse and distinction, delightful when young, and a most extraordinary
value.

*277 NUITS ST. GEORGES 1959s 2.29 25.75

Estate bottled, Gilles-Brunet

M. Gilles is the highly skilled cellarmaster of General Gouachon. He owns,
however, a few small vineyards of his own and these yielded, in 1959, a wine
remarkable in its class — well balanced and a spectacular value.

“220 GEVREY CHAMBERTIN 1959. 2.69 29.75

Estate bottled, Pierre Gelin

M. Gelin has a reputation of being one of the best viticulteurs of the Cote de
Nuits. His Chambertin of the Domaine Marion and his remarkable wines from
Fixin have made him famous. In most years he sells his lesser wines, which are
entitled only to the appellation “Gevrey-Chambertin”, to shippers for blending
Purposes. The quality of his 1959 was so extraordinary that we persuaded him

to estate bottle it under his own label. As pleased with it as we were, he agreed,
and the result is an astonishing value.

VOSNE ROMANEE 1959. (si 29.75

Estate bottled, Jean Grivot

Jean Grivot is one of the most active and most intelligent of the younger gener-

ation of vignerons now beginning to make a name for themselves on the Cote

9 r : . ° . ; ite
d’Or. The name Grivot is an old and famous one in Burgundy. Despite its
modest appellation, this delicate, well-balanced 1959 is a wine of remarkable
class.
