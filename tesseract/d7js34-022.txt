One of the most experienced, erudite and reliable is Fritz Hallgarten, perhaps England’s leading
authority, lecturer and writer on the subject of German wines. His book, co-authored with André
Simon, “The Great Wines of Germany,” has recently appeared and is now part of every important
wine library. Each of the ’64s listed below has been tasted by Fritz Hallgarten and three other mem-
bers of his family. Rather than venture our opinion, we thought it might prove more interesting and
informative to you if we simply interviewed Mr. Hallgarten. The notes of the interview appear below:

  

 

  
   
     
  
   
 
  

        

 

AARON: We have been receiving conflicting re-
ports of the 1964 vintage in Germany. You have
been there as recently as early May. What is your
opinion, now that all the facts are in?

HALLGARTEN: There is no doubt that 1964 is the
best vintage since 1959. In fact, it is the most
elegant vintage since 1953. The wines show tre-
mendous style and charm, are less high in alcohol
than ’59s, and their magnificent bouquet and finesse
is already very much in evidence. They are the
ideal table wines for now and for years to come.

AARON: Was 1964 excellent everywhere in Ger-
many, or did it vary from district to district?

HALLGARTEN: In the forefront, I would single out
the Saar and Ruwer wines. As you know from your
experience with the ’53s and ’59s, these wines can
be the most magnificent in Germany when the year
is great. Here I want to emphasize that never have
I seen wines of this extraordinary quality. The wines
of Scharzhofberg, Eitelsbacher and Maximin Gruen-
hauser, for example, are not just simply very fine,
but fantastically so. The Moselles show their very
ripe flavor that they get in sunny years. The Rhines
are round and full-flavored without being over-
whelming, particularly for the American taste, as
some of them were in 1959. But everywhere the
Riesling grape has developed a bouquet, finesse and
elegance which one can only call delightful.

AARON: We all know that there are individual
variations from barrel to barrel among German
wines, even though the label on the bottle might
be identical. Does it necessarily follow that the best
barrel always costs the most?

HALLGARTEN: This is not always true. I fly from
London to Germany almost weekly and I taste very
early in the game before the wine growers them-
selves know what they have. After 40 years of tast-
ing new vintages, I can judge, with a high degree
of accuracy, how a new wine will turn out. It may
sound immodest, but I also know that many growers
along the Rhine and Moselle actually wait for my
visit, and then, based on my findings, classify the
barrels in their cellars as to quality. Naturally, my
firm reserves are fixed first, before this classifica-
tion, and some bargaining is always necessary. But
the growers are life-long friends of mine and I gen-
erally do very well.

AARON: Are you implying that your selection of
1964s generally represent the best of each class
within each cellar?

HALLGARTEN: After all these years, I genuinely
believe this is so. Remember, that every wine on
your list is Original-Abfullung, or estate-bottled.
I can honestly say that you have hand-picked wines
of the 1964 vintage that no other shop in America
can offer.

We have bought a goodly supply of these 1964 wines, all selected by Fritz Hallgarten, and we do not
intend charging what the traffic can bear. Our prices are based on our low acquisition cost and we
are passing the savings on to our clientele. All of these prices will be higher in the Fall.
