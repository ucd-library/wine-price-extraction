Characterized by a distinct “malty” flavor ,and a full, heavy body,
this whiskey is distilled in huge pot-stills and then stored in oaken
casks to age. It is usually made from a fermented mixture of both
malted and unmalted barley, rye, oats and wheat and lacks the
smoky flavor so prominent in Scotch.

Gin is a distilled product of neutral grain spirits and produced, ac-
cording to many varying ‘‘private formulas”, after an infusion of
several botanicals among which are juniper, angelica root, coriander,
cardamon and cassia. The vapors of the heated grain spirit pass
through the berry-head and retain the flavor of its contents when
they are condensed. The type and proportion of these determine
the flavor. “London” or “dry” gins are the kind most generally made
and sold in America and are used in innumerable drinks where a
gin base is essential.

A few “sweetened” or “Old Tom”’ gins are available and these are
made after the English fashion by the addition of a small amount
of simple syrup.

“Holland Gin” or “Geneva Gin’, as it is very often called, is a
Dutch product distilled at a relatively low proof and most always
taken “neat” or with a dash of bitters added. Geneva gin should
never be used in mixed drinks.
