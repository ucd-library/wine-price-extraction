-BEAUJOLAIS

BEAUJOLAIS 1974, Marquis de Roussy de Sales

There is no low-cost Beaujolais that matches this one in
fruit and flavor. The pedigree is impeccable because the
wine was carefully nurtured by the distinguished Marquis
de Roussy de Sales, one of the most respected and capable
growers in Beaujolais.

BEAUJOLAIS VILLAGES 1972, Chateau de La Chaize
Just coming into its own because 1972 was a slow

maturing year. Actually, the wine represents the over-
production of the Brouilly vineyard, Chateau de La Chaize,
A â€˜best buy' for those who want the best of Beaujolais.

MOULIN-A-VENT 1972, Chateau de Moulin-a-Vent
Moulin-a-Vent represents a mid-point in weight and flavor
between the lusty Burgundies to the north and the lighter
Beaujolais to the south, Big, robust and long-lived.
