17/0 AN eS

CHATEAU GRUAUD LAROSE (St. Julien)

Just below the First Growths in the 1855 classification.

LANGOA-BARTON (St. Julien)
One of the legendary Grand Cru chateaux of

St. Julien.

CHATEAU LA MISSION HAUT BRION (Graves)
Haut Brion and La Mission are the two best vineyards
of Graves.

CHATEAU HAUT BRION (Graves)
Power and finesse combine. A great Graves.

CHATEAU LAFITE ROTHSCHILD (Pauillac)
Cost in Bordeaux now up to $300. Order now.

CHATEAU LATOUR (Pauillac)
Deep, full, long-lived.

1972 VINTAGE - Brought the highest opening prices in Bordeaux history.
Because high tannin obscured the fruit during its early

life, 1972 was frowned upon. According to Frank Prial
it is now emerging as the best value in Red Bordeaux
because the fruit is starting to show and the prices are
not just low, but wonderfully so.

1972 VINTAGE continued

CHATEAU CERTAN GIRAUD (Pomerol)

The Pomerols have a winning, generous warmth; depth
of flavor; and a velvety dark color. Here's a good one
at dramatically low cost.

CHATEAU DUHART MILON ROTHSCHILD (Pauillac)
Like Lafite itself, this wine exhibits great elegance.

CHATEAU MONTROSE (St. Estephe)

Because of power and high tannin, we suggest you do
not buy this for immediate drinking but for laying
down. Will be superb five years hence.

CHATEAU PICHON BARON (Pauillac)
A nervous wine -- not yet showing its true stride.
Expected to be much better in a year or two.

CLOS RENE (Pomerol)
The engaging softness and charm of top-flight Pomero|
is apparent here,

CHATEAU GLORIA (St. Julien)

Tasting notes indicate that this may be the best of
the 1972s with the exception of the first growths.
We congratulate Henri Martin, proprietor.

CHATEAU LEOVILLE BARTON (St. Julien)

In a blind tasting, Leoville Barton beat out in the
1972 vintage its friendly, neighboring competitors,
Leoville las Cases and Leoville-Poyferre.

CHATEAU LATOUR (Pauillac)

We salute Chateau Latour--we salute Jean-Paul
Gardere, the man who makes the wine at this great,
great vineyard,

DISCOVERY IN CAHORS! A SUPERB RED!

Qur associate, Michael Aaron, has just returned from France where he found the better
red wines of Bordeaux hopelessly expensive. Where did he turn? He found what he
was looking for 100 miles east of Bordeaux, in the picturesque winegrowing region of
Cahors - an area Frank Schoonmaker described as producing "legendary red wine.....

slow-maturing, remarkably long-lived, of unmistakable distinction."

Another discovery from Cotes de
Bourg. An attractive Bordeaux

priced for daily drinking. Year
after year Haut Guiraud has been
one of our best and best-liked
clarets. This 1972 fully justifies
its popularity. At $2.49 the
bottle, it defies the general
belief that French wine prices
inevitably go up.

His discovery will reach our cellars in mid-April. It is a rich, full CAHORS ROUGE
of the 1977 vintage, produced by Comte de Monpezat (who happens to be the proud _
father-in-law of the Queen of Denmark), It is a wine well worth seeking out -a
wine worth ordering in advance. (No. 807)

= NOW Only $54.50 the case —
