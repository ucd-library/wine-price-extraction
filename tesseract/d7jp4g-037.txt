The choicest vineyards of Alsace are on the slopes of
the Vosges Mountains starting from Mulhouse continu-
ing north to Strasbourg. The Alsatian wines are usually
named after the grape from which they are made such
as Sylvaner, Riesling, Gewurztraminer, etc. Their dis-
tinguishing characteristics are flowery fragrance, rela-
tively dry, but fruity—at their best when drunk within
five years of the vintage.
