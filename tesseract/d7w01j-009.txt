because... BORZOI is not 80° but the original 91.5
proof Vodka...it is distilled in London by James
Burrough, a family-owned distillery since 1820,
now world famous for its BEEFEATER GIN...not
without taste but of good flavor, because it is made
from a special blend of grain, maize and malted
barley...definitely more subtle and drier than the
vodkas of Poland and Russia...relatively new in
America, it already outsells all other imported
vodkas... will make your vodka martini taste twice
as good.

Serve it chilled...the perfect companion to smoked
salmon and Beluga Malossal caviar...excellent as
a -vooka-and-tonic’ or “Tom Collins”’...or just
“on-the-rocks.”’

It commands a higher price than your favorite im-
ported English Gin... but in the spirits of economic
generosity, and to acquaint you with its blessed
virtues, we are putting BORZOI on sale until May
érd...sorry, not permitted by law to quote price...
