1964 ESTATE BOTTLED WHITE BURGUNDIES

Available Fall 1965 and Spring 1966.

As for the white Burgundies, they are generally soft, perhaps lacking somewhat in acidity and
thus destined to be consumed young. They resemble the full-blown 1959s, but they will
undoubtedly be longer-lived for they are not as overpowering in alcohol and thus are better
balanced. One must pick carefully here because there are failures, as well as outstanding

 

successes.

1964 WHITE WINES FROM THE LOIRE VALLEY

Available for immediate delivery.

The fresh, attractive white wines of the Loire flourished in 1964 and proved excellent right
across the board from Muscadet to Sancerre to Pouilly Fumé. The dry summer resulted in
full, fruity wines which, nevertheless, retained sufficient acidity to keep them crisp and fresh.
All of these are now available for your immediate drinking pleasure. Note the precedent-
shattering low prices for Loire wines of such calibre.
