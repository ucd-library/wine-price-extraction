LOOKING FOR “BEST BUYS”?

‘‘New York’s best bourbon value’’ states
James Beard ... and Sam Clay 10 Yr.
Old Bourbon probably costs less than
what you are now paying for general
run-of-the-mill whiskies . . . if you are
looking for the best bourbon in the land,
pacape try Collector’s litem 14 Yr, Old
—it is on sale....

We think there is no better value for the
price conscious scotch drinker than

have you ever tried James Boswell
pcotcn?. .. and from that 250 Year Old
Shrine—Fortnum & Mason’s of Lon-
don, comes their superb Gin and Scotch
--botn on sale... . and from St.
Eamund Hall in the University of
Oxford there is now available the
carefully chosen Cognac, Gin and
Seon ... and §. S. Pierce of Boston
