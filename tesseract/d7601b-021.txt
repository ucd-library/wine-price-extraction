Wine lists in the better restaurants of France and England proudly offer Ayala 1959 as one of the best examples
of Champagne. In our opinion, not many Champagnes, regardless of price, surpass it In breed, dryness and flavor.
We can recommend it without reservation to the discriminating wine drinker.

This special reserve from the famous Pommery & Greno cellars, gaily adorned with the flag of Monaco and a
cameo seal of Prince and Princess Rainier III, is especially imported by us, and would normally cost $8.00 a
bottle if brought in through regular commercial channels. Bone dry and beautifully balanced, it is a happy choice
for festive entertaining.
