CHEVALIER DE VEDRINES
1979

We quote Barbara Ensrud from her WINE column in The New
York Daily News, “One of the best values around is Chevalier
de Vedrines? Made of 100% Sauvignon Blanc grape, this light
straw-colored wine with its flinty herbaceous bouquet of light
intensity has the fresh crispness of a Loire wine. At the astonish-
ing low Sale price of $2.99, we suggest early acquisition to

avoid disappointment.

CaSe€

As in many of the great years, the crop yield was small but of great intensity. Will
thrive for decades in the classic tradition of 45 and ’61. Almost all classified
chateaus are truly superb. Acquire them now before they disappear forever or
become astronomically expensive.
