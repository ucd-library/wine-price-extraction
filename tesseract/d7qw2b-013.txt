This is a slightly different version of the
well known dish from the south of
France, but a very good one. Heat %
cup olive oil in a large skillet or Dutch
oven. Cook two cloves garlic, finely
chopped, for 1 minute and add one
very large Spanish onion or 2 medium
ones sliced and cut into small dice. Add
1 good sized eggplant peeled and diced,
4. medium sized zucchini, sliced but not
peeled, 3 medium sized green peppers
from which the seeds have been re-
moved and which have been cut into
thin strips. Mix these vegetables well
and let them cook over a medium flame
for about 15 minutes, after which add
4 large tomatoes which have been peeled
and sliced. Mix these with the other

vegetables and cook for another 10
minutes, tossing the vegetables all the
while. Cover the pan and allow to sim-
mer for 1 hour. Add 1 teaspoon salt
and 14 teaspoon pepper and mix thor-
oughly. Uncover the pan and allow it to
simmer until vegetables are well cooked
and thoroughly blended. Really the more
it cooks the better it is. Just before
serving pour the contents into a cas-
serole and top with grated Swiss and
Parmesan cheese mixed. Place the cas-
serole in a hot oven—450°—just long
enough for the cheese to melt. Serve at
once. This may be served in its usual
way without the cheese if you prefer it.
However, when I had it this last fall in
a small restaurant in the country with
the cheese I vowed I would always want
it that way from then on.

Two meringues of good size per serving.
For 12 servings, whip 1 pint heavy
cream very stiff and add 3 tablespoons
of granulated sugar and flavor with your
favorite liqueur — Cointreau, Dolfi’s
Framberry or Curacao or even Char-
treuse. Spread the flat sides of the
meringues liberally with the whipped
cream and stick them together in pairs.
Then heap more whipped cream on top
or if you would be very fancy, pipe the
cream through a pastry tube in what-
ever design suits your fancy. And if you
want to add richness to richness, you
may pour either hot chocolate sauce or
a raspberry sauce over the meringues.
