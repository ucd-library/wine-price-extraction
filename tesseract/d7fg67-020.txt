261 BEAUJOLAIS LAMARTINE 1.59 17.95
It is fitting indeed that this superb Beaujolais should bear the name of
the outstanding French poet and statesman, Alfonse Lamartine. He
was born in the Beaujolais country, loved it, and the main street of the
town of Macon bears his name. No ordinary Beaujolais this, but rich
in fruit, to be consumed enthusiastically, and eminently satisfactory
for everyday drinking. A real bargain because surely this would be
good value at $2.

126 MERCUREY . Fe o ; 2.19 24.50
Estate bottled, Baron Thenard

A red wine of finesse and distinction, delightful when young, and
estate bottled by Baron Thenard. Normally 2.49.

*246 CHATEAU DE MONTHELIE .... 2.49 27.95

Estate bottled, Suremain
Just south of Volnay and up a dirt road is the tiny village of Monthelie.
Less known than Volnay, they sometimes achieve the stature of the
good Volnays but cost considerably less. Normally 2.79.

275 FIXIN, CLOS DU CHAPITRE ..... 2.79 31.50

Estate bottled, Pierre Gelin
A sleeper—though the name is not generally familiar to the wine
lover, a good Fixin can often achieve the stature of its neighboring
vineyard, Chambertin. If you can survive without having a great name
on the label but want good wine, by all means buy this one.

398 BEAUNE GREVES .................. aoe 36.25

Estate bottled, Duvault-Blochet
The better vineyards of Beaune are characterized by softness and
lightness, noted for finesse and aroma, and are relatively quick to
mature. Here is perhaps the best single vineyard of this famed wine-
producing town and is a true glory in 1959.

*827 VOLNAY CHAMPANS ........ 2 Sao 36.50

Estate bottled, Marquis d’Angerville
The Marquis d’Angerville who makes his wines the way the Burgun-
dians did it before the war undoubtedly is the best producer in Volnay.
Some say his “Champans” vineyard provided him with his best-in 1959.
In any event, here is a classic wine, of beautiful harmony, that will
be outstanding for many years to come.

*202 POMMARD “CLOS BLANC?” ..... 3.49 39.50

Estate bottled, F. Clerget
The most popular of the Burgundies is certainly “Pommard,” perhaps
because its name is so easy to remember. Most of the commercial ones
that reach the United States lack distinction. An authentic one Is hard
to come by. This is an absolute beauty from a superb vineyard, made
by a skilled grower. Normally 3.99.

279 ALOXE. CORTON .. ee 3.49 39.75
Estate bottled, M. Quenot

town of Aloxe. Here is a splendid, well balanced example.

considerably with age. Great class at low cost. Normally 3.99.

*269 POMMARD, LES EPENOTS 3.69 42.50
Estate bottled, Domaine Parent
If one were seeking the best vineyard, the Montrachet of Pommard, he
would find it at “Les Epenots” It is the kind of wine because of finesse,
bouquet and world demand that should obtain $5.00. A real bargain
for the wine lover.

270 VOSNE ROMANEE,
CLOS DES REAS ..
Estate bottled, L. Gros

The distinguished characteristics of the great wines of Vosne are

lingering bouquet and rich, full character. In the masterful hands of

Louis Gros, Mayor of the town, the Clos des Reas vineyard has

achieved the delicacy and balance in this year that provides classic

distinction.

*282 VOSNE ROMANEE LES
MALCONSORTS oe. = 3.99 45.75

_ Estate bottled, E. B. Moillard
In 1956, on a vineyard tour, we never stopped long enough in any one
town to have our laundry done. The-situation became desperate but
Madame Moillard came to our rescue and arranged that it be done in
her home in one day. We often feel sentimental about her but we don’t
don’t think we depart from objectivity when we state that this classic
wine from some of the best soil in Burgundy reached incomparable

heights in 1959.

‘271 CLOS DE TART .

Estate bottled, J. Mommessin
In the 7th Century, a nunnery was founded in the town of Morey, not
far from Gevrey Chambertin, and the Nuns started a vineyard called
Clos de Tart. Today it is the distinguished property of J. Mommessin.
Big, sturdy, long lived, here is one of the crowning jewels of the
Cote d’Or.

*805 CLOS DE VOUGEOT ..............0.... 4.49 49.75
Estate bottled, L’Heretier-Guyot
The wines of Clos de Vougeot vary greatly from one producer’s cellar
to another, those coming from along the Route National being far
less good than those produced in the upper part of the hillside adjoin-
ing Musigny, Grands Echezeaux, etc. This particular wine comes from
one of the best portions of the Clos. A splendid 1959.

804 CHARMES CHAMBERTIN 4.79 51.50
Estqte bottled, General Rebourseau

Deep, rich, with all of the balance and fullness associated with the

great vineyards of Gevry-Chambertin. The good General is a per-

fectionist and has indeed made a great wine here.

213 CHAMBERTIN, CLOS DE BEZE 5.49 59.95

Estate bottled, Pierre Damoy
The largest and best producer of Clos de Beze is Pierre Damoy. This
vineyard is the equal of “Le Chambertin”, and has the same character-
istics. A big majestic unity. Normally 5.99.
