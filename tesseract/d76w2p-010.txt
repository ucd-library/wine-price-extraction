A discovery from the little village
of Monthelie — soft, fruity, well-
balanced ~ a wine which would
sell for almost twice as much if it
were only labelled (as it usually
was 50 years ago) Pommard or
Volnay.

Pierre Gelin is one of the best wine
makers we ever met. This superb
wine, grown not far from Cham-
bertin is, in our opinion, the best
value in truly great Burgundy we
have run across.
