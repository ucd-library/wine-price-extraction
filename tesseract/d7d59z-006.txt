 

SONOMA AND MENDOCINO VALLEYS

Until recently, the vineyards of Sonoma, only one row of hills to the east, languished without the
recognition enjoyed by the Napa wineries for decades. Most of their good wines were sold in bulk to
prestigious names in Napa or Santa Clara Valleys. This has all changed. Some of California's best
wines are now produced in Sonoma or Mendocino. We happily present the best wines and vineyards

 

of this important wine-growing area to the wine drinkers of New York.

FETZER VINEYARDS

It was the Fetzer 19 74 Cabernet Sauvignon that won
such plaudits at a recent tasting held in New York.
It is the kind of wine that is full of fruit, beautifully
balanced, and intrigues the drinker with its mouth-
filling quality. At $2.25, the Mendocino Red enjoys

i a

the reputation of being the best value in everyday red wine available in this area.

HANZELL VINEYARDS

The J.D. Zellerbach, formerly U.S. Ambassador to Italy,
was a lover of great Burgundy wines. His dream was to
reproduce on a smaller scale, the great Chateau of Clos
Vougeot in Burgundy. Tasters agree that their Chardonnay
stands up against a big white Burgundy, and the Pinot Noir
is on its way to rival a great red Burgundy. His tradition
of excellence is now carried on by the present owners.

quality in the valley since 1876, when the Simi brothers founded
the vineyard. It was during our January trip to California that our
associate, Sam Aaron, presided over a gastronomic seminar that
