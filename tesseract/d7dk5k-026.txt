4s’ Among the most extraordi- a
nary white wines produced ™
= during our generation
Occasionally, in a particularly great vintage
year, the Counts of Kesselstatt put aside in a special reserve (known
as the Schatzkeller or “Treasure Cellar”) a few hundred cases of
their most remarkable Moselles. 1953 was such a year. During
this year, the Moselle vineyards, on the whole, produced wines
which, in elegance and bouquet, have proven among the best of our
generation. The four wines listed below were all honorable occupants
? of this “Treasure Cellar” and each bottle of this limited reserve was
individually numbered at the vineyard cellar.
