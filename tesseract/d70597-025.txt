The pure, colorless brandies

These utterly delicious, colorless brandies,
exceptional when served in a chilled glass
add interest to the dinner party. The fra-
grance of the fruit is impressive and is
captured by the distilling process—we
know of nothing that surpasses these Eau-
de-Vie at the end of a special dinner. Be-
low you will discover the fragrance of the
cherry, the pear, the yellow plum, the
prune and the haunting wild raspberry
flavor of a superb Framboise. They may
be expensive—but a bottle goes a long way
—an ounce of any of these is worth linger-
ing over for an hour at the end of the din-
ner party.

COGNACS & BRANDIES

Brandy is a distillate of any fruit. Cognac
is a distillate of one of the fruits—the grape
—and this product can only be called
‘Cognac’ if it is distilled in a choice and
limited area in southwest France. Un-
questionably, Cognac is the best brandy
of them all, richly endowed with finesse,
elegance, delicate aroma and a harmony
of taste. If you are seeing the best Cognac
of all France, we do not think you can do
better than acquiring some of the ‘Single
Cask Unblended’—every drop of which
was distilled during the excellent 1934
vintage. Do not overlook the remarkable
Armagnacs and distillates from other
regions.
