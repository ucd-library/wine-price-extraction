No. 1973 RED BORDEAUX continued Bottle Case

 

    

856 DOMAINE DE CHEVALIER (Graves) 10.49 121.00
The simplicity of the buildings at Domaine de Chevalier
perhaps belies the excellence of its wines. Fewer than
4,000 cases of this superb red are made each year.
470 CHATEAU DUHART MILON ROTHSCHILD (Pauillac) IO Sy) L272 00
Estate owned by the proprietors of Lafite. Their
'73 is, in simple terms, lovely.
801 CHATEAU GRUAUD LAROSE (St. Julien) 11.49 132.50
The wines of St. Julien are especially popular in
America, because of their good fruit and forward
flavors. If we were asked which wine typified the most attractive
qual ies of St. Julien, we would most likely answer: Gruaud Larose.

73 the wine is full, velvety, and magnificent for present drinking.

OLDER VINTAGES - Older vintages of good Bordeaux are fast dis-
appearing from the market, and the stocks of
Bordeaux negociants and American importers have
dwindled to almost nothing. There are still a few
exceptional wines available, however, and we have

listed some of the best here.

 

 

 

 

  

 

 

 

  

       
      
 
    
 
 
  
 
 
    
     
  
   
  
   
  
   
   
   
      
   
   
    
   
    
  
 
 
 
   
   

We feel it is our obligation as wine merchants to make you aware that the great

1978 red wines of Bordeaux can be acquired now, and at prices that will cer-
tainly prove to be lower than what you will probably have to pay for them in
the future.

 

 

The wine drinkers of the world have quickly recognized the intrinsic excellence
of the 1978s in Bordeaux. The verdict is now in. 1978 is one of the great red
Bordeaux vintages of our generation. It is in the classic, complex, powerful,
long-lived tradition of 1945, 1961, 1966, 1970 and 1975 - wines designed for
laying down that will surely increase in value and excellence with each passing

year.

THE GREAT, GREAT FIRST GROWTHS OF THE 1978 VINTAGE

No. Case

F23 CHATEAU MARGAUX (Margaux) 440.00

Soft, silken, fragrant and beautiful. Mouton gets the crown

for bigness and depth; Margaux achieves it through elegance.

F24 CHATEAU HAUT BRION (Graves) 450.00

Here is power combined with elegance. A remarkable Graves.

 

 

Pe )hC( CHATEAU LAFITE ROTHSCHILD 450.00
ee (Pauillac)
We have watched the Lafite 1961 and
1959 climb to $2,000 the case and beyond.
Lafite 1966 approaches $800, and Lafite 1970
is about $700. Since 1978 may surpass some
; of these as vintage years, what will this 1978
command in 1984?
F26 CHATEAU MOUTON ROTHSCHILD 168.00 os
(Pauillac) (EER)
Baron Philippe de Rothschild, and rr)
many of his friends in Bordeaux, are i.
of the opinion that Mouton Rothschild
1978 achieves a dramatic depth and
elegance and power that mark it as Cixi
one of the best Mouton Rothschilds Ye sii tess. Piste

produced during this generation. This
giant will go fast. We urge early acquisition.

THE GREAT SECOND GROWTHS OF THE 1978 VINTAGE

 

 

In 1855, 62 vineyards of Bordeaux were classified as ‘Great Growths' and these

members of wine royalty were broken up into five growth rankings. With the

 

exception of Haut Brion, the great growths were limited to the Medoc. Since then
the outstanding wines of St. Emilion, Pomerol and Gr

aves share equal recognition.
