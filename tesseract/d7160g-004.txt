Buying wine, in the immediate future, is
going to be a good deal more difficult than it
has been — impartial and unbiased inforrma-
tion and the help of a knowing wine merchant
will be more important than ever. Since 1953
we have not had a single year broadly classi-
fiable as great everywhere in Europe; many
excellent and indeed very great wines have
been made, but one cannot buy blindly as dur-
ing the “fat” years: expert selection is almost
indispensable. To give a few brief examples,
1954 was a poor year in much of Europe, but
excellent in the Rhone Valley and the Chianti
Country; 1955 produced admirable Moscelles
but mediocre Rhine wines; the 1956 red Bur-
gundies were very poor, but the whites well
above average; the 1957s promise to run the
gamut from extraordinary to catastrophic.

Imported wines, in 1958, will not be cheap;
there will be no astonishing bargains. But
there will be plenty of good wines and good
values for those who know how to choose.

RED BORDEAUX

1957. Good, though with some reservations.
Unlike most ’52s and ’53s and many ’55s, the
1957s will develop slowly. Still hard and a
little green, they can scarcely be evaluated
and judged until they have spent a winter in
cask. In April or May we will know more about
them. The crop was very small and whatever
their final quality, they will not be cheap.

1956. Fair. Acceptable small wines, lacking
in body, often rather tart. Not disagreeable,
but few genuinely worthy of a chateau label.
12/7 20.

1955. A great year, though not, by a long
way, “the greatest since 1900,” as some Bor-
deaux producers announced. Probably des-
tined to be overpriced, the wines are well-
balanced, early-maturing, not unlike the ’53s
in character, though with less distinction and
less charm. Excellent Clarets none the less,
better in the Médoc than the ’52s, certainly
deserve 17/20.

1954. Barely passable, thin little wines,
rather pleasant at the moment, and inexpen-
sive (as they well should be). Will not last.
14/20.

1953. Very great, though not in the same
sense as 1945, for example. From the very
beginning the ’53s have been graced with
extraordinary softness, elegance and fruit,
and they are sure to delight us Cat least those
of us who are fortunate enough to drink them )
for another half-decade or more. It would be
unfair to expect such charms to last indefi-
nitely, and collectors who lay them away must
expect occasional disappointments after 1960.
Until then, 19/20.

1952. A great year. Excellent, well-balanced
Clarets, somewhat eclipsed, Cinderella-fash-
ion, by their younger sisters. A better year,
nevertheless, than °53 in St. Emilion and
Pomerol, where it rates 18/20. Even in the
Médoc the ’52s may well outlast the °53s,
though whether they will ever be as good is
certainly doubtful — 16/20.
