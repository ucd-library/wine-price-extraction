1961 CHATEAU BOTTLED

The vintage was so good that even the humblest of
growths made first class wines. Since nearly everyone
seemed to have made a good ’61, it might make good
economic sense to stay away from the First Growths
here. Possibly the greatest vintage of this generation

Bottle Case

Pauillac. We suspect it can take on a First Growth of
a lesser year.
CHATEAU CALON SEGUR......... 6.99 73.50
A St. Estephe possessed of relative immortality. Good
for 30 years.

vintage year is 1961. Big, glorious, ready now.

A collector’s item. Makes a serious bid to being con-

Though less concentrated than 1961, and hailed as the
“Vintage of the Century,” the ’59s are nevértheless in-
trinsically great, despite the dramatic publicity. All of
these can be enjoyed today, with the better ones en-
dowed with at least two decades of vitality ahead.

Bottle Case
CHATEAU PICHON LALANDE... 7.99 86.30
Pauillac. What a delightful claret!
CHATEAU BOUSCAUT............ 7.99 86.30

Of noble Graves heritage. Enjoy it now—or put it away
for a few years for added taste dividend.

St. Julien and bottled by Nicolas. Finesse dominates.
