For those who prefer that their Champagne cost about half as much as their bottle
of Scotch, we unequivocally recommend this excellent example of New York State
Champagne produced in the picturesque Finger Lakes region. Beautifully made, fully
matured, definitely dry, and harmoniously in balance. Will certainly stand up against
those New York State Champagnes that command well over $4.00 the bottle. This
price permits you to serve Champagne as freely as you might table wine, scotch,
gin, or bourbon.

 

S2. WISDOM’S ROYAL BROWN OLOROSO . 1.79 19.95
There are few wines produced in the world that quite achieve the rich, deep flavor, or dark color
depth of a fine Brown Sherry. Here is a typical, fully aged example. Highly recommended between
meals with fruit, nuts or cake, or as an after-dinner dessert wine.

S3. WISDOM’S AMONTILLADO FINO . . . 1.99 22.65

As this name implies, a good Amontillado belongs to the Fino family, but they acquire certain different
characteristics as they mature; the color becomes more amber-like. As in the Finos, they are very dry,
more nutty in flavor and develop greater body. Here is a perfect example of fine Amontillado that
normally commands well over $3.00 the bottle.

Generally speaking, a top-flight Cream Sherry such as this is the oldest and most luxurious of the wines
found in the Bodegas of Jerez. Usually, a fine Cream Sherry of a reputable firm commands $5.00 or
more the bottle. It is no ordinary event to obtain this medium dry, dramatically rich, wine for only
$2.49. We urge that you try it.
