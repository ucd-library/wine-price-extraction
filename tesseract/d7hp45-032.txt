THE GREAT SECOND GROWTHS OF THE 1975 VINTAGE

continued Price per Case

If Acquired Now

CHATEAU FIGEAC (St. Emilion) 89.50
If you like Chateau Cheval Blanc, and are not prepared to pay $194 the case,

Chateau Figeac would be the ideal alternative. Why? The vineyard is adjacent

to Cheval Blanc and produces a glorious wine that is quite its equal in depth,

distinction, and longevity.

CHATEAU LYNCH BAGES (Pauillac) 89.50
Rich, full - almost achieves the depth, richness and weight of its neighbor Mouton
Rothschild. A wine designed for those who like power.

CHATEAU TROTANOY (Pomerol) 99.00
Less than 3000 cases of this great Pomerol are produced a year. A true glory - in

the grand tradition of Chateau Petrus which means mouth-filling, big, vigorous,

and dramatic.

CHATEAU PALMER (Margaux) 99 .50
Outside of the great First Growths, Chateau Palmer consistently fetches the highest

price for its wine than any other vineyard of the Medoc. Adjacent to Chateau

Margaux, it is endowed with similar characterisitcs. Fine, full, great class and

finesse - brilliant future.

CHATEAU LA MISSION HAUT BRION (Graves) PRESS

Distinguishing characterisitcs of balance and finesse. This 1975 will continue to
grow for another two decades.

=COMMENDED ADDITIONS (AS OF 1977) TO THE OFFICIAL 1855 CLASSIFICATION OF BORDEAUX

ccording to the research in preparing for the classic volume, THE JOYS OF WINE, by Clifton Fadiman
1d Sam Aaron, there are several chateaux in Bordeaux that have shown so much merit during recent
»cades, that they are worthy of being considered equals of the Fourth and Fifth Growths of the original
355 classification. Here are several that are truly outstanding - wines of longevity that will flourish

ring the years ahead, and are economically advantageous to acquire at this point in their history -
fore the wine lovers of the world become alerted to their intrinsic merit.

CHATEAU PHELAN SEGUR (St. Estephe) 56.00
Exhibits the richness, tannin, depth and longevity typically associated with St. Estephe .

CHATEAU CLINET (Pomerol) 67.50
The good Pomerol vineyards, in the tradition of Petrus, produce very full-bodied

wines, of splendid nose, and with a gleaming dark ruby color. Only 17 acres

and less than 3000 cases for the world.

CHATEAU GLORIA (St. Julien) CPs
Here we must pause. In our opinion, this is possibly the best value in our 1975
offering, becasue true greatness is combined with the liveable price of $69.95
the case. It is Chateau Gloria that was immortalized recently by Robert Daley

in the feature article that appecred in the Sunday New York Times Magazine.
The wine that Henri Martin, President of the Bordeaux Wine Growers Association,
produced at Gloria in 1975 is truly great and will develop for at least another
decade. Because of world demand, it is possibly the most difficult of all of the
vineyards of the Medoc to acquire, so we suggest ordering promptly. For those
who share with us the belief in the future greatness of Chateau Gloria 1975, we
make a SPECIAL OFFER of $65 the case to the foresighted who order six cases

at one time to be delivered to one address. Many wise wine-lovers are taking
advantage of this unique offer.

PREMIAT CABERNET SAUVIGNON (Romania) 1.99 Ne

In Romania a wine must be made of 90% Cabernet Sauvignon grape to

earn the name. We approached this wine skeptically because of the

price - until we tasted it! Possibly the best value in red wine anywhere

in the United States. Be experimental - don't let the low price discourage
you. You will like it.

COTES DU RHONE ROUGE 1975, La Vieille Ferme (Rhone) 2.49 28.40
The better red wines of the Cotes du Rhone have gone up over 30% at

fruit, wonderful bouquet, utterly charming - ready now.

OUTSTANDING RHINES AND MOSELLES
PRODUCED DURING THE GREAT, GREAT 1975 VINTAGE

1975 is undoubtedly one of the best vintages in recent German wine-growing history. It is in the
great tradition of 1953, 1959 and 1971. Richness, fine fruit and balance are the distinguishing
characteristics. These wonderful '75s come along at the precise time when the highly praised '71s
have more or less disappeared from the market. In balance, the '75s at least equal - or more likely
surpass - the excellence of the '71s. The prices are marching upward astonishingly, so we suggest

PIESPORTER MICHELSBERG, W. Dunweg 3.29 S/e05
The most famous wine-producing village

of the Moselle Valley. Under the new

German wine law of 1971, the Michelsberg

vineyard has been classified as a 'Grosslage’

- or a large vineyard area encompassing a

group of smaller vineyards. This does not

reflect on the quality when the wine is

selected by W. Dunweg who only strives

for the best.

Bernkastel is a fairytale village of gingerbread houses with geraniums

hanging from every window. The wine is light, wonderfully dry and

fragrant, and endowed with a subtle bouquet.

OCKFENER GEISBERG KABINETT, F. Wilhelm Gymnasium 4,29 48.95
In the Saar Valley there is the 200-acre Ockfen slope that produces
some of the steeliest, most elegant and fragrant wines in the world.
This is particularly true in great years such as 1971 and 1975. Would

be a bargain at double the price.

Josephshof is the great vineyard of Graach, owned in its entirety for

The excellence of the vineyard and vintage are beyond dispute. The

Freidrich Wilhelm Gymnasium is a famous secondary school in Trier

on the Moseile. Their stamp on a Moselle label has become synonomous

with outstanding excellence.

SCHARZHOFBERGER KABINETT, Egon Muller Dee 68.30
We quote Frank Schoonmaker, "few wine names are accorded such

unhesitating respect by wine-lovers - this is no more than fair for

there are few wines as remarkable as a Scharzhofberger of a great

year - light, but with great depth of flavor - austere but with fragrance

- the great Scharzhofbergers are not far from perfection.’

SCHARZHOFBERGER SPATLESE, Egon Muller Wie 91.10
From the same noble origin as the Scharzhofberger described above,
but this one is a Spatlese, or late picking. This simply means an even

more rich and concentrated wine. Sheer drama on the palate,

ELTVILLER SONNENBERG, Langwerth von Simmern 3.69 42.10
The Eltvillers never achieve true greatness, but are consistenly good

as a vintage.

STEINBERGER KABINETT, German State Domaine 3.99 45.50
A 12th century vineyard created by monks of the Cistercian Order. It

was taken over by the State of Hessia and is now part of the German
