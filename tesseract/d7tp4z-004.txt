Despite the changes in taste and in production, which
blending has introduced, Scotch from the Glenlivet
district remains, in the opinion of the connoisseur,
the premier whisky of the world.

“These generous whiskies’ as Neil Gunn once de-
scribed them, have made the art of blending quality
malts a joyous task, bringing much reward to the
drinker. Mature blends of aged malt whisky such as
these are not easy to come by.

Here is a rare opportunity to acquire the best of
Scotland at sensationally low cost. Choose the 10
Year—15 Year—or 17 Year Old, and pay hardly
more than the price you now pay for the usual Scotch
whiskies. We suggest early acquisition while our
irreplaceable stocks are complete.
