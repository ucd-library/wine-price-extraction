HOLIDAY;

Editor’s Note: We pridefully note that the
Sunday News of November 18th referred
to our associate, James Beard, as “King
of the American food experts.” Nor are
his gastronomic achievements limited
only to food, for he also contributes
monthly articles to “House & Garden”
on the pleasant subject of wine and
spirits.

And, like all people who love their sub-
ject, he enjoys teaching. Having just com-
pleted the first of a series of cooking
seminars, he is ready to start his teaching
activities once again on January 7th. As
an interesting Christmas gift, the New
Yorker (Noy. 17th) suggests a “paid up
course of six lessons in the cooking
classes of James Beard and Andre Sur-
main, especially if you are on such terms
with the recipient as to make the largess
work to your own advantage.”

During the Yuletide, the “Egg Nog” has
become as indispensable and as tradi-
tional as the exchange of greeting cards
and the singing of Christmas Carols.
After putting up a sturdy battle to refrain
from repeating my favorite recipe once
again this year, I finally had to succumb
under the pressure of 80 requests already
teceived. For those looking for some-
thing of a change in the taste of the “Egg
Nog,” I can suggest enthusiastically the

use of Cognac in place of the customary
Bourbon.

WHISKEY EGG NOG (50 Cups)

Beat 12 egg yolks until light. Add gradu-
ally 114% cups fine granulated sugar and
continue to beat until the yolks are thick
and light in color. Pour this mixture into
a punch bowl which has been placed on
a bed of cracked ice. Whip in one quart
heavy cream and one quart milk and
then add one quart rye or bourbon, very
slowly at first, stirring constantly. Let the
punch settle for a few minutes and lastly
fold in 12 egg whites which have been
beaten until stiff. Serve with a sprinkle of
freshly grated nutmeg on top of each
portion.

We have also discovered that many peo-
ple are fond of punches during the holi-
day season. Perhaps the most popular is
the FISH HOUSE PUNCH. It is delic-
ious, and wins an enthusiastic response
when served. Here is the recipe.

FISH HOUSE PUNCH

Dissolve 11% cups sugar in 1 cup water
and 3 cups lemon juice. Add 3 pints of
dry white wine—and we can suggest
Pouilly Fuisse for this. Mix in 1 fifth
Jamaica rum, | fifth Cuban or Puerto
Rican rum, 1 fifth brandy (Cognac or
Armagnac) and 4 ounces Apricot Li-
queur. Stir the mixture and let it ripen
for several hours. Give it a stir from time
to time during the period. Finally, just
before serving, pour it over a block of
ice in a punch bowl.
