1969 VINTAGE

We know of no better way of testifying to the true excellence
of the 1969 red Burgundies than to simply quote Frank
Schoonmaker’s recently issued Vintage Report, “17969 is an
exceedingly great year in Burgundy, quite in the class with
fabulous 1961... deep-colored, rich, everything that fine Bur-
gundies should be...a few conceivably even 20/20, which is
as high as I can go.” We know of no more persuasive statement
to justify anticipating your future requirements than the ob-
jective evaluation by Mr. Schoonmaker—an opinion shared
unanimously by the Burgundy wine growers’ community.

known great red wine. Estate-bottled, René Roy.

Romanee has created one of the most intriguing and re-
markable red Burgundies we have ever experienced.

OLDER
RED BURGUNDIES

Here are a few rare survivors of famed vintage years of pre-
vious decades. Because of their small size, Burgundy growers
cannot hold on to previous vintages in the same manner that
it can be achieved in the large estates of Bordeaux. As a con-
sequence, they are hard to come by and are much appreciated
by those wine aficionados who love fine old red Burgundy.
Here are a few remarkable examples that we are fortunate
enough to be able to offer you.

345 VOSNE ROMANEE, LA GRANDE
RUE 1967 es ee es er te 9.95 107.45
Because of late picking, this famed two-acre vineyard did
much better than their neighbors during the 1967 vintage.

413 ROMANE E ST. VIVANT 1965......------ 12.50 132.50

produced by Domaine de la Romanée-Conti. Relatively
light, but the soil comes through with distinction and
clarity.

Joseph Drouhin has been kind to our clientele and to us.

its best.

WHITE BURGUNDY
1973 VINTAGE

The yield was record-breaking. The result was that some wines
were too light and thin but others were glorious where they
did not overproduce. It forced us to taste the wines carefully
and choose discriminately so that only the best would reach
you—those with a full quota of body and fruit.

Bears the name of the noble grape—Pinot Chardonnay.
