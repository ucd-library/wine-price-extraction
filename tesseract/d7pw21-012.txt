MALCONSORTS 3.99 45.75

Estate bottled, E. B. Moillard
In 1956, on a vineyard tour, we never stopped long enough in any one
town to have our laundry done. The situation became desperate but
Madame Moillard came to our rescue and arranged that it be done in
her home in one day. We often feel sentimental about her but we don’t
don’t think we depart from objectivity when we state that this classic
wine from some of the best soil in Burgundy reached incomparable
heights in 1959.

3.99 45.75

Estate bottled, J. Mommessin
In the 7th Century, a nunnery was founded in the town of Morey, not
far from) Gevrey Chambertin, and the Nuns started a vineyard called
Clos de Tart. Today it is the distinguished property of J. Mommessin.
Big, sturdy, long lived, here is one of the crowning jewels of the
Cote d'Or.

227 CORTON .... ine ee 4.49 49.75

Estate bottled, Baron Thenard
Here is the favorite wine of Voltaire, who said “I give a very good
Beaujolais to my guests from Geneva but in secret I drink your Cor-
ton.” From a great vineyard with the distinguishing characteristics of
delicacy combined with strength. Normally 4.99.

*805 CLOS DE VOUGEOT _ 4,49 49.75

Estate bottled, L’Heretier-Guyot
The wines of Clos de Vougeot vary greatly from one producer’s cellar
to another, those coming from along the Route National being far
less good than those produced in the upper part of the hillside adjoin-
ing Musigny, Grands Echezeaux, etc. This particular wine comes from
one of the best portions of the Clos. A splendid 1959.

804 CHARMES CHAMBERTIN ........... 4.79
Estqte bottled, General Rebourseau

Deep, rich, with all of the balance and fullness associated with the

great vineyards of Gevry-Chambertin. The good General is a per-

fectionist and has indeed made a great wine here.

309 VOLNAY, CUVEE BLONDEAU 5.29 57.95

Hospices de Beaune
An exceptional Volnay, soft, fruity, with the unmistakable 1959 bou-
quet. Acquired at the annual Hospice de Beaune auction. To assure its
proper development, the wine has been cared for, and bottled in the
cellars of the young Marquis d’Angerville, Burgundy’s leading author-
ity on the wines of Volnay.

213 CHAMBERTIN, CLOS DE BEZE 5.49 59.95
Estate bottled, Pierre Damoy

The largest and best producer of Clos de Beze is Pierre Damoy. This

vineyard is the equal of “Le Chambertin”, and has the same character-

istics. A big majestic unity. Normally 5.99.

1959 WHITE BURGUNDIES

344 POUILLY VINZELLES ................. 1.69 18.50
Estate bottled, Caves des Grand Cru

The farmers of this important wine town in the Pouilly district bring
their wine to the local cooperative where it is estate bottled. The re-
sult is a wine made of the noble Pinot Chardonnay grape, of an excel-
lent vintage year and at a price that is not just good, but astonishing!
We have no other white wine of this class and breed that can be
acquired at this price—hardly more than what one would pay for an
ordinary, undistinguished regional.

*355 BEAUJOLAIS BLANC 1.79 19.95
Estate bottled, Rene Bernard
Beaujolais is more famed for its red wine—but on occasion does pro-
duce some rather remarkable dry white wine that is practically indis-
tinguishable from a good Pouilly Fuisse. Perfectly composed. Nor-
mally 1.99.

1.99 22.50
Estate bottled, La Rochette

We can hardly visit a good bistro in Paris without proprietors con-
fronting us with two bottles stating, “We recommend our wonderful
Beaujolais and Pouilly Fuisse.” We have tasted Pouillys in a dozen of
such restaurants but we are yet to run across one that even closely
matches the excellence of this estate-bottled thoroughbred. Make no
mistake—this one is the best of class and even stands a good chance
of winning “best of show.”

*699 PULIGNY MONTRACHET 4.39 26.50

Estate bottled, Domaine Bavard
The greatest dry wines of France are produced in this township.
Though this wine does not owe its heritage to one of the great vine-
yards, nevertheless it participates in the magnificence of its geography,
and of a great vintage year. Amazingly fine wine for a price as low as
this.

31.50
Estate bottled, Robert Monin
A superb Premier Cru Chablis, reminiscent of the 1947s. Relatively

full bodied, exceptionally depth of flavor for a Chablis, and completely
harmonious. Recommended unreservedly.

650 PULIGNY MONTRACHET 2.79 31.50
Estate bottled, J. Monnot

Let us pause here—the wine only bears the distinguished name of the
valley and not that of the vineyard. Nevertheless, based on our blind
tastings, we generally believe that M. Monnot has produced a fabulous
jewel that need not bow, when a cork is drawn, to wines that exhibit
a nobler heritage on the label.

665 CORTON CHARLEMAGNE 3.49 39.50
Estate bottled, Dubruil-Fontaine

Here is a wine that is in the same class as Montrachet itself. Produced

on the steep hillsides of Corton, this 1959, remarkable in its dramatic

taste qualities, promises many years of greatness. Normally 4.19.

655 CHASSAGNE MONTRACHET,
MORGEOT <2. 950.32 | 3.49 39.50

Estate bottled, Claude Ramonet
The white wines of M. Ramonet, particularly in this vintage, are
among the most perfectly balanced and flowery wines we have ever
tasted. This one has much power and class. Normally 4.19.

620 MEURSAULT CHARMES 3.69 42.50
Estate bottled, J. Monnot

What a fabulous wine the eighty-year-old M. Monnot has produced
here! Only fourteen cases remain and they should be gone before the
Ides of March. Act quickly here.

658 PULIGNY MONTRACHET,
PUCELLES ee a 3.69
Estate bottled, J. Monnot
Candidly, an incredible wine! We prefer this to practically any Mon-
trachet we have tasted and which may command double the price. De-
signed to gladden the heart of the lover of good white Burgundy.

42.50

682 BATARD MONTRACHET . 3.69 42.50
Estate bottled, Domaine Bavard

Like its next-door neighbor, “Le Montrachet,” Batard Montrachet is

similarly one of the great white wines of the world. Normally 4.39—

only 22 cases and then no more.

645 MEURSAULT GENEVRIERES,
CUVEE BAUDOT ..... 4.99 56.50

Hospices de Beaune
The highest bid at the time the candle goes out, at the annual auction
of the Hospices, gets the cask of wine. Tasters tell us this was the
best barrel of white wine at the November 1959, Auction. Our own
palate tells us that this is possibly the best Meursault that we have
ever tasted.

*Half Bottles available $2.00 extra the case.
