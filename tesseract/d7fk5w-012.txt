PORT

We have selected our Ports from shippers of the highest integrity
which we feel is an added assurance of quality. Listed below is a
liberal selection of the various types —Vintage, Ruby and Wood,
which is commonly called Tawny. Vintage Port is produced only
in exceptional years and should be purchased several weeks prior to
use. This is necessary to insure proper rest and prevent the ‘‘crust’’
which is acquired after many years of ‘bottle age’, from slipping
and spoiling the wine. Acquiring its name from its fiery ruby color,
Ruby Port is bottled after a relatively short stay in the cask. Tawny
Port is matured in wood for many years until it eventually loses its
fiery aspect, becoming soft and aristocratic.

BHERRY

This great favorite is rapidly becoming an indispensable item in
any cellar, so varied are its uses and so pleasant. There are so many
nuances in the type of Sherry, all of which have their devotees, that
the following list is necessarily large and comprehensive, but we
believe that every distinguished Sherry is represented and at an
equally wide range of price.

The dry Sherries when chilled, are excellent as a substitute for
cocktails, or if preferred, a medium dry, while the richer types of
Oloroso and Amoroso are suitable with cheese or dessert. We call
attention particularly to our own Belmonte Solera.
