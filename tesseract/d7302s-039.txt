Touraine

LIKE DON JUAN, the true wine lover has a soul so combustible that he is likely to
prove fickle. He swears eternal allegiance to a Chateau Haut Brion today, sings the
praises of a remarkable Montrachet tomorrow, and vows, only a week later, ‘there
never was such a wine as Piesporter Goldtropfchen’’. But this is as it should be—an
unusually fine wine — an expression of nature’s bounty and man’s art — deserves the
recognition and admiration of the drinker as surely as a brilliant novel justifies the
plaudits of the appreciative reviewer. If adventuring among the fine wines of the world
interests you, these pages, appropriately embellished by Samuel Chamberlain’s
photographic profile of France, will surely provide their share of temptation.

Dr. Samuel Johnson is quoted as saying “Claret is the liquor for boys. Port for men,
but he who aspires to be a hero must drink Brandy”. In deference to the good doctor,
we have not neglected the braver aspects of drinking such as Scotch, Bourbon and
Gin. You will find them all here—impeccable examples of the distiller’s art—at prices
below what you are probably accustomed to pay.

We can think of no pleasanter way to launch your Autumn drinking in magnificent
and economical fashion than to alert you to our ‘favorites’—those bottles in our cellar

that we consider outstanding within their class—and in many instances, SENSA-
TIONAL BARGAINS.
