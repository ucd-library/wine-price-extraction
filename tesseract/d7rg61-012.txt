SAINT ROMAIN, 5.99 68.50
Roland Thevenin

Acknowledged as the ‘poet of Burgundy, '

Roland Thevenin is also mayor of Saint Romain.
As a poet, he speaks of his beloved wine as the SAINT-ROMAIN
‘ugly duckling that became a swan.' The swans ee
are the neighboring, world-famous Meursaults - S
the Saint Romain is little-known, unheralded but
quite the equal in any blind tasting. Skeptical?
Try a bottle of our ‘ugly duckling’ and watch it turn into a 'swan.'
