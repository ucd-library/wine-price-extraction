by KENNETH DEAN

HOPIN was born in 1810,
G and died in 1849, having
astounded Europe with his genius
and his brilliance as a composer
and a pianist. During his brief
lifetime he epitomized the Euro
pean Romantic movement. Like
Byron, his public career and his

 

extreme right—Goldsmith.

BIOGRAPHER

thing of the romance of that
rugged northern land, and for
Boswell, it was associated with all
the memories of his native land
—the wild Highland charges, the
flight of Bonnie Prince Charlie,
and all the great battles of Scot-
land’s ferocious and inderendent
past.

Now Scotch Whisky, like golf,
Scotland’s national sport, has
been adopted by almost every
country in the world. To this day
it remains uniquely Scottish, for
no imitation has ever been suc-
cessful—or is ever likely to be! If
James Boswell could return, he
would, no doubt, be pleased to
see how Scotland has conquered
the world with her Whisky, and
even more pleased to take a dram
of this Scotch so fittingly named
in his honor!

private life were merged in single
torrent of passion and blazing
activity, as he fought against the
ill-health that plagued him and
the admirers who besieged him.

His LIASON with Georges
Sand is famous, and has been the
subject of numerous books, in
cluding a novel by Georges Sand
herself.

Vodka (which means “little
water’) is generally thought of as
a purely Russian drink. In fact
it extends throughout Eastern
Europe, and Polish Vodka has
long been recognized as the finest,
and purest, of all Vodkas.

It has in it something of
Chopin's own fire and brilliance.
For national drinks represent na-
tional characteristics. Scotch, for
example, is a quiet, potent, drink,
thoroughly typical of the native
heaths and moors ‘of Scotland.
And Vodka has all the dashing
exuberance and power of the Slav
soul, just as Chopin’s music is the
outgrowth of the Polish culture
in which he was born.

In Poland (and in Russia),
Vodka is usually taken straight,
and chilled, and is served with
ZAKUSKI, small appetizers of
fish or meat. In the United States,
Vodka has become especially
popular as the basis for countless
mixed drinks, with Tonic Water,
orange juice, tomato juice, as a
Martini, etc. This one, that
proudly bears the name of
Chopin, is quite remarkable be-
cause it was born in Poland, took
a sea voyage in barrel to London,
then carefully put in bottle by an
impeccable London distiller, and
now has crossed the Atlantic to
bring its superb qualities to you.

 

Mr. Dean visits Eastern Europe,
the birthplace of Vodka, regu-
larly, for his son is a United
States representative there. His
knowledge of Vodka is remark-

able.

The human spirit often vaults to great heights and achieves
genius. Distilled Spirits can only achieve a satisfactory excel-
lence.

In 1831, T. B. Macauley stated: ‘Boswell is the first of biogra-
phers. He has no second.” Robert Schumann in the same year
greeted Chopin with: “Hats Off, gentlemen—a genius!” And
exactly sixty years earlier Samuel Johnson wrote an epitaph of
William Hogarth which read:

“If genius warm thee, reader stay,
If merit touch thee, shed a tear;
Be vice and dullness faraway!
Great Hogarth’s honored dust is here.”

We proudly present these three uisgebeatha, which is Gaelic
for ‘Water of Life’-—they are all outstanding examples of the
distiller’s art—all of them dedicated to a noble trio of gentlemen

—Hogarth, Boswell, and Chopin.

S| JAMES BOSWELL’S FINEST SCOTCH......$5.99 $68.50
Like Boswell, and like golf, this whiskey is uniquely Scottish.
Light in body, very pale in color, even Mr. Boswell would have
approved.

S2 FREDERICK CHOPIN’S POLISH VODKA..$5.69 $66.00

Bottled at a full 100 proof, this superb spirit from Poland has
some of the dashing exuberance and power of the Slav soul. The
price is astonishingly low when you realize its origin and its
high proof.

$3 WILLIAM HOGARTH LONDON GIN......$4.99 $58.50

Hogarth, who knew the rough gin of the 18th Century, would
be surprised to see just how fashionable gin has become. Here
is the very best of England and worthy to bear his name.
