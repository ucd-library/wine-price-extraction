Sensational Sale — Best of Beaujolais
From the Cellars of

THE RT. HON. ERNEST MARPLES

The majority of these wines sold for $2.95 the
bottle, $32.30 the case only last year. They were
much appreciated and whoever acquired them
came back for more. They are all of the 1966
vintage—an outstanding year in this area—and YOUR
this simply means that these wines are now

coming into their own and some of them will CHOICE
develop to even greater heights two or three
years hence. We also feel that we should report
that the 1966 Moulin-a-Vent is so scarce that,
at the source, from the grower himself, whether
acquired by a French shipper or an American
importer, the current price is in excess of $20.00
the case. We only point this out to show what
an astonishing opportunity these four wines
represent—and at a price that even the most
budget-minded Frenchman would envy!

Now on sale—quantity limited
and irreplaceable!

789 BEAUJOLAIS CHENAS 1966 . 1.79 19.95

Chenas is a quaint wine-growing commune nestled in the very center of the rolling Beaujolais
hills. It matures somewhat faster than the Brouilly or Moulin-a-Vent, and therefore represents
perfection because of its fruity and immediate readiness for drinking this Summer. It is a proud
product of one of the nine Grand Cru Communes of Beaujolais. Serve slightly cool. We know

Considered one of the most typical and attractive of all Beaujolais because of its freshness, full
body, sturdiness and purple-red color. It is the kind of wine that the ruddy-faced growers seek

out at the good local restaurants that dot the countryside between Macon and Lyon.
