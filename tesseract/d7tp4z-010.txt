Size of Rack
13” x 162”

An effective solution, to the problem of
wine storage.

Made of sturdy hard wood and strong metal, it
is immune to ordinary wear and tear...and,
best of all, will fit almost any space since it can
stand vertically, horizontally or be hung on the
wall... if more than one is acquired, the racks
can be built one upon unother.
