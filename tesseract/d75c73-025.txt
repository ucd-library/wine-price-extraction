RHINE AND MOSELLE

We quote from the British publica-
tion, Harper’s Gazette:
‘not withstanding the very
fine qualities which have been
achieved in 1969 on the Rhine and
Moselle, there are two factors
which are detrimental for the
lover of German wine—the short
crop which has had a marked
impact on prices—and secondly,
the revaluation of the Deutsch-
mark last Autumn, combinations,
of which represent an upward
trend of between 20% and 30%
compared to similar wines of pre-
vious vintages.”
The wines listed below have been ac-
quired early, before scarcity and
runaway prices have taken over. All
of them will be here this Autumn.
Now is certainly the time for you to
anticipate your needs, if you are in-
terested in acquiring outstanding
examples of great 1969 Rhine and
Moselle.
The regionals come from the cellar
of Hans Kendermann, one of the
most respected firms of Germany,

 

enjoying an outstanding reputation
on the world market. The ‘original-
abfullung,’ or ‘estate-bottled,’ come
from the most renowned domaines
of Germany. Since these ‘sreats’ are
in short supply, now is the time to
acquire them- all will be here this
Autumn.

CHICAGO TRIBUNE, MONDAY, MAY 25, 1970
BY RUTH ELLEN CHURCH

e IT TAKES A RICH pocketbook to enjoy the great
wines of Bordeaux. But it takes a tycoon—better, eight
tycoons with an aggregate
of around a billion dollars
to Duy 3 distinguished
chateau and operate it,
and to gamble on a de-
layed vintage when nasty
weather at harvest time
presents as dismal a pic-
ture as it did in 69.

The eight tycoons who
bought Chateau Bouscaut
in the Graves district of
France two years ago were
not the first Americans to
venture into French wine-
growing. Chateau Haut-
Brion, one of the great
ones, is owned by the
Dillon family, and in the
Margaux district Alexis
Lichine manages Chateau Lascombes for a syndicate of
Americans.

Bouscaut is described as the second most beautiful
chateau of Bordeaux. Queen of them all is Beychevelle,
but it is a palace of 100 rooms, and Bouscaut has but 20
rooms. It has a living room 65 by 35 feet in size, and other
rooms of proportionate size, so it is not exactly small.

Built in the 17th century, with wings added in the 19th
century, the chateau was completely restored by its
former owners after a fire five years ago.

It is known as Domaine Wohlstetter-Sloan for two of
its new American owners, Charles Wohlstetter and
Howard Sloan. A third owner is Allan Meltzer, and it was
with him and Sam Aaron, wine merchant, author, and
