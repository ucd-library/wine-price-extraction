will find it fruity, light, fragrant and utterly
delicious, particularly if served slightly chilled.
We acknowledge our indebtedness to Georges
Duboeuf, who led us to the Avignon area of the
Rhone where this wine was discovered. (1083)

Silvery pale in color, bone-dry, appetite-whetting,
CLER’ BLANC probably represents the best dry
white wine value existing anywhere in the United
States. From Jean-Ernest Sauvion, the ‘Wine
Wizard of the Loire.’’ (484)

ince the late 19th century,

Lanson has been an inter-

national leader among the
French Champagne houses. Its dis-
tinction has been so outstanding that it
received the royal warrant from Queen
Victoria, which it has proudly posses-
sed ever since.

We recall that in the days when
Sherry-Lehmann first opened its
doors, in 1934, Lanson was the most
respected Champagne. It was the most
in demand during our very first decade
in the wine business, and we happily
report that its popularity persists
today.

You will discover Lanson Black
Label Brut to be rich in flavor, with
good balance. It is also refreshingly
dry, with much character and elegance.
And $17.95 is indeed a low sale price
to pay for a French Champagne of
such high merit. (3)

thusiasm of the
American public as has
Beefeater English Gin.
Only two decades ago,
the name was primarily
associated with a beau-
tifully uniformed guard
protecting the tower of
London and other his-
toric monuments. Now,
should you stop the near-
est passerby and ask the
meaning of ‘‘Beefeater,”’
the response would be:
“the best gin in the
world.” This summer,
why not improve your
dry Martinis and Gin &
Tonics by serving the
prestigious, impeccable
Beefeater Gin. (2004)
