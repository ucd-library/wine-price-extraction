Dear Messrs. Aaron:

We are proud to inform you that Barrel No. 9204 of our 1959 "Kaseler
Hitzlay-Herrenberg Beerenauslese" recently won the highest wine award of
Germany, before a group of connoisseurs, including the Minister of

Interior, Steubinger. Bestowed on it was the fabulous "Weinpreis" as the best
single wine produced in Germany during the great 1959 vintage in competition
with the best of the Rheingau, Pfalz, Moselle, Saar and Ruwer.

Though we are proud of this great honor, we must let you know that there

our personal family reserve and state occasions, the remainder are being
reserved for you.

TREASURED BOTTLES FROM REICHSGRAF VON KESSELSTATT
Collectors’ Item of the Great 1959 Vintage

No Bottle Case
Limited
R1 § KASELER HITZLAY-HERRENBERG BEERENAUSLESE ....... 29.50 Supply

The balance, fruit, distinction has hit a new high mark in our white wine tasting experience. It is the kind of
wine that one does not serve with food, but by itself, reverently, and to quote our Germany wine friends, —
‘on bended knee.’ Upon opening, the bouquet fills the air like a flower garden; it should be lingered over
to capture the maximum bouquet. Itis a true ‘conversation piece’ and glory. To offer its delight to a maximum
number of wine lovers, we must limit the sale to bottles, rather than cases. We suggest early acquisition,
because surely all of these will be spoken for quickly. Available for delivery in July. Fuder 9204

R2 JOSEPHSHOEFER FEINE-AUSLESE, Fuder 9037 ............. 9.95 110.60

Proud recipient of the Golden Kammerpreismunze. A powerful, dramatic wine that nevertheless retains
softness. The best barrel of the famed Josephshof vineyard, owned for over a century by the Kesselstatt
family. Although in the township of Graach, the Josephshof is directly adjacent to Wehlen and is the equal
of the greatest Wehlener — rich, full-bodied, big and fine. Available in July.

R4 PIESPORTER GOLDTROEPFCHEN FEINSTE SPAET-AUSLESE 12.50 142.08

Received the coveted Gold Award of Kammerpreismunze. This wine has a wonderful uncloying sweetness;
soft, dramatic bouquet, and pleasant balance. It is this very wine that was chosen to be served at the banquet

at Bonn, in honor of the visit of our late President, John F. Kennedy, to Germany. Quantity limited.
Available in July. Fuder 9152

R6 PIESPORTER GOLDTROEPFCHEN
ee PR ee 6 fs ed AO. ie dS 29.50 345.00

This noble wine shares the Gold Prize and the Honor Prize with the Josephshoefer. There are less than 10

cases in existence. A bit richer and sweeter than the Beerenauslese that the Reichsgraf von Kesselstatt refers
to in the letter above. Available in July.

SUPERB 1964s FROM REICHSGRAF VON KESSELSTATT (Original—Abfullung)

The magnificent Kesselstatt 1959s are either unavailable or are considerably more costly
than they were five years ago. The same thing must surely happen again to the Kesselstatt
wines of such an outstanding year as 1964. NOW IS THE TIME TO RESERVE THEM.
