THE WINE AND SPIRIT CENTER OF NEW YORK

Twenty-four Christmas seasons have gone by since our shop first opened its doors. From the beginning,
have consistently adhered to the principle of offering wines and spirits of indisputable merit at the lowest
possible prices. The gratifying increase in our clientele from year to year has confirmed the wisdom of this

long-range policy.

We believe this list of holiday values represents an opportunity that cannot be surpassed in the state from the
viewpoint of careful selection and honest value. We have worked long and hard to create imaginative gift
possibilities that you can send your friends and make available to you impeccable wines and spirits that will add

joy to your holiday entertaining.

We cordially invite you to visit us at our shop and share some of our discoveries ... where we will always find
time to discuss your choice, to advise in an unhurried atmosphere... where you will discover that the prices
are the lowest in town... where gift wrappings reflect individuality, good taste and imagination ... where

delivery is reliable... where, in short, Christmas shopping is a joy...
