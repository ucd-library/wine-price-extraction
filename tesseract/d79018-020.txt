This vintage chart is a result of much tasting, careful — and interviews with leading wine
merchants, both here and abroad. A vintage chart can only be used as a rough guide because it is
possible to find poor wines in great years and exceptionally good wines in mediocre years. Hence,

it 1s important to select with judgment and knowledge and never to simply follow the vintage chart
in a mechanical way.

Maturity of the wine also plays a large role in proper selection. A 1942 Chateau Haut Brion tastes
better today than the 1945 which has not yet acquired sufficient bottle age. However, five years
hence, the 1945 Haut Brion would prove superior. On the other hand, a 1947 Chablis may be better
today than its 1937 counterpart because certain wines have a much higher rate of maturation. In
making decisions of this type, the well informed wine merchant can prove to be particularly helpful
