La Chapelle de Guinchay

Beaujolais was at its magnificent best during 1957 vintage; light, exceptional character, here is one of the
best values from the beloved Beaujolais area.

596 GEVREY CHAMBERTIN, COMBES AUX MOINES, 1955.
Estate bottled, Baudot

A majestic wine, reminiscent in depth and bouquet of the good Chambertins. Full, rich in color, and with a
fine future.

232 VOLNAY, CLOS POUSSE D’OR, 1949.
Estate bottled, Chavigne et de Lavorielle

Sheer perfection for present drinking. Here is an authentic survivor, estate bottled, of the 1949 vintage, designed
to please the lover of fine old Burgundy.

395 POUILLY FUISSE, LES BOUTHIERES 1957

Delightfully fresh and charming, with a lovely bouquet. A remarkable Pouilly grown proudly by M. Dondin.

313 CHABLIS CRU VAULORENT 1958
Estate bottled, Domaine Maladiere

Each day the evidence becomes more clear—the 1958 wines of Chablis are entirely delightful and perhaps even
better than the 1957. This one, a Premier Cru, is typical in everything that a good Chablis should be.

GRAACHER HIMMELREICH 1958, L. Federlein

An exceptionally light, delicate and subtle Moselle amaz-
ingly low cost for a fine 1958.

KASELER HERRENBERG 19538. .u...c.ccccccccccccssesssseesoee
Estate bottled, Kesselstatt Cellars

A super 1953 from one of the best estates of Moselle. This
wine cannot be bought at the vineyard today at this low
cost. Only 90 cases and then no more!

SCHARZHOFBERGER SPATLESE 1955 ..................
Estate bottled, J. K. Koch

From what many “Feinschmeckers” consider Germany’s
greatest single vineyard. A “spatlese” of unusual class. Was
a bargain at $3.49—now at this low sale price, a sensation.

LIEBFRAUMILCH 1958, Gebrueder Lob .....................

The 1958 vintage yielded fresh, medium dry Liebfraumilch
that are most pleasing. Here is a good example at low sale
cost.

SCHLOSS VOLLRADS 1955. oun ccccceeccccsssssssssssnsecccssnteeeseene
Estate bottled, Graf Matuschka

Graf Matuschka lives in a 14th Century castle in the midst
of this noble vineyard and personally supervises the vine-
yard and cellar operations. His standards are high and he
has never permitted a disappointing wine to be put on the
market bearing his name. Here is a fine example on sale.

SCHLOSS JOHANNISBERG ROTLACK 19858 ......
Estate bottled, Furst von Metternich

From the most majestic vineyard of them all. Normally
imported to sell for well over $3.00 the bottle, this amaz-
ingly low price has been made possible only by a major
purchase on our part. Ideal for those who like a light, dry
table wine of interest and character. We suggest early
acquisition because Schloss Johannisberg, at this fantas-
tically low price, will be depleted rapidly. Acquire a case or
two for your Spring needs now.
