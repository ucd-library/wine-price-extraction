GLENFIDDICH UNBLENDED SINGLE-MALT 10 YR. WHISKY

WHAT IS MALT WHISKY? Sir Robert Bruce
Lockhart refers to malt whisky as “‘a liquid
gift which exalts the soul” and “goes down
singing hymns.’’ For those who prefer less
impassioned judgments, the original un-
blended Scotch whisky, made only of malt,
remaining untouched for many long years,
has a distinction and superiority of its own.
Some claim it is the local water that makes
the difference. Others the local peat. What-
ever it is, a single-malt, like a fine old cog-
nac, has its own singular character.

The best of the malts come from the High-
lands and the best section is Banffshire,
where Glenfiddich is made. The heart of
Glenfiddich is clearly in the right place.

The distiller defines malt whisky as the soul
of all whiskies than can properly be called
‘Scotch.’ Only a century ago, all Scotch
whiskies were ‘straight malt.’ The truest
clue to a single-malt Scotch is the fact that

it is aloof from the blender. Like a chateau-
bottled wine, it can only be ‘itself’ and rep-
resents a triumph of nature, supplemented
by the skill of a dedicated whisky-maker.

We quote Eliot Janeway, noted economist:
“If a single-malt Scotch is truly great, then
blending can only diminish its character.”
Mr. Janeway also points out that a Highland
malt can develop the perfect degree of
lightness and need not be heavy as errone-
ously claimed by many. Lightness depends
on the original whisky — and Glenfiddich
starts off light.

Despite the pedigree, the price is not stag-
gering — it sells for below $8.99. We urge
that you try it and you will share our enthu-
siasm — we also think you should consider
sending it to appreciative friends who want
to experience unblended Scotch whisky at
its best. (Below 102.00 case).

THE BEST
OF ALSACE

HUGEL has become a
synonym for ‘the best
of Alsace.’ Their Syl-
vaner, Riesling and
Gewurztraminer all
represent distinction
and true excellence.
These are described
elsewhere in this bro-
chure. Our particular
favorite is Hugel’s
‘Riesling Reserve Ex-
ceptionelle’ which is
available at 3.69 the
bottle, 39.80 the case.
