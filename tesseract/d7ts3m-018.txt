ne of the finest of all brandy, and 1s distilled from

Cognac is the nar 7
legally defined

a wine which is made of grapes grown within the

district of France from whence it derives its name. No other brandy

can authentically be called Cognac. It is from the Charente or “inner
circle” of Cognac, which is again divided into districts, that the
choicest brandies are produced. Named in their order of quality,
they are Grande Champagne, Petite Champagne, Borderies and Fins
Bois. Should the name “Champagne”, as used in connection with
brandy be confusing, Cognac historians point out that this term is
merely obtained from the ancient name of the district, which was

once called La Champagne.
The brandies listed in this catalogue were selected from among

the acknowledged leaders.
