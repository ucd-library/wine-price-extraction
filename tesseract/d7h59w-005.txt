The
GOOD
1960
Clarets

We quote from Sherry’s vintage chart which was
jast published, “sandwiched between two great
years, this vintage is somewhat unfashionable.
In fact, the ’60s are better than average wines.
Early heat caused an excellent flowering and the
promise of a big crop. This promise was fulfilled
—but later rains washed away some of the hopes.
The ’60s lacked the tannin and acidity that
would give them a long life. They are very attrac-
tive for current consumption—soft wines with a
pronounced bouquet. A worthy successor to the

58s.
