1966 Achieved the Highest Opening Prices
for a Great Bordeaux Vintage in Wine History

The greatness of the 1966 vintage is reflected in the
happy faces of the Chateaux owners when they
start to talk glowingly about the unique qualities of
their ’66s. Some say that there is a bit less body than
the ’64s but feel this is compensated for by greater
finesse, better balance, and a close similarity to the
highly successful, much-heralded 1953s. It was only
last month that we shared this enthusiasm with the

growers as we tasted, barrel-by-barrel, through the
noble classified vineyards of the Medoc, Graves,
Pomerol and St. Emilion. The blessed touch of
greatness was detectable to the palate and there was
sufficient tannin to provide the backbone for excep-
tional longevity. At the opening, the °66s cost
somewhere between 20° and 30% more than the
same wines achieved in their opening prices for 1964.

All charges and delivery to your home in our regular trading area are included in these prices (quotations based on payment with
order). If there is not sufficient space in your home to store these wines, we will gladly advise you where in New York they can be

stored under excellent conditions, and at modest cost.

All these wines will be available for delivery during the Spring of 1969.

This report will provide a ‘future purchase’

pportunity to those of our clientele who are

articularly interested in obtaining the great wines of Bordeaux early, prior to bottling, and
Eefore they become difficult to obtain or skyrocket in price.
