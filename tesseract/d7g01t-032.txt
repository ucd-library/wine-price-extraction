=i CHARBAUT &

Comparative tastings indi-
cated that both the vintage
and non-vintage Champagnes
produced by Charbaut are ex-
cellent, of good balance, dry
and distinguished.

The Charbaut Brut, modestly
priced at 7.99, will bring joy
during this holiday season for
those who want to serve top-
flight French Champagne at
modest cost.

The Charbaut Brut 1969 is out-
standing—everything that a
good vintage Champagne
should be. Here again, at 8.99
the bottle, we are dealing with
one of the best values in
Champagne coming out of
France.

WYBOROWA
POLISH WODKA

Nobody knows more about
Vodka than the people of
Poland do. Their Wyborowa
Vodka is an experience, es-
pecially as the classic ac-
companiment to caviar. Try
it chilled from a small glass.
Remarkable! (80 proof.)

GRANT’S ROYAL
SCOTCH
12 YEARS OLD

Elsewhere, we sing the
praises of Glenfiddich
Unblended All-malt Glen-
livet whisky. One of the
most important ingredi-
ents in this remarkable 12
year old Grant’s Royal is
aged Glenfiddich whisky.
Our Scotch friends tell us
that it is the high ratio of
this remarkable all-malt
that is the secret of why
Grant’s 12 year achieves
such supremacy and
excellence.

    
     
     
    
 
   
   
   
 
      
     
     
       
      
 
   
   
   
   
 

If you are interested in
Sic kCe aac Se pie Sit.
whether it be for your
own pleasure, or as an
exceptional gift, this one
should not be over-
looked.
