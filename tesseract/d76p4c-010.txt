CHAMPAGNES
OF Comparative tastings indi-

cated that both the vintage and

CHARBAUT on-vintage Champagnes pro-
duced by Charbaut are ex-
cellent, of good balance, dry
and distinguished.

The Charbaut Brut, modestly
priced at 11.99 the bottle,
129.49 the case, will bring joy
during this holiday season for
those who want to serve top-
flight French Champagne at
modest cost.

The Charbaut Brut 1971 is out-
Sstanding—everything that a
good vintage Champagne
should be. Here again, at 15.49
the bottle, 167.29 the case, we
are dealing with one of the best
values in Champagne coming
out of France.

The venerable firm of Hennessey, in commemoration of
America’s Bicentennial, bottled this excellent Cognac
from some of their old, finest reserves to create a
unique cuvee that will inspire admiration among the
most discriminating of Cognac lovers. It is the kind of
Cognac that will easily rival those that command $25
the bottle or more. We suggest early acquisition to
avoid disappointment. (795.00 case)
