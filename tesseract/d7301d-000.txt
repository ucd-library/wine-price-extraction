MY WILL PRICES MARCH UPWARDS? In 1972 and 1973 we were all aware of the wine

Importers caught the fever and overbought. This was followed by a recession, high interest rates

consumer resistance. Sales slowed down and the cautious corporate comptrollers insisted that excess
>ks be liquidated, regardless of loss. This proved to be a bonanza to the wine consumer.

h selling-off process, however, is nearing its end. Current replacements from the European vineyards
ill reflect the higher costs which include inflation, increased labor and material overhead.
- increases must inevitably be the result.

WHITE BORDEAUX is a catch-all name covering many
types of wine ranging from the very dry to the exceed-
ingly sweet. Basically, look to chateau-bottled Graves for
good dry white wine, and look to Sauternes and Barsac
for the dramatic, rich, flowery dessert wines. Here are
the best of Bordeaux-choose among them-note the low
prices.
