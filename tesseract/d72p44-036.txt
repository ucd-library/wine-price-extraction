LILLET as often as Coca-Cola signs are seen on U.S. 1.
The reason—best-selling aperitif of the area—light, pale,

dry.

WILD TURKEY

Audubon drew it... the great, golden bronze bird ...so
American that Benjamin Franklin urged its adoption as
our national symbol... can outrun a galloping horse...
hunters testify to its sagacity ... the Tom wild turkey is
the undisputed master of his harem... civilization en-
croached, and not too many remain in the land... but
we happily report that WILD TURKEY BOURBON is still
among us to add its distinction to your own drinking—
and its uniqueness to your gift-giving.
