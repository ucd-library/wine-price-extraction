THE WoRIO

We can give you prime examples but we cannot give you
prices. Current regulations permit us to quote prices on
wines but prohibit us from quoting prices on Whiskies or
Brandies. However, we know you will find our galaxy of
spirits at least as modestly priced today as you have found
them in the past—simply write or phone for current quo-
tations.

IKE THE GREAT ART MASTERPIECES of Europe,
many of the wine treasures can no longer be
found in the countryside where they were born
but have migrated to London, Paris and New
York. Finding a 1953 of noble heritage is quite

akin to the art collector’s search fora fine painting.

We here at Sherry’s are collectors by instinct. Thanks
to this obsessive habit that has grown through the years,
we are able to offer you here one of the world’s greatest
collections of Old Clarets, remarkable old Champagnes and
an intriguing miscellany of treasures that have been gath-
ered from both hemispheres. Since we believe there is room
in the world of art for an outstanding native American
painter, such as Thomas Eakins, we therefore believe we
should not overlook remarkable examples of America’s
great distilling art.

We know how hard it must be for an art dealer to part
with the numerous works that adorn his wall. We also
know that the responsible art dealer does not charge what
the traffic will bear but adheres to a code of morality when
he sells. In our own small way, we share these sentiments,
as we offer you the most remarkable collection of wine and
— gems that have ever been presented to the American
public.
