EXCITING NEWS FOR SCOTCH DRINKERS! You can maintain a high quality level in your Summer entertaining by
serving one of Scotland’s most distinguished whiskies and yet pay the unbelievably low sale price of $4.59. It is not a product
of an obscure distillery, but was carefully blended, aged and bottled in Scotland by the 178 Year Old firm of Alexander
Sommeryail. Candidly, whisky of this age and calibre would be good value at $6.00 or more

WHITE WINI
MONSIEUR MONNOT, in our considered
opinion, in his extremely small way, iS unsur
passed and_ possibly unequalled among. the
white wine producers of France. His total pro
duction of white Burgundy rarely exceeds ten
small barrels, or 250 cases in all. The wines
that carry his label are treasures indeed, with
an extraordinary wealth of bouquet and flavor,
powerful, and entirely remarkable.

We spent an entire afternoon in his tiny cellar,
just big enough to hold the ten small barrels,
and were astonished by the fabulous quality
of what we tasted. His 1954s were superb, much

amoung the white Burgundies, and his 1955s
can only be described as fantastically great.

OLD FASHIONED
SOUR MASH

News! Old J. T. S. Brown outsold every other bonded Bourbon in Kentucky last year and ranked No. 1 in popularity — no
mean accomplishment indeed in the state that is the birthplace of good Bourbon. This year, Old J. T. S. Brown is celebrating
its 100th anniversary — it goes back to 1855 when the first batch of this now famous Kentucky Bourbon was distilled at
Early Times, Kentucky. Fully matured at 6 Years Old, and bottled at 100 proof, it is certainly one of the best Bourbons
presently available.
