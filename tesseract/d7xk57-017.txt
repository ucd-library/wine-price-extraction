COL COURBE V.S.E.P. (Crooked Neck Bottle) . . . . 5.49 64.87

Col. Courbe, in its interesting crooked neck bottle, is a fine example of the delicacy and aromatic bouquet that
ean be achieved by a well made Cognac.

,
FORTNUM & MASON’S FINE CHAMPAGNE COGNAC 6.99 80.00
This interesting example of dry, English Market Cognac is particularly relished by Cognac connoisseurs. Great
Britain is a nation that takes its Brandy very seriously. Aware of this, the 250-year-old firm of Fortnum & Mason
have acquired some of the best and oldest stocks of Cognac to meet the uncompromising demands of knowing
Londoners.

SINGLE CASK UNBLENDED COGNAC .. . 9.45 108.00

Here is an Estate-bottled Cognac that was produced during a great vintage year (1929) in the most celebrated
part of the Cognac country, “Grand Fine Champagne.” It has remained in its unblended state in barrels from
1929 until the present date. Cognac of this calibre is hard to come by because no more than a few small growers
have the patience and aptitude to put aside, year after year, a distillation of their outstanding vintages.

PRANMNBCISE  SisScCEk (ess)... .. ... . . . *X13.95 155.00

We often hear stories of the remarkable Framboise that was found in the home of the Mayor of local Cure of
one of the small towns in Alsace. Candidly, no matter how remote the source, we doubt any are the equal of
this one. Mr. Hess’ truck and men ascend the mountains to an altitude well beyond 1500 feet to pick the wild
raspberries. Usually, at the end of the day, they do not come down to the distillery with more than 100 pounds
of this precious, elusive fruit. It takes 15 pounds to make one bottle.

RE Goel Y REseRCG hh . 20.75 230.00
Since the early 19th Century, it has been the custom of the Hine Family to set aside the best Cognac produced
during a particularly outstanding year for their own future use—ultimately, this old precious reserve is served
to honored guests on special occasions. For the first time, Francois Hine, managing director of this venerable
firm, has consented to part with a few of these treasured bottles—each is numbered and bears a back label
relating the unique history of the contents, hand-signed by a Hine director.
