Decorative object. The Drum That Keeps Things Cold

HE DRUM COOLER, a choice bit of Americana, captures
with remarkable fidelity the essential features of the early Amer-
ican infantry snare drum — the colors, the American eagle hold-
ing the shield beneath a sunburst, and the banderole where the
regimental designation usually appeared. After long research
and careful adaptation, the ‘Drum Cooler’ that you see pictured
here was finally born. It is the creation of Petra Cabot, the famous designer who
originated the popular Skotch Kooler, beloved throughout the country.
The decorative possibilities in the home are endless — and are limited only by
one’s imagination and ingenuity. Functionally, it is the most versatile of ice
buckets — it holds 300 ice cubes for many hours; can chill white wines twice as
fast; a perfect storage container for bottles androther objects; a useful compan-
ion for the auto or weekend trip. And, best of all, it adds its own individual charm
to almost any room in the house.
