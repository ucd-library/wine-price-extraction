The Corvo vineyards are just east of Palermo and grown

micro-climate producing a full-bodied, dry wine.

We recently reported on the WINE DISCOVERY OF THE YEAR in the
New York Times. The reaction was amazing—hundreds tried the wines
of Argentina’s Andean Vineyards for the first time. The enthusiastic
comments are still pouring in, along with re-orders for additional cases.
We quote one of America’s leading wine writers who recently stated:
“At the very least, they (the Argentine wines) showed they can hold
their own against well-made French and American wines, and ap-
parently they can do it as extremely reasonable prices.”

It is no ordinary event to be able to obtain wines of this quality at only
29.95 the case. In an age of ever-rising wine prices, be among the ‘first
on your block’ to experience the appealing excellence of the wines
produced in the Andean Mountains of Argentina. Surely no open-
minded wine lover can afford to miss them.

Join the odyssey of smart wine lovers who are enjoying these nuggets
of excellence from the mountains South of the Equator.
