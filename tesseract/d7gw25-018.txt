full-bodied, full flavored.

PINOT NOIR, the grape that makes the great red Burgundies; most expen-
sive, scarcest red wine grape of California.

GREEN HUNGARIAN, origin of grape uncertain; in Sonoma gives a pale
dry, pleasant and agreeable white wine.
CHENIN BLANG, the grape of Loire and Vouvray; excellent pale, fresh,
good bouquet; fruity, yet dry. Delightful in summer.
