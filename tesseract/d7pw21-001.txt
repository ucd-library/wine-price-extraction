Here are the 1959s that we sold at higher levels; and because of their ee
popularity, could never keep in supply. : xi
Each is estate-bottled and was selected after much experimental cite
tasting by the discriminating wine authority, Alexis Lichine. vant
They are just coming into their own now and promise to be glorious ee

bottles for at least another two years.

None remains at the vineyard—this offering is limited to our pres-
ent inventory—and we strongly advise early acquisition to fortify you
for a joyous Spring and Summer of pleasant, practical wine drinking
at low, low cost.
