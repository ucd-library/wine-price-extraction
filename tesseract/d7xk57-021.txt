Many of you have
gotten to know James Beard through
Sherry’s, or by reading his informa-
tive books and articles about food
and wine. He comments on some of

his favorites below.

Food and drink never seem to taste
quite as good as they do when dining
on a terrace or under a shade tree, or
in the city after a pleasant stroll in
the park, or along the Avenue. At this
time of year, no other drink is quite
as traditional or as cooling as a Mint
Julep and none quite takes its place
in respect to flavor. There is some-
thing about the blending of fresh
mint and good Bourbon that spells
‘coolth’. With the wonderful Old Jeb
Kentucky Bourbon now on sale at only
$3.69 the bottle, no one can now point
to high cost as the objection to serv-
ing a Mint Julep. So let’s, just for the
record, repeat that time honored

recipe.

First of all, I see to it that I have
plenty of finely pounded ice. I start
about forty minutes before I serve
the Julep by crushing six or seven
leaves of fresh mint with a teaspoon-

ful of powdered sugar in each glass.

TWENTY-TWO

 

I then pack each glass with ice and
pour over enough Bourbon to reach
almost to the rim of the glass. Then,
with a long handled spoon, I stir—
stir—stir, until the glass begins to
frost. At this point I add enough ice
to reach to the top of the glass and
place the drinks in the refrigerator
to mellow for twenty to twenty-five
minutes. When I remove them, if
there is room, I float a litthe more
Bourbon on the top and add a sprig
of mint, well dusted with powdered
sugar. This provides one of the most
pleasant summer refreshers I know
of. Repeat as often as deemed wise!

These are not the rich, lux-
urious fruits of Bordeaux and Bur-
gundy, which will not be here until
mate 1961 or the Spring of 1962.
Xather, they are the beloved county
wines of France, the fresh, young
Swiss wines, and a good sprinkling of
the Rhines and Moselles destined for
early bottling. Right at this moment
you can enjoy, on your country ter
race, or in your city apartment, the
very 1959 wines that are being con-
sumed with delight in Europe today

from the Loire Valley there is a
pleasant Muscadet, the intriguing
Anjou Blane de Blanc, a fabulous
Sancerre and a great Pouilly Fume...
and due at any moment are glorious
examples of Beaujolais and Pouilly
Fuisse, rich in fruit, bouquet and dis
arming freshness (and particularly
wonderful are those now arriving in
the cheerful, 17 ounce ‘“‘Pot’’ bottle de
scribed on the back cover) ...and if
you want to taste the best Neuchatel
and Fendant that Switzerland has
sent us in a long time, try those offered

here.

that we take
our wines rather seriously here. Most
of our offerings have been tasted by
one or more members of our firm, at
the vineyards, where they are grown.

 

    
    
 
        
 
   
     
 
          
 
    
       
       
   
       
    
  
   
  
   
  
     
        
 
 
  
  
    
   
  
   
 
    
   
   
   
     
  
     
  
   
   
   

We make it a point to go to the source
to assure ourselves of prime examples
and basic costs, which are passed on
to you. I have just returned from a
wine and food tour of Europe, and our
associate, Sam Aaron, is there now,
exploring the wine growing areas to
make certain that the best of France,
Germany, Italy and Switzerland is
brought to you.
