FRENCH CHAMPAGNES

The effervescent, carefree joy of these French sparkling wines
will add their touch of delight to your more significant summer
entertaining occasions. EACH IS ON SALE-the French Cham-
pagnes represent the best of that remarkable area—and are
priced dramatically low in light of the high replacement costs
in the Champagne district today. The Haute-Savoie, Bordeaux
and Burgundy also contribute their best to add distinction to
your warm weather menus.

ee a ee. 4.99 53.90
This utterly delicious, bone-dry sparkling wine from the
French Alps is served freely and enthusiastically at the
home of James Beard, America’s leading food authority.

Champagne, making a serious bid to being considered

pagne. At this price, you can serve it without too much
economic concern, throughout the summer.

CAFE DE PARIS BLANC DE BLANCS

BRUT (Berdeaux) 2... 2. <i. ss». 5.09 55.00
The most famed sparkling wine of France is produced
in the Champagne district but the price has now become
astronomic. The reputable firm of Cinzano-Dubonnet-
Cussnier (CDC) made an important decision. They se-
lected some of the best dry white wines of France and
brought out their virtues by using the slow Champagne
process in their limestone cellars in Bordeaux. The result
is CAFE DE PARIS-the fruity, truly dry, and utterly
delicious sparkling wine that may not achieve the ulti-
mate finesse of the best of the French Champagne, but
is wonderfully pleasing at any Champagne reception
where cost’may possibly be a factor. You will be sur-
prised and delighted.
LAURENT PERRIER BRUT RESERVE..... 7.95 85.40
This glorious, dry, outstanding French Champagne will
not reach us until August but we feel we should tell you
about it now. Why? In an age when all famous French
Champagnes hover between $140.00 and $280.00 the
case, it is no ordinary event to be able to obtain one of
the best at $85.40 the case. We have put the first ship-
ment on sale—it will be available in limited quantities
so we suggest you reserve your future needs now.
MERCICR EXTRA DRY... 3)... .2-----. > 8.95 96.65
In blind tastings among French Champagnes, various
consumer tasting panels have proclaimed ‘Mercier’ as
best value within its class—a high honor indeed. World-
famous, truly excellent—dry, without being excessively
so—a Champagne of great distinction.

cellence—and two prime examples of the heights that have

drink American Champagne proudly.

Jack Davies is proud of the magnificent Champagne he
produces in Napa Valley. One of the most interesting is
the dry, salmon-colored Cuvée de Gamay 1970—the equal

who are interested, we also have a few cases of the
Schramsberg Crémant, a relatively sweet, fruity Cham-
pagne that is ideally suited to accompany desserts, and
at the same price.
