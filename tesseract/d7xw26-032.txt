THE RED WINES
OF SPAIN

There is more vineyard land in Spain than in any other country
in the world—less than 3% is Sherry. The best table wines are
from Rioja and some good ones are produced in Valdepenas—
also spotily in a few other provinces. Look for the old vintage
wines of Rioja which are among the best values in outstanding
red wine extant today. For those who want good everyday red
table wine of quality, don’t overlook either the Banda Azul
or the Cune Clarete, both are excellent.

THE WINES OF
PORTUGAL

We think of Portugal in terms of port wine, but in truth, over
90% produced is table wine. Some of the world’s best selling
wines, such as Lancers and Mateus, come from Portugal. The
best white is Vinho Verde—and the best red is Dao.
