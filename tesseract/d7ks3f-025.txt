get hold of these good estate-bottlings.
They are rapidly disappearing from the
German scene. Since 1968 borders on a
disaster in Germany except for a few
unusually good wines that represent no
more than 5% of the total, it is quite
obvious that there will be a marked price
increase for the authentic estate-bottlings
of Germany in the near future.

We know that we will not be able to
duplicate these values — and we equally
know that any astute wine-lover will an-
ticipate his Spring and Summer needs for
German wines now while this vast assort-
ment of excellence is available at these
extraordinarily low prices.

 

 
 

In Germany, no wine can be
estate-bottled if any sugar is
added to the fermentation. Every
one of these wines is a natural
wine, there is no sugar added and
it is estate-bottled by the grower.
Each of these was personally
tasted by Frank Schoonmaker
and represents one of Germany’s
choice selections at phenomenally ent
low sale cost. i. ¥4

‘‘We hardly ever see here in America the sor

They are a good bit older, when they are brought up from the cellar and served, than the
Rhines and Moselles we have been trained to accept. They carry the name of a specific
estate and vineyard, rather than a shipper’s name, or brand; they are unblended, and
made from the incomparable Riesling grape, which yields the slowest-maturing, longest-

lived, white wines of the world.

Of course, if you are interested in the German equivalents of Beaujolais de l'année
or Rosé de Provence—the fresh, spritzig, charming little jobs, perfect with a spring buffet
luncheon or a summer picnic, you have a multitude to choose from. My own preference
would be for a wine of the Saar, of a mediocre year, like 1963 or 1965, but there are
plenty of Rheingaus which will delight you. Buy, if possible, the lesser wine of a great

estate.

For something better, if you want the counterpart of a Bordeaux chateau wine or a
Burgundy estate-bottling, I can only suggest that you follow the pattern of the Wine Lists
of good German Hotels and Restaurants. Here you will find NONE of our popular
American favorites—Liebfraumilch, Zeller Schwarze Katz, Niersteiner—but only estate
wines, with a label that gives name of producer, and vineyard name.

In today’s soaring wine market, these are by far the best white wine values available.

When it comes to vintages, for wines made from the Riesling grape you can safely go
back all the way to 1961 and 1962 and even 1959.

Before these wines were shipped they were all comparatively tasted in my apartment
on East 67th Street with my good friends, Sam Aaron and Joe Stricks, of Sherry’s, and

received our unanimous approbation.”’
