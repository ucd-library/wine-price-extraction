IS LONDON GIN
‘Victoriana’ passed on one good
deed not condemned by the Eliz-
abethian of 1957, gin made in
the best British manner. Fort-
num & Mason continue the tra-
dition with their exceptionally
fine dry London Gin. The ‘bur-
ial’ of Martinis ruined by a
poor gin probably accounts for
more bad temper and broken
friendships than any other cock-
tail. A good Martini should
have only the finest gin obtain-
able as its primary ingredient, so
at Sherry’s we recommend this
relatively inexpensive imported
gin at only $4.79 the bottle
($54.95 the case). Whichever
way you take your gin — this is
the pure, smooth basis for all
your mixtures—it Just can’t

help making friends.

SHERRY—AT ALL TIMES
‘The finest compliment Brittania
could make to the source of her
great Sherry consumption was
to send regularly, each year, a
unit of the Royal Navy to Cadiz,
from whence the officers paid
their respects (and showed the
flag) to the great vintners of
Jerez, who, in turn, entertained
their visitors with typical Span-
ish enthusiasm. The versatility
of good sherry, in all its glorious
depths of color, have made it a
household favorite in all English
homes. Sherry can be drunk be-
fore, during or after any meal
except breakfast (though it is
recorded that General Sir
George Cockburn greeted the
early dawn with a glass of ‘fine
gold sherry’ every day during his
American campaign) and today
there is a type of sherry for every

purpose. Q

 

Fortnum & Mason’s Fino, a
traditional aperitif wine of Eng-
land at $2.99 the bottle ($34.75
the case) and their flawless
Amontillado, rich, fine, carefully
selected and well-aged at $3.49
a bottle ($39.75 the case) are
two of the greatest sherries to
be found at Sherry’s.

WHAT WAS GOOD
ENOUGH FOR
GREAT-GRANDFATHER
When a Britisher drank port in
the days of our great-grand-
fathers only the best was good
enough. To ‘take a glass of port’
with anyone was to sip the finest
product exported by generations
of proud Portuguese, whose liv-
lihood depended on the British
market. Today Port is drunk far
less, but the tradition of its great-
ness is remembered and there is a
definite revival by those who
have ‘followed in their grand-
father’s footsteps.’ Fortnum &
Mason’s Supreme Tawny Port

The fine old wines
and spirits of

FORTNUM & MASON

 

is a fine old favorite, the result
of decades of tasting, and is now
available at Sherry’s at $3.49
the bottle, ($39.75 the case).

So with the wine of Madeira,
it was an early American custom
to enjoy the vintage from this
Portuguese island, George
Washington favored it and Ma-
deira held popular court during
the 18th and 19th century. Rain-
water Madeira is the lightest
and dryest and most suited as a
before-dinner aperitif. It is
equally enjoyable served slightly
chilled as a summer drink. Fort-
num & Mason’s Rainwater sold
by Sherry’s at $2.99 the bottle
($34.75 the case) brings all the
glorious savour of this island in
the sun.
