ON,

Bollinger 1943 are no longer available

in Europe and soon they will be com-
pletely off the maket. If any of these
are your favorites, suggest you acquire
them now ... a new shipment of the
popular Croyden Freres Brut 1947 at

3.99 has just arrived

Having just completed ‘Paris Cui-
sine, I have a particularly sensitive
eye for new cookbooks that may appear
on the market. Three of them have

won my fancy — Anne Serannes
‘Delectable Desserts’ for its charming
Delightful

Drawings by Julien Brazelton — and

and original treatment

the most impressive and beautifully il-

 

lustrated volume by Samuel Chamber-
lain entitled “Bouquet de France,’
published by Gourmet Magazine,
and the nostalgic “Luchow’s German
Cookbook” with illustrations by Lud-
wig Bemelmans and recipes by the
popular restaurateur, Leonard Jan
Mitchell. While browsing among the
bottles in the shop last week, a particu-
lar label, Findlater’s ‘Christmas Carol’
caught my eye. The name intrigued me
— what a happy label to send at Christ-
mas time —— so I immediately decided
to try the Sherry. I can report that
this equals or surpasses in taste merit

any full, rich Oloroso that I have run

RANDOM OBSERVATIONS: —
One of the most delightful and im-
pressive gifts in this catalog, to my
way of thinking, is the ‘Cellarette’
Assortment portrayed on Page 4 —
twelve beautiful bottles of wine in the
hand-painted Cellarette for only 26.50
. another not to be overlooked is the
useful ‘Baby Skotch Kooler’ filled with
nine splits of Champagne (the Bab
Skotch Kooler regularly retails for
5.95, but we seli it to you at our whole-
sale cost of 2.95 which, incidentally,
is equally true of all other containers
listed among these pages) . .#. some-
thing we mentioned last month still .
seems one of the smartest gift items of
them all — ten fine French Brandy
glasses lolding Grand Marnier for
only 8.74 . . a nw innovation among
the Four Compartment bottles — the
Garnier Rainbow Bottle (15.85)
those who like unusual rum will be
particularly gratified if they receive
Barbancourt, the remarkable rum from
Haiti . . . if any of your friends are
going on a cruise this winter, don’t fail
to send them at least a bottle of iced
Champagne in our gay, hand-painted
cooler. The cruise would certainly get
off to a good start if one of these
coolers merrily arrives in the stateroom

before sailing time .. . note our galaxy

mas fun for yourself. You will find
