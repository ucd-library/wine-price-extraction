I has only recently been ascertained
that the French vintages of 1949 and
1950 will be placed in a position of
outstanding prominence, due to the fact
that the vintages of 1951 were—for the
most part—a failure,

For the connoisseur .. . the lover of
good wines , .. the man with foresight
here is an excellent opportunity
to lay down extremely promising wines
at very reasonable prices. It should also
prove to be a sound investment, as the
failure of 1951 will certainly advance
the prices of the 1949 and 1950 wines
within a short period of time.

In 1949, almost every district pro-
duced outstanding wines. In Bordeaux,
Burgundy, Alsace and the Céte du
Rhdne, the ratings are exceedingly high.
Germany, of course, produced its finest
wines of the century.

This brochure lists some of the 1949
and 1950 wines which we believe to be
exceptional for laying down. In many
cases, their supply is limited and should
be exhausted in the not too distant
future. | However, by laying down a
quantity at this time, you will not only
effect a substantial price saving, but
will also have the satisfaction of know-
ing your wines will constantly increase
in stature.

We sincerely recommend buying now. &
You may store your wines free of charge” |
in our air-conditioned warehouse, if
you desire,
