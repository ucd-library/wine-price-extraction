Champagne is an area that deserves particular attention because the May frost was so devastating that the important
Champagne houses were able to harvest, in 1957, only 25% of the quantity they sold. As we look into the future, we can
only predict rationing of favorite Champagnes and the strong possibility of price increases. We are presently able to offer
several Champagnes at attractive sale prices, but we do know that price pressure from France will surely force the
cost upwards this coming Fall.

Don’t let the low price deceive you — here is an authentic 1949 French Champagne
at a price considerably below that which you have been accustomed to pay for native
sparkling wine. You will be delighted with the balance, bouquet and character. Also
available in half-bottles at $2.29, the case of 24 at $48.75—splits at $1.19 each—a few
Bret cases of Magnums remain, at $8.29.

74 POMMERY & GRENO RESERVE RAINIER III BRUT. . .. . 7.50 5.99 68.50

Rarely has any Champagne we have ever offered won such enthusiastic plaudits as the “Reserve Rainier III.” Here is the
very Champagne that was served so proudly at the Prince Rainier-Grace Kelly wedding held at Monte Carlo during the
Spring of 1956. Each bottle bears a gold embossed Cameo seal of the Prince and Princess, indicating the wedding date.
Pommery & Greno did not meet the challenge of supplying the Champagne to the wedding party lightly — this Cuvée was
chosen from the most treasured bottles in their cellars. Candidly, in light of the full flavor, balance and beautiful dryness, we
think this wine would represent good value at $8.00 — at $5.99, we consider it a Champagne opportunity nothing short

of sensational.
