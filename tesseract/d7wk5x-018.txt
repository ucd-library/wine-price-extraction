Because of
countless inquiries about the care of wine, |
was inspired to write an article for ‘House &
Garden’ on proper storage which will appear
in the forthcoming January issue. I do think
it will help clear the air somewhat on this
controversial subject... 1 cannot recall] another
Bourbon that we ever offered that has won
such paeons of praise that are now showered
on our “Collector’s Item of the 1938 Distilla-
tion.” (af 1t 15 Bourbon YOu are sending, LL 4$
well worth the slightly higher price to send
this irreplaceable thoroughbred) ...1 shall also
let you in on another Bourbon secret—we are
receiving, during early December, a handful
of cases of the 1114 Year Old Jack Daniel. It
will cost $15 the bottle, but a true Patity ...
an interesting gift item is the remarkable
Framboise d’Alsace of Monsieur Hess —a
pure distillate of the wild raspberry and well
worth the $15.75 to the Eau-de-Vie fancier
... The plaudits of praise of Clifton Fadiman’s
essay on wine which appeared in our Fall
brochure are still coming in strong...Our
fine New England friends, S. S. Pierce Co.. are
now sending us an exceptionally fine Vodka
and Gin (both to be had at $3.69) ... if any of

 

The Gay Bon Voyage Gift

your friends shall be departing for warmer
climates on a boat cruise this winter, don’t
miss sending them at least one bottle of
iced Champagne in the gay “Le Can-Can”
—the trip gets off to a gay start when this
colorful cooler, filled to the brim with ice
and Champagne, arrives in the stateroom with
your good wishes before the boat takes off ...

other items
which you will find in the rest of this booklet.
But do come in and browse around the shop
and see all the Christmas fun for yourself.
In the meantime, a happy, happy holiday sea-
son from all of us here at Sherry Wine &
