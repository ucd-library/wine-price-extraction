BEAUJOLAIS

Here are the most beloved red wines of France. Rich in fruit,
charm, and innocent attractiveness—wines that do not stress
intellectual qualities, but rather easy sensuality. In short, they
are not wines to be laid down for future drinking but to be
consumed joyously during the first few years of their life. All
of those listed below are from impeccable Sources and among
them there is the Chateau de La Chaize—a vineyard that enjoys

the reputation of perhaps being the best single source of Beau-
jolais of the entire area.

1972 is an interestin

& year in Beaujolais. Those produced on
the flatlands were t

on the better vineyards on the hillsides were more favored and
produced a beautiful] balance of fruit and acidity. The wines

were particularly successful in the better a

Fleurie, etc.
