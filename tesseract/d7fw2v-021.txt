*49-A-1" The number of bottles of
GRANT’S 20 YEAR OLD in decanters
represents a minor fraction of the de-
mand. The whisky is truly superb, the
decanter outstanding. Ordering early is
imperative to eliminate disappointment.

“19-A-4” The mysterious attraction and

goodness of
CHARTREUSE both the yellow and the green has
made it a most sought-after Christmas gift through-
out all of the civilized countries of the world.

““19-A-3” Every once
in a while a star sud-
denly appears in the
galaxy of Cham-
pagne. This year a
great discovery is
CHARLES HEID-
SIECK ROYAL BRUT
1959. Wine tasters
are amazed by its ex-
cellence. Very few
cases have been ship-
ped to America. It
cost 11.95 the bottle,
129.06 the case.

“19-A-2” From a small country
distillery comes this 12 year old
bonded Kentucky thoroughbred
DOWLING. Our comparative
shoppers report that its equiva-
lent in age and pedigree is gen-
erally commanding about $12.00.

*19-A-5” We salute these two great
Cognacs! The SINGLE CASK is un-

blended and of the 1934 vintage. The
GASTON BRIAND is of the 1906
vintage and perhaps the greatest
Cognac coming from France. Very
rare and wonderful.
