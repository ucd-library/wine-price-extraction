BEST BUYS” IN CHAMPAGNE
ST. MICHEL BRUT (Finger Lakes, N.Y)...5.. 4555/3 ee 2.49 26.90

command over $4.00 the bottle. We will match this one, beautifully made and delightfully dry,
with any of them, and at only $2.49. With the cost as low as this, you can serve Champagne
with the same carefree abandon generally reserved for Bourbon or Scotch.

Normally, Pink Champagne commands a higher price than its white counterpart. We have put
this excellent, colorful and gay example on sale.
BOYER BRUT 1964 (Haut-Savoie). .. 2.2.21. - es csc e eet terete eer man sr tt rae 3.49 39.75
If you do not insist that your French sparkling wine needs the appellation “Champagne,” here
is the wine you should drink. They learned their trade in the Champagne district, carried their
craft to the French Alps, grew the excellent local grape varieties and proceeded to make a dry
French sparkling wine that your friends and you will really enjoy. It is dry, of delicacy and
finesse and eminently satisfying.
MARGEL PERE EF FILS BRUT 1961 oo eo i 4.99 56.50
An astonishing Champagne opportunity. Made of selected grapes gathered during the great 1961
harvest. The wine is completely dry, surprisingly good and sensationally priced. Half bottles are

there are Splits at only $1.49 each!
KORBEL BRUT. (Galifornia) .... 22. 9s oe 4.99 53.89
Many comparative tastings indicate that Korbel is a glorious example of great American Cham-
pagne, capable of holding its head high among the giants of France. We recommend it un-
reservedly for those who want to experience the best among our native products.
AVALA GOLD LABEL BRUT 1961 222. 5556 oss sy a ee as ee 5.99 68.50
We have just returned from Europe and we saw this wine listed everywhere we went in Paris
and London. Although it is highly respected in Europe, it is not that well-known here. This
makes it possible for you to drink truly fine Champagne at this astonishingly low cost. Half
bottles also available at $3.20 each; $73.00 the case; and Magnums at $12.80 each, $73.00 the case.
MESNHEH, BLANC DE BLANCS 1060 soi be on ee es eee :> 9.90 68.50

pressed from white grapes, in the choicest wine growing town of Champagne—Mesnil. It is
proudly featured by Nicolas of Paris and has become the Champagne vogue in France. Will
compete with Champagnes that command over $10.
BOLLINGER BRUT (19 oz. Inyperial) | ous. es see es ee te ee 6.35 68.58

Bollinger has learned that often a large bottle is too much, and a half bottle not quite enough.
So they devised an ideal size for two—the 19 ounce bottle—only 7 oz. Jess than the regular bottle.
It costs no more an ounce. We urge that you try it for its practicality and convenience. This size
has been an outstanding success in London for over a year. The wine is outstandingly fine. Also
available in the BOLLINGER BRUT 1961 Vintage at $7.80 the Imperial; $84.24 the case.
