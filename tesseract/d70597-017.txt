Each of these ‘Samplers’ was chosen by a world famous wine authority—
the ‘Bordeaux-Burgundy Sampler’ by JAMES BEARD—the ‘Beaujolais-
Macon Sampler’ by the Rt. Hon. ERNEST MARPLES. Both Samplers
provide six separate adventures in wine tasting (2 bottles of each wine).
After the wine has been consumed and enjoyed, the lacquered wine rack
remains to add its functional beauty to your cellar, kitchen or closet. The
added economic dividends are (1) you pay considerably less than if you
had bought the wines individually, (2) there is no added charge for the
wine rack.

We have just become aware that some of our more foresighted clientele are buying six
wine racks at one time, thus providing for a season’s drinking pleasure—then intend
using the six remaining racks as a physical basis for their wine collection, without cost
to them. To tempt you to duplicate their wisdom. we offer a further discount of 5%
from the prices you see here, should you order six wine racks to be delivered to a
single address.
