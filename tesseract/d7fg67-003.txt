Git MUSCADET 1960 ( Gada). «. s se AS 6G 8s

The delicate dry white wines of the Loire Valley are becoming increasingly popular through-
out the world. One of the most delightful is “Muscadet” which is produced not far from the
town of Nantes. Here it is in all its fresh dry delicacy—sheer perfection for summer drinking
—at the unbelievably low price of only 1.49 the bottle. Certainly one of the most popular
white wines we have ever offered.

nationally, as the very best of Vouvray.
