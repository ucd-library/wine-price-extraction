WLOS UE TART IVO/
A Legendary Grand Cru Burgundy

obert Finigan com-

ments in the Finigan
Newsletter, May 1988:
"T have never been a
champion of the 1983 red
Burgundies.... But from
time to time one encounters
an exception, usually at the
highest levels of expected
quality. The 1983 Clos
de Tart of Mommessin, their jewel of a vineyard in Morey-St.-
Denis, has emerged as one of the most impressive 1983’s currently
available. Slightly tawny in color, velvety on the palate, this wine
expresses typical Clos de Tart style in that finesse is more notable
than power—an especially welcome change from the general run of
'83’s. The wine can last another five years or so, but I would drink it
sooner rather than later, and at $30 or so, you'll be drinking one of
the rare bargains among top-class wines... .”

Clos de Tart 1983 has been offered by other shops for as

much as $900 the case. At only $350 the case, this is probably
the greatest value offered in a decade! (765)

One of the First Fine Wines
From the People’s Republic of China

hina is one of the

world’s new fron-
tiers for fine wines. We
proudly offer a harbinger
of wonderful things to
come from mainland
China—Spring Moon
Imperial Cuvee.
Barbara Ensrud, wine
editor of the Daily News
comments: ‘Fresh, fruity,
off-dry but certainly not
sweet, it’s a perfect choice oe
for those [Chinese] dishes Soe
that are not quite right
with very dry wines... . It has just the right liveliness and fruit to
... complement the food instead of strive against it.”

This subtle and delicious white wine is made from
European grapes, planted in China’s prime grape-growing
area of Tianjin, south of Beijing.

Spring Moon has a delightful floral aroma and a most
pleasing, sprightly, crisp melon/pineapple flavor. It is
perfectly suited to the unlimited delicacies of Chinese,
other Asian cuisines, and summer menus. (382)

Anniversaire d’Or which ory - Tleuwnn: Co
is a carefully selected
blend of Champagne con-
sisting of 300 cases.

This Sherry-Lehmann Cuvee from the Pine Ridge
Napa vineyard is worthy of your attention for many
reasons. It was selected by our tasting panel in competition
with eight alternatives. Unanimously, we thought it was the
best of the lot, and we instructed Pine Ridge to bottle it
under the label of Sherry-Lehmann Cuvee. Sadly, the most
they could give us was 200 cases.

You will find it complex, rich in body, endowed with
subtlety and a good bouquet. It will hold its head high
against a 1986 Meursault from the Cote d’Or. It is the kind
of Chardonnay that should fetch a higher price. (303)
