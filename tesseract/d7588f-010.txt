FIRST SHOWING! The perfectly prepared Extra Dry
Martini of Heublein that can be served proudly di-
rectly from the bottle, a beautifully designed beaker,
It is sufficiently handsome to be a conversation piece,
and yet it costs no more than the ordinary bottle.
Long after its contents have pleased the Martini
drinker, it still remains as a useful, graceful, Cocktail
Shaker. Nor do devotees of the “Manhattan” need
feel disconsolate, for this cocktail can also be ob-
tained in the beaker at the same price.
