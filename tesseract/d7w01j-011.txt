Since the 1940’s!

record high interest rates, and as we face an annual
2% increase in the cost of living, that one of the
staples of our society, PETER DAWSON SPECIAL
SCOTCH, can be obtained here (not everywhere —
but at Sherry’s), at a price that permits you to serve
Scotch as freely as you might an American blend, PETER
Gin, or Vodka.
