110 PIERRE CARTIER BRUT ROSE . 4.95 53.51

Pink Champagne has become the symbol for love and romance ever
since Charles Boyer wooed his beloved with this colorful sparkling wine
in the film “Love Affair”. Outstandingly fine dry example at astonish-
ingly low cost.

36 MARCEL PERE ET FILS BRUT 1961 4.99 56.50
An astonishing Champagne opportunity. Made of selected grapes
gathered during the great 1961 harvest. The wine is completely dry,
surprisingly good and sensationally priced. Half bottles are available
at $2.82 each; $61.00 the case of 24—and Magnums at $11.25 each;
$61.00 the case—and there are Splits at only $1.49 each!

28 MESNIL BLANC DE BLANCS 1961 5.99 = 68.50
Regularly $7.95—sensational at only $5.99! Every drop is made exclu-
sively out of white wine pressed from white grapes, in the choicest
wine-growing town of Champagne—Mesnil. It is proudly featured by
Nicolas of Paris and has become the Champagne vogue in France.
Will compete with Champagnes that command over $10.

155 AYALA GOLD LABEL BRUT 1961 5.99 68.50
We have just returned from Europe and we saw this wine listed every-
where we went in Paris and London. Although it is highly respected in
Europe, it is not that well-known here. This makes it possible for you
to drink truly fine Champagne at this astonishingly low cost. Half
bottles also available at $3.20 each; $73.00 the case; and Magnums at
$12.80 each, $73.00 the case.

5039 BOLLINGER BRUT (190z—handy
bottle size). . . . 6.35 68.58

Bollinger has learned that often a large bottle is too much, and a half
bottle not quite enough. So they devised an ideal size for two—the 19
ounce bottle—only 7 oz. less than the regular bottle. It costs no more
the ounce. We urge that you try it for its practicality and convenience.
This size has been an outstanding success in London for over a year.
The wine is outstandingly fine. Also available in the BOLLINGER
BRUT 1961 Vintage at $7.80 the Imperial (19 oz.); $84.24 the case.

22 POMMERY & GRENO BRUT... 7.75 = 83.39
There are 4 great “Brut Non-Vintage” Champagnes produced in
France—and this is one of them. Can easily hold its own against most
of the very expensive vintage Champagnes produced. As a matter of
fact, we know at least one world-renowned wine critic who prefers this
non-vintage to any vintage he can obtain regardless of price. Recom-
mended to those who want the best and have enough ego-strength to be
able to withstand the withering gaze of their friends who cannot find a
date on the label.

54 CREMANT BLANC DE BLANCS 1964,

Oe ea 9.25 100.00
Phenomenal! It should not be confused with Cramant which is a town
in Champagne. The term means “creaming” which in wine means
mildy sparkling. Here is a young fresh, glorious champagne of high
heritage subdued in its bubbly quality but of great dignity and charm and
of the superb 1964 vintage. Featured at Lutece Restaurant in New York.
A conversation piece, a gourmet’s delight and a collector’s item.

97 CHARLES HEIDSIECK CUVE
ROYAL 1959. . . ; 11.95 129.06

Here, we think we are contending with a Chateau Haut Brion ora
Montrachet of the Champagne District. This 1959 glory (a vintage that
can no longer be obtained even in France today) is just becoming ready
to drink in ‘Cuvee Royale.” It is made exclusively of the very best
of 100% rated grapes that are really expensive at the growers’ choice
vineyards, we only have a few cases left—no more will be forthcoming.
It deserves to sell for $16.00 the bottle—please buy it now for your
Fall entertaining to be sure you have it. Incidentally, the bottle, with
its own individual 19th Century shape, is a work of art and can compete
in a design contest at any museum.

80 MOET & CHANDON DOM
PERIGNON 1961 14.50 156.60

We whisper here. We have very few cases. It is rationed and will be in
short supply next Fall. A bit of advice—please buy it now and put it
away so that you will have some later this year and for your holiday
entertaining.

OTHER CHAMPAGNES AND SPARKLING WINES

2 ST.MICHEL BRUT (Finger Lakes, N.Y.) 2.49 26.90
The American Champagnes produced in the Finger Lakes district of
New York generally command over $4.00 the bottle. We will match
this one, beautifully made and delightfully dry, with any of them, and at
only $2.49. With the cost as low as this, you can serve Champagne with
the same carefree abandon generally reserved for Bourbon or Scotch.
For those of you who prefer the gaiety of pink Champagne, we happily
report that this wine is also available as *“‘St. Michel Pink” and at the
same carefree “Sans Souci” irresistable price of $2.49 the bottle of
“pink”; $26.90 the case.

5020 ST. MICHEL SPARKLING

BURGUNDY (Finger Lakes, N.Y.) . 2.49 26.90
Amazingly, this wine is popular in the United States and in England but
an “unfamiliar creature” in France. Because of this, the Sparkling
Burgundy produced in America is, on the average, quite superior to the
one produced in France even though it may cost only one-third the
price. Here is one of the best ones we have run across and $5.00 gets
you two bottles.

81 BOYER BRUT 1964 (Haut-Savoie) . 3.49 39.75
If you do not insist that your French sparkling wine needs the appella-
tion “Champagne,” here is the wine you should drink. They learned
their trade in the Champagne district, carried their craft to the French
Alps, grew the excellent local grape varieties and proceeded to make a
dry French sparkling wine that your friends and you will really enjoy.
It is dry, of delicacy and finesse and eminently satisfying.

216 GOUIN BLANC DE BLANCS

CAniou, Owe) sc 3.99 43.10
Made from white grapes grown in the Loire Valley using the Champagne
processes of natural fermentation in the bottle. It reflects the fruit and
good cheer of Anjou, one of the jewels of the Loire “the Garden of
France.” Fruity, not dry, but avoiding excessive sweetness; will please
those who do not readily accept the dry acidity of champagne.

131 GANCIA ASTI SPUMANTI
(Piedmont, Italy) . . . . 488 52.70

Asti is an important wine town just south of Turin in the Piedmont.
Famed for its relatively sweet, sparkling wine of which this is an
outstanding example.

99 KORBEL BRUT (California) . . . 4.99 53.89
Many comparative tastings indicate that Korbel is a glorious example
of great American Champagne, capable of holding its head high among
the giants of France. We recommend it unreservedly for those who
want to experience the best among our native products.

37. Almaden Blanc de Blancs Brut
(California). 6.08 65.66

Attractively bedecked in one of the prettiest Champagne bottles we
have ever seen, Almaden offers us the pride of their Champagne cellars,
a sparkling wine made exclusively of Pinot Chardonnay grapes. It is
truly amazing, is produced in small quantity and will stand up
beautifully against any of the French Champagnes. Please try it and
take pride in what can be accomplished in northern California.
