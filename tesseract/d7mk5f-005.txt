 

We have bought a good supply of these wines, have bought them well, and we do not intend
charging what the traffic can bear. Our prices are based on our low acquisition cost and we
are passing the savings on to our clientele. All of these prices will be higher in the Fall. All
of these wines are estate-bottled. Most of them will be arriving during this June, in time to
add their message of good cheer to your good summer living. But if you like good white wine,
and want to set your sights beyond the current season, you will make no mistake if you
anticipate your requirements for the next two or three years.
