Quick to mature, the excellent 1962 clarets are appreciated by
connoisseurs because they carry their full quota of complete-
ness to the wine-drinker who wants to enjoy a great wine
today, and not a decade hence. Few ’62s can be found in
Bordeaux because they have been spoken for by appreciative
wine-drinkers throughout the world.

GHATEAU BONNET 1972. .........55...% 1.99 22.50
From Entre-Deux-Mers and its lovely, rolling hills be-
tween the two rivers, Garonne and Dordogne. The quality
of these wines has improved dramatically in recent
years and they have moved from sweet to dry. Aston-
ishingly good value.
CHATEAU DOISY-DAENE 1970.......... 2.99 32.30
A major portion of this Premier Cru Barsac vineyard is
devoted to the production of traditional sweet Sauternes,
Experimentally, and out of the same high heritage, they

much more than the price you see here.

The best dry white wine of Bordeaux and one of the great
white wines of the world. Less than 500 cases produced.

1967 vintage. A sheer essence in the league with the

for wine. This noble classic proves it when the cork
is drawn, and the richness and bouquet reward your
