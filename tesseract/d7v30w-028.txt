 

 

here is great excitement in the world of American
wine. Although California still predominates,
the excellence of wines from other states is
increasingly being recognized—not only in traditional
areas such as New York, but also among the newer pioneering
states of Oregon, Washington, Idaho, Virginia and Maryland,
as well as many others.
Barbara Ensrud, in her
new landmark book,
American Vineyards,
describes this phen-
omenon in fascinating
detail. As she sees it:

‘“‘Today’s wine-
growers on the North
American continent
are modem pioneers...
“... the exciting thing
is that the wines
everywhere are getting
better and better, and
will continue to do
so. The golden age of American wine lies just ahead.”

There is special excitement for an American wine drinker to
taste a Chardonnay from Texas, or Mississippi and find it not
just acceptable but delightfully good. We can conceive of the
days when our wine tours are not limited to France, California
and Italy, but would take place by car from New York to
Virginia, to Texas, Arizona, Idaho, Illinois and finally New York
State. And of course, Barbara Ensrud’s book American
Vineyards would provide the ideal guide.

New York State is the second most important wine-growing
area in the United States. There is a historic tradition here, and
a continuing spirit of innovation that has produced especially
successful wines from the Seyval Blanc and Chardonnay grape
varieties. The outlook for quality wines from New York State
is very bright.

he superb wines of the Northwest are now truly
coming into their own. Many wine connoisseurs and
those knowledgeable about viticulture feel that
Oregon may provide the best climate of all for
growing the delicate Pinot Noir grape. And selected areas of
Oregon, Washington and Idaho have been shown to provide
fine soil for the growing of the most prized white wine
grapes—Chardonnay and Sauvignon Blanc.
As Barbara Ensrud observes, in her formidable new book
American Vineyards:

“Some experts today feel that the Pacific Northwest has
the potential to be the foremost wine region in America
... in terms of quality. The Pacific Northwest lies on the
same general latitudes as do Burgundy and Bordeaux,
and it has the cooler-climate conditions essential for
great wines.”

homas Jefferson was not only a visionary philosopher

and political leader, he was also one of the greatest

wine connoisseurs in our nation’s history. He toured

the great wine regions of France, Italy and Germany
and imported some of their finest gems for his own cellar—
and Washington’s, Adams’ and Monroe’s as well.

We happily report that the viticultural spirit of Jefferson is
now alive and well in his homeland. We have discovered three
fine wine estates in Maryland and Virginia, from which we offer
exclusive selections. We think Jefferson would have been
proud of these wines.
