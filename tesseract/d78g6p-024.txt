THE HIGHLY REGARDED BURGUNDIES _

ROK 2 8 ae eR renee PENS

When the name of the 18th Century wine house of Joseph Drouhin is mentioned
to native Burgundians, the feeling of respect and admiration that they display
is most impressive. It becomes quite obvious, even to the wine merchant who
makes an annual tour of the vineyards, that no wine maker in France enjoys a
higher reputation for quality, authenticity and continuous devotion to the
highest standards of wine-growing and wine-making.

We can only urge you, when next in Burgundy, that you visit Drouhin's remarkable

cellars next to the palace of the Dukes of Burgundy. Their origins can be traced
to the Middle Ages. The cellars have been classified as an historic monument by

France.

This offering is no minor event for the wine lovers of New York. a ae
are produced in small quantity, are hard to come by, and oe ae e
oat costly Burgundies available so it can only be with muc pri | : :
. this excellent selection, surely one of the finest available outside Burgundy.
