502 NIERSTEINER ROSENBERG SPATLESE 1953 (Fass No. 23) 0000000000000... cn ee
Estate Bottled, Fritz Hasselbach
The wines of Nierstein can be identified by their ripe fruitiness and deserve a high place
among the great wines of Germany. We first developed respect for the name of Hassel-
bach on the label when we first tasted his 1945 and we have found him consistently
topflight in every good vintage since then.

572 RUDESHEIMER BERG ROSENECK 1953(Fass No. 19) cscs, 249

Estate Bottled, Fritz Rucker Erben
SS SO The hill, or ‘Berg, above the town of Rudesheim, look almost perpen-
dicular, yet supports, in the midst of dramatic terracing, some of the
best vineyard land of the Rheingau. Because of the unusual exposure,
the wines on this hill have extraordinary richness and body. Here is
: an impeccable example. Estate bottled by a small, but outstanding
Bed ade nea grower.
SCHLOSS VOLLRADS KABINETT 1953 (Fass No. 27A) cocccccccccceeeccc 3.69
Estate Bottled, Graf Matuschka-Greiffenclau

In great years, the wines of Schloss Vollrads are among the greatest of Germany. The
title “Kabinett”’ is not given lightly here — it means the best of class and extraordinary
wine of great distinction.

RAUENTHALER WIESHELL AUSLESE CABINET Wee ee
Estate Bottled, German State Domaine (Fass No. 292-3)

Though not well known to wine drinkers outside of Germany, the Rauenthalers con-
sistently bring higher prices than the wines of any other town in the Rheingau. No
other wines of the Rhine quite achieve their fruit and flavor. The most important hold-
ings are those of the German State Domaine.

SCHLOSS JOHANNISBERGER CABINET AUSLESE (Sky Blue Seal) 1953 .... 5.95

Estate Bottled, Prince von Metternich
Ss g h<| Perhaps the most majestic vineyard of all the world is Schloss Johan-
nisberg. The wine is sold under many different labels, some bearing
the expression - Cabinet” and some not. First the Orange Seal, then
the White Seal, and best of all, the Sky Blue Seal which is generally
reserved for the “Auslese.”” Today, it is no mean achievement to
acquire any Schloss Johannisberg 1953; drinking a “1953 Auslese”
