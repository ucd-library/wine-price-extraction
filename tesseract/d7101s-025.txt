WINES OF AMERICA

American Wines have now become of age and we are proud of
what is produced within our borders—we take them seriously.
Perhaps we have not yet achieved a Chateau Lafite-Rothschild,
a Montrachet or a Musigny, but we are well on our way. It may
take another generation, but knowledge, dedication, trial-and-
error will move us closer to the ultimate of perfection.

In the interval, it is our responsibility to bring you the best of
northern California and New York State. Each wine listed be-
low has been tasted intrinsically and comparatively.

Bottle Case

MOUNTAIN RED (Almaden) ............ 1.85 19.98
From northern California. Ideally suited for excellent
day-in and day-out drinking. However, for greater econ-
omy, we urge that you buy this very wine in the hand-
some gallon size for $6.60, $23.76 the case of four gallons.

BOORDY RED 1971 (N.Y. State).......... 1.89 20.50
Philip Wagner, former editor of the Baltimore Sun is the
dedicated proprietor. Grown along the south shores of
Lake Erie, using European hybrid wine grapes. Surpris-
ingly good.

BURGUNDY 1971 (Sonoma Vineyards).... 2.49 26.90
Rodney Strong is the winemaker here and his Burgundy
regional represents one of the best values of northern
California.

BURGUNDY 1971 (Beaulieu) ............. 2.99 32.59
Bright ruby in color, with much fruit—from Napa Valley.
ZINFANDEL (Christian Bros.) ........... 3.15 34.02

delightful.

The Barbera grape flourishes in Napa Valley and here
is a prime example.

MRT TA 08 es oh, 3.36 40.35
There is a museum along the shores of the Finger Lakes,
and around the museum are excellent vineyards bearing
the name ‘Bully Hill,’ probably the best red wine in the
East.

The grape of Beaujolais is treated in beautiful fashion at
Mondavi’s remarkable vineyard in Napa Valley.

CABERNET SAUVIGNON (Paul Masson).. 2.99 32.30

Brother Timothy, the cellar master at this noble Napa
Valley vineyard, has won many prizes for the excellence
of this wine—California’s answer to Bordeaux.

BARBERA (Heitz Cellars) ............... 4.49 48.50
The Heitz magic touch unfailingly turns grapes into great
wines. This Barbera, unheralded and without vintage,
will delight you.

CABERNET SAUVIGNON 1970 (Parducci). 4.99 53.90
A big Mendocino red. Much depth and sturdiness.
PINOT NOIR 1972 (R. Mondavi).......... 5.84 63.08

If a Chambertin is to be created in California, it will
probably happen here at the Robert Mondavi vineyard
in Napa Valley.
CABERNET SAUVIGNON 1972

le Ge VGN 7.49 80.90
The Director, Bernard Portet, is the son of the Manager
of Chateau Lafite Rothschild who ‘went west’ to grow

size at $6.60 each, $23.76 the case of four.
DEL MAR RANCH 1974

for an everyday white wine.

Moselle.

Clean, dry, fine. Outstanding value.
CHARDONNAY (Sonoma Vineyards)..... 3.99 43.10

a white Burgundy—dry, soft, much finesse. Outstanding
excellence is achieved here.
GEWURZTRAMINER 1973 (Simi) ........ 4.05 43.80

markable whites.

able vineyard that overlooks Hammandsport and Lake

Beach.

PINOT CHARDONNAY 1972

This the very wine that won the first award in a blind
tasting against the famed white Burgundies of France.
CHARDONNAY 1973 (Spring Mountain) .. 9.75 105.50
Californians drive to the vineyard in the hope of getting
a few bottles because they are aware that this Chardon-
nay is one of the noblest produced within their State.
PINOT GHARDONNAY 1972 (Stony Hill). 9.99 107.95
We quote from THE JOYS OF WINE, “Obtaining a case
of Pinot Chardonnay from Frank and Eleanor McCrea is

one of the great West Coast adventures, rather like the

East Coast thrill of getting third-row center seats for a
Broadway hit. For those who care, each is worth what-
ever effort or cost is entailed.”
LATE HARVESTED CHENIN BLANG

4973 (Callaway) 62... 6 15.00 162.00
A sensation! One of the few California wines ever rated
20 out of 20. A first cousin to a German Beerenauslese.
Much richness, astonishing bouquet, and fruit.
