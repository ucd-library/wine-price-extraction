“THE WINES OF CHILE

gill ov a a \y

The history of wine making goes back to the mid 16th Century *

in Chile and there are many wine critics who consider it the
best of the non-European wines. Below we offer only the best
of Chile—wines made from noble grape varieties and from the
best sections of the vineyard. You will find them astonishingly
good—they bear little resemblance to the pleasant, non-descript
little Chilean wines that have been shipped to the United States
up to now.
