We were delighted this Summer to receive a copy ofthe distinguished Canadian magazine The Wine Press. Inside

was an article by Konrad Ejbich which paid Sherry-Lehmann a rather nice tribute, proclaiming us ‘'the

CHATEAU LAFITE of the retail trade-’
We don't often blow our own horn—but we think he is right.

Sherry-Lehmann is more than a shop on Madison Avenue. More
than a catalogue that thousands of clientele receive in the mail.

We are a staff of salespeople, cellarmen, warehousemen, drivers
and office people—each of whom works very hard to make
Sherry’s the best, most interesting wine shop in the country.

We are a delivery service that covers all of New York State—at
no extra charge in most cases.

We are a place where you will find the best in new releases (often
bottled exclusively for us)—the finest in older vintages—and
answers to just about any wine question you can think of.

So phone us. Vist our shop. Or simply fill in the enclosed order
form. Let Sherry-Lehmann be your own private wine cellar this
Autumn—and from now on.
