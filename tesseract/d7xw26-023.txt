1966 CHATEAU BOTTLED

A great. great claret year—a worthy successor to the classic
‘61s—and an excellent precursor to the ’70s. In the grand tradi-
dition—beautifully balanced—long-lived. Rapidly disappearing
off the market.

Bottle Case

CHATEAU FOURGAS-HOSTEIN .....--- 4.49 48.50
Important Medoc vineyard recently acquired by a group
of Americans, inlcuding our good friend, Frederick Pal-
mer, a director of the Chemical Bank. Excellent balance
of finesse and flavor.
CHATEAU DUHART MILON

ROTHSCHILD 6.99 75.50
Exceptional elegance, classic. Adjacent to Lafite Roths-
child and under the same ownership.

CTIA TEAU PIGEAG. © ee ets 2 tne es 7.99 86.30
One of the ‘greats’ of St. Emilion. Worth much more.
CHATEAU L’ANGELUS .......---+:-:>: 7.99 86.30
Only 6 cases remain.
CHATEAU COS D’ESTOURNEL.......-- 9.95 107.45
High in tannin, extremely long-lived.
CHATEAU LYNCH BAGES.......------:: 11.95 129.05
Pauillac. No longer available in Bordeaux.
CARRUADES DE CHATEAU

LAFITE ROTHSCHILD ......------::: 14.50 156.60

Grown and chateau-bottled at Lafite Rothschild. The
only difference is that the vines are younger. Chateau
Lafite has abandoned this practice-so soon this truly
great wine will become a collector’s item.

CHATEAU LA MISSION HAUT BRION..14.95 161.45
An exalted Graves. In England, it has won the highest
praise from the Wine Writers Circle. Excellent, will live

long.

CHATEAU LEOVILLE LASCASES «2i5 : 17.95 193.85
Only 9 cases remain.
CHATEAU AUSONE ........--:++++-:::> 19.95 215.45

A great St. Emilion. Only a few irreplaceable cases re-
main.

CHATEAU CHEVAL BLANC.........--- 22.50 243.00
The jewel of St. Emilion. As we go to press, the lowest
prevailing wholesale price in Bordeaux is $300.00.
CHATEAU HAUT BRION .....-.-------: 24.50 267.30
Great distinction, power and finesse. The perfect wine
for laying down.

CHATEAU MARGAUX ........---++:--> 29.95 323.45
Margaux. What depth and finesse!
CHATEAU MOUTON ROTHSCHILD. .... 32.50 351.00

Despite the fact that the trade replacement cost in Bor-
deaux is over $450.00, we courageously offer this classic
until our limited inventory is exhausted.

CHATEAU LAFITE ROTHSCHILD....... 34.95 377.45
From what is possibly the greatest red wine vineyard of
the world. :

CHATEAU PETRUS. .». ui cece cas ees-- 45.00

Bottle Case

PE RTEAI CAPET i620 56 2.89 31.20
A superior St. Emilion. Now has sufficient bottle age to
make it outstanding in taste and in value. Should you
pull the cork and taste it, we suspect you will come back
for more, again and again.

CHATEAU GRAND-PONTET .......----- 4.49 48.50
A 1964 chateau-bottled Pomerol, (because 90% has al-
ready been consumed) is now classified as a rarity. Here
is a glorious example that we are fortunate to be able to

bring to you.

CHATEAU GLUORMS «- eee ete tts ce 5.99 64.70
A superb St. Julien. The equal of Leoville.
CHATEAU LAFON HOGHG! 664 st 6.49 70.10
Classified ‘Grand Cru’ St. Estephe in 1855. Superb.
CHATEAU DUHART MILON

8.95 96.65

ROTHSCHILD
In Pauillac, you will find this vineyard right next-door to
Lafite Rothschild and the same owner. Magnificent.

CHATEAU MARGAUX ......----++++++: 23.75 256.50
The only ‘first growth’ in the commune of Margaux.

CHATEAU HAUT BRION........-------: 24.95 269.45
Possibly the greatest of the 64s. Should be acquired now.

CHATEAU LATOUR ......--:-+++-+<053 29.50 318.60
The wholesale cost in Bordeaux is over $300.00 the case
obviously, this offer must be limited to our inventory.
CHATEAU LAFITE ROTHSCHILD....... 34.95 - 377.45
A rarity—the price has climbed and climbed and will
continue to climb—if it will be available at all two or
three years hence.

CHATEAU MOUTON ROTHSCHILD..... 37.50 405.00
Rich, full, great. The most exalted ’64, in our opinion, of
the Medoc.

CHATEAU PETRUS .. .. - -c sie +05 ee 45.00
One of the classics of our generation. Very rare.

1962 CHATEAU BOTTLED

Quick to mature, the excellent 1962 clarets are appreciated by
connoisseurs because they carry their full quota of complete-

ness to the wine-drinker who wants to enjoy a great wine
today, and not a decade hence. Few ’62s can be found in Bor-
deaux today, because they have been spoken for by apprecia-
tive wine-drinkers throughout the world.

The orchestration of a great St. Emilion is expressed
here.

CHATEAU COS D’ESTOURNEL .......-- 12.95 139.85
None of this St. Estephe can be found in Bordeaux.
CHATEAU HAUT BRION........----::: 29.50 318.60

Great, Great. Down to our last few cases.

Our grandchildren will speak of the 1961 vintage as among the
immortals. Nothing would please us more than to give you 4
greater selection, but alas, we are down to an offering of only
3 wines, and on a trade level, none can be found in Bordeaux.

CHATEAU FOURCAS-HOSTEIN ....---- 6.49 70.10
Attention should be paid here. Here is a superb chateau-
bottled Medoc of the great 1961. The excellence of the

vintage is expressed beautifully—with many good years
ahead.
CHATEAU AUSONE ......-5.- (224+ 27.50 297.00

A great St. Emilion. Irreplaceable.

CHATEAU LAFITE ROTHSCHILD.....-- 95.00 1026.00
Is a great work of art worth an astronomic sum? Is this
staggeringly great Lafite Rothschild worth over $1,000.00
the case? The answer is personal—each wine enthusiast
must make his own decision.
