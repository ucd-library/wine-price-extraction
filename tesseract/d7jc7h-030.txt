One of the noblest of the worlds great wines is un- 1914 8.7)
doubtedly an authentic vintage port that has achieved 9S Sto
its maturation, like fine still wine, in bottle rather than 1916 es
cask. Here is the greatest collection in the world — 1917 7.50
moved to our cellars in New York, bottle by bottle,
from the private port museum that Richard Hooper & 1918 7.0
Sons have maintained in their country house for almost 1919 6.72
a century. Honored guests at their home were asked the 1920 6./9
date of their birth or anniversary and a vintage portof [192] a
that year was served. 1922 6.75
In a small personal way, you can follow the same 1923 6.75
thoughtful practice. We suggest sending, as an imagina- 1924 ( : é
tive birthday or anniversary gift, authentic vintage port - Sd
proudly bearing on its label ‘THE YEAR.’ And do not lis PA D,95
overlook the possibilities of sending as the most indi- 1928 5 05
vidual of Chrismas gifts, a bottle of port that bears the 1999 5.95
year of his birth, anniversary, or any other special event. 1931 550
If you have not yet experienced the vinous joy of me
