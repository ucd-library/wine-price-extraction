THE MOST REMARKABLE CHAMPAGNE
OPPORTUNITY OF THE SEASON!

Here are the most treasured bottles of the world famous Pommery and
Greno cellars—a specially selected cuvee, rich in flavor, beautifully balanced
and completely dry-—a wine that was offered proudly to the guests who
attended the Monaco wedding between Prince Rainier III and Grace Kelly.
Don’t let the low price deceive you—Reserve Rainier easily surpasses
many Champagnes selling at much higher levels—a happy choice for the
imaginative Christmas gift or your own distinctive holiday entertaining.
