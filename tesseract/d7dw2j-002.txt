1975 RED BORDEAUX

Since our first offering of 1975 red Bordeaux
in the Fall of 1976, the word has gotten around
—BUY THE 1975 RED BORDEAUX. While we
won’t claim all the credit for creating this de-
mand, we do feel, and continue to believe, that
keep you well informed and up to date regard-
it is our responsibility as wine merchants to
ing the ever-changing wine scene.

Our associates, Sam Aaron and Michael Aaron,
are now in Bordeaux and they have kept in
touch on a continuous level with the growers,
negociants, vinicultural professors and experts
in this city in southwest France, the wine capi-
tal of the world. They report as follows, “There
were happy smiles on the faces of the vigner-
ons in Bordeaux as they joyously tasted the
fruits of their labor—the great, great 1975 vint-
tage. They were aware that the verdict was in
—1975 vintage is being acknowledged as one
of the great red Bordeaux years of our genera-
tion--in the classic, powerful, long-lived tradi-
tion of 1945, 1961, 1966, and 1970. However,
the ‘smiling faces’ soon became ‘long, sad
ones’ on the nights of March 29th and 30th
(sadly, frost also hit Bordeaux again during
the nights of April 9th and 10th) when frost
and freezing temperature wreaked havoc with
the current 1977 crop.

Gloria and Prieuré reported losses in their
harvest yield up to 70%. Because of the quick-

CHATEAU HAUT BRION byJune6 Juneé

(Graves) (#A-12).......... 199.00 220.00
Here power is combined with elegance. A re-
markable Graves.

CHATEAU LATOUR

(Pauillac) (#A-40)......... 210.00 235.00
Full-bodied, firm, but with exceptional soft-
ness and fruit in 1975. Will live for decades.
CHATEAU CHEVAL BLANG

(St. Emilion) (#A-41)...... 199.00 220.00
As in Petrus, the Merlot grape comes through
and imparts fruit, roundness, and richness.
Here is one of the best Cheval Blancs produced
during our generation.

CHATEAU MOUTON

ROTHSCHILD (Pauillac)

fe ee ars 199.00 220.00
Wine lovers should pause here. Many Bor-
deaux wine experts consider Chateau Mouton
Rothschild 1975 perhaps the best single red
wine produced during this illustrious year. Its
current wholesale price in Bordeaux is close
to $200 the case. We have managed to persuade
the vineyard to part with a reasonable quan-
tity at the early low opening price. We are
passing all of the savings on to you. Now—
while our limited inventory exists—is the time
to acquire the great, great Mouton 1975 at the
wonderfully low price of $199 the case. Also
available in Magnums and Half-Bottles.
CHATEAU LAFITE

ROTHSCHILD (Pauillac)

Pentru ie ence. 218.00 235.00
We have watched the Lafite 1961 climb to
$750 the case and beyond. Lafite 1966 ap-
proaches $400, and Lafite 1970 is about $300.
Since 1975 may surpass some of these as vin-
tage years, what will Lafite 1975 command in
1982?

CHATEAU PETRUS

(Pomerol) (#A-40)......... 238.00 259.00
We sadly report that on March 29th chilling
frosts demolished the 1977 crop at Chateau
Petrus. There will be no 1977 Petrus. This cruel
fact has rather dramatically moved up the cur-
rent quotations on Petrus ’75.

maturing Merlot grape, St. Emilion and Pom-
erol reported even greater diminution in the
‘77 crop. The Bordeaux optimists hope that
nature will prove kind from now henceforth
and the losses will be somewhat compensated
for by perfect weather from now on, so that
1977 will not go down in history as the lowest
yield of our generation.

We are offering our clientele a last oppor-
tunity, which will expire on Monday, June 6th,
to acquire their 1975 great Clarets at the won-
derfully low prices indicated below. On Tues-
day, June 7th, the higher prices will take effect.
Knowledgeable wine merchants (we have
spoken to the leading ones) predict that even
the June prices will go up substantially by
Christmas.

NOW IS THE TIME TO BUY. A check in pay-

ment, including sales tax, must accompany
the order. The First Growths will be delivered
during the Autumn of 1978. The other great
growths listed here will be delivered during
the Spring of 1978.

These prices include delivery, in accordance

with our delivery terms anywhere within New
York State. All prices quoted are for 4/5 quarts
only. Please inquire as to the availability of
any of these wines in the Half-Bottle, Magnum
and Double-Magnum size (most of these are
only available in the 4/5 bottle size).

1975 GREAT GROWTHS

CHATEAU ANGLUDET Now June 7

(Margaux) (#A-43).......... 57.50 62.50
Light, supple, engaging. The proud property of
the Sichel family. Promises a brilliant future.
CHATEAU GRAND PUY

DUCASSE (Pauillac) (*A-45). 59.75 64.75
Distinguished for balance and depth of flavor,
the vineyards are contiguous to Lafite and
Mouton in the north. In a recent tasting de-
voted exclusively to Second Growths, Grand
Puy Ducasse won second place with its ’73,
and first place with its ’74! The total produc-
tion is less than 5,000 cases. At $59.75, now
is the time to acquire this great Bordeaux.

CHATEAU CLINET (Pomerol)

Pa Wien | ait cle. seek « 69.50 74.50
The good Pomerol vineyards, in the tradition
of Petrus, produce very full-bodied wines, of
splendid nose, and with a gleaming dark ruby
color. Only 17 acres and less than 3,000 cases.

CHATEAU DURFORT VIVENS

(Margaux) (#A-47).......... 69.75 74.50
A great Second Growth. In the exalted league
of Leoville Las Cases, Rausan Segla, Pichon
Lalande, Montrose, and Ducru Beaucaillou.
$69.75 makes this thoroughbred a bargain.

CHATEAU GLORIA (St. Julien)

ere ee ee 69.95 78.50
Here we must pause. In our opinion, this is
possibly the best value in our 1975 offering,
because true greatness is combined with the
liveable price of $69.95 the case. It is Chateau
Gloria that was immortalized recently by
Robert Daley in the feature article that ap-
peared in the Sunday New York Times Maga-
zine. The wine that Henri Martin (President of
the Bordeaux Wine Growers Association), pro-
duced at Gloria in 1975 is truly great and will
develop for at least another decade. Because
of world demand, it is possibly the most dif-
ficult of all of the vineyards of the Medoc to
acquire, so we suggest ordering promptly.
CHATEAU PRIEURE-LICHINE

(Margaux) (#A=55)0 02. .....-. 74.50 79.50
Alexis Lichine, the proprietor, has devoted the
last twenty years to regroup and reconstitute
the vineyards on the best hilly ground of the
Margaux-Cantenac area. By acquiring some of
the best land of the area, the dedicated wine-
wise Lichine has created a wine well above its
Fourth Growth classication.

1975 GREAT GROWTHS (Contd)

CHATEAU L’ANGELUS Now June 7

(St. Emilion) (#A-5)......... 76.00 79.50
The great French restaurants of Paris and New
York clamor for L’Angelus because of its soft-
ness, fruitiness and deliciousness. We were
lucky to get it at all.

CHATEAU TALBOT (St. Julien)

(OBNAR i iscsi cade Tee a 82.50 89.50
Largest vineyard in St. Julien; a model in
equipment and skilled vinification. Very sturdy
and full-bodied for a St. Julien. Deep-colored
and slow to mature. Long-lived.

CHATEAU BRANE CANTENAG

(Margaux)? A-3). 5. 82.50 89.50
Big, dependable. We prefer Chateau Prieuré-
Lichine from the Margaux area.

CHATEAU DUHART MILON

ROTHSCHILD (#A-15)...... 82.50 89.50
Adjacent to Chateau Lafite, sharing the same
proprietor, Baron Elie de Rothschild. Elegance
and depth are beautifully harmonized.

CHATEAU COS d’ESTOURNEL

(St. Estephe) (#A-65)......... 82.50 89.50
A Second Growth that is now approaching
First Growth status. Only a narrow tidal
stream separate the vines of Chateau Lafite
Rothschild from those of Cos d’Estournel. Full
and sturdy, yet soft and fine. In 1975, it is con-
sidered the best of the holy St. Estephe trio
which consists of Montrose, Calon Segur and
Cos d’Estournel. Very, very long-lived. Half-
Bottles and Magnums at $3.00 the case addi-
tional.

CHATEAU PICHON LALANDE a.

(Pauling) 474-57)... 84.50 94.75
Great fullness and finesse. Lies direct’’ adja-
cent to Chateau Latour—the two wines have
similar characteristics.

CHATEAU GRUAUD

LAROSE (St. Julien) (*A-42). . 84.50 94.75
Enjoys the high rank of Second Classified
Growth just below Latour, Mouton, Lafite and
Margaux. Remarkable finesse; beautifully per-
fumed bouquet; will develop gracefully.

CHATEAU DUCRU

BEAUCAILLOU (St. Julien)

age i eee rete 2 eee: 89.50 99.50
Wonderful name—means ‘beautiful pebbles.’ It
is this gravelly soil that produces elegant,
flowery, full-bodied wines such as this.

CHATEAU FIGEAC (St. Emilion)

oe ee ee 89.50 99.50
If you like Chateau Cheval Blanc, and are not
prepared to pay $195.00 the case, Chateau
Figeac would be the ideal alternative. Why?
The vineyard is adjacent to Cheval Blanc and
produces a glorious wine that is quite its
equal in depth, distinction, and longevity.
CHATEAU LYNCH BAGES

(Pauillac) [2A-25). = 2... 89.50 99.50
Rich, full-almost achieves the depth, richness
and weight of its neighbor Mouton Rothschild.
A wine designed for those who like power.

CHATEAU TROTANOY

(Pomerol). (7 A-39).. .... 5-05. a: 108.75... 119.75
Less than 3,000 cases of this great Pomerol are
produced a year. A true glory—in the grand
tradition of Chateau Petrus which means it is
mouth-filling, big, vigorous, and dramatic.
CHATEAU LA MISSION HAUT

BRION '(°A-29) oo 134.50 142.75
Distinguishing characteristics are balance and
finesse. This 1975 will continue to grow for
another two decades.
