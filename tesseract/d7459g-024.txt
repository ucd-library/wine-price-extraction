Gentlemen
Two years have elapsed since we have bottled our outstanding 1954 red Burgundies. Our pre-
dictions have been more than fulfilled -- well balanced wines, superior bouquet, fine
more color, excellent body, penetrating charm of flavor, all of which gives assurance of
present excellence and a remarkably long life ahead.
F
: At the Domaine, we delayed making our vintage in 1954, in the hope of better weather over
the weeks ahead -- risking all in case of a severe frost. We were rewarded by nearly a
: month of beautiful warm sunshine, combined with just enough moisture, to produce fine,
x
. ripe grapes, which have developed into perfectly splendid wines that cannot fail to add
lustre to the dignity and repute of the Domaine.
