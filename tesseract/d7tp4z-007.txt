proud wine villages in Beaujolais and { OS

Pouilly have made a most important

discovery. Their beloved wines are con-
sumed so enthusiastically by thirsty ‘ 0) ) "

Frenchman that a half bottle is never

  
  
  
  
  
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
  
    
   

quite enough and a full bottle usually
too much. So they have devised a grace-
ful, “in-between” bottle fondly called

“Pot” which we present in the GREAT

1959 VINTAGE.
The vraceful ‘‘in-between =!
bottle” holding a generous 17
f ounces — not as large as the
regular bottle, but almost 50%

larger than the half bottle.

“Here are some of the most deligh tful, fruity and full wines
from the Beaujolais and Pouilly Fuisse districts that I have
ever tasted—the whites have an unequalled fruitiness,
mouth filling fullness and balance—the red have great fi-
nesse, good color, and perfume of the fruit—1959s that are
delightful now and yet have a good future”, states Alexis
Lachine, internationally famous wine authority and the man
who selected these wines after many days of tasting at the
vineyard.
