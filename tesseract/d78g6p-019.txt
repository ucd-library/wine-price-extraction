For more than two centuries the Counts von Kesselstatt have acquired some of the best
vineyard land along the Moselle. Their properties include the famed Josephshof in the
village of Graach and a choice section of the Piesporter Goldtropfchen.

At annual competitions held throughout Germany, von Kesselstatt wines have won count-
less gold awards. Their excellent Josephshofer is often compared to the king of the
Moselle, Bernkasteler Doktor.

The harmony of fruit and dryness and the haunting captivating bouquet of a great Moselle
is an experience no wine lover should miss. While our limited supply lasts we can offer
these exceptional wines at only $3.99 the bottle, $47.88 the case. The Josephshofer,
for one, typically commands $10.00 the bottle.
