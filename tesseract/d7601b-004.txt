Like Boswell and like golf, this whisky is unequivocally Scottish. Light in body, very pale in color—even
Mr. Boswell would have approved.

Villiam It is no accident that this superb Scotch whisky from the venerable cellars of Fortnum & Mason enjoys such
proud great vogue in London. Comparative tasting clearly demonstrates that this whisky has the distinction and

 

balance that can only be achieved through long maturation of fine spirits. Comparable in pedigree and taste
to Secotches selling above $7.00.
