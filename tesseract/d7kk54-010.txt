OLDER RED BORDEAUX

Older vintages of red Bordeaux are fast disappearing from the market --
and inventories held by Bordeaux negociants and American importers have
dwindled to almost nothing. We are fortunate to have a few exceptional
wines still in stock, and we have listed our favorites below. Each is a

 

  
 

classic -- the sort of wine one remembers fondly after enjoying its pleasures.

 

1970 Bordeaux
at Liweable Price?

 

 

Round, flavoriul, perfectly mature -- the 77

ideal claret for drinking over the coming a .
Winter season. Although Chateau La Croix Chateau la Croix
bears the simple appellation "Bordeaux BORDEAUX SUPERIEUR
Superieur," the wine inside the bottle —— SU
performs well in blind tastings among C

several well-known Haut Medocs. Or

As the great 1970 vintage has all but MIS EN BOUTEILLE AU CHATEAU
disappeared from the marketplace, and ———eS
most prices are extraordinarily high, this ae eC
delightful Bordeaux is something of an

economic miracle. (#371) $5.49 bottle, $59.50 case

No. Bottle Case

 

643 CHATEAU TALBOT 10967 (St. Julten) 16.95 195.

A major success in a most attractive vintage.
Perfect drinkability now -- and over the next
few years.

daz CHATEAU GRUAUD LAROSE 17.95 206.02
1970 (St. Julien)
Intense color and flavor
mark this impressive claret.
One of the best Gruaud Laroses
of our generation -- which is a
major accomplishment indeed!

606 CHATEAU CLINET 1966 (Pomerol) 20: 95 299.00

A tiny estate -—- just seventeen see n producing
one of Pomerol's most elegant wines. Magnificent in the
hard-to-come-by '66 vintage.

1001 CARRUADES DE LAFITE-ROTHSCHILD (Pauillac) 37.49 428.00

Carruades '66, a great vintage, is truly a collector's
item demonstrating the magnificence of a fully- matured &$SS5
wine grown and bottled at Lafite-Rothschild. Drinking it 7
fourteen years after the vintage is truly a noble experience.
