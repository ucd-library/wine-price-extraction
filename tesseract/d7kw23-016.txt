RT. HON. ERNEST MARPLES PROVIDES
THE BEST OF BEAUJOLAIS — MAKING
POSSIBLE THIS DRAMATIC OFFERING

**1966 BEAUJOLAIS of dis-
tinction and longevity’’—all
from the best vineyards of
Moulin-a-Vent, Brouilly,
Chenas and Viré—James
Beard states—“‘a high point
in fruity Beaujolais and a
low point in cost has been
achieved here.”’

The career of the Rt. Hon. Ernest Marples
is not unfamiliar to American readers who
follow British politics—and now his name
is an affectionate expression among dis-

criminating wine drinkers in the United
States.

Many of us are aware that Ernest Marples
was a favored disciple of Winston
Churchill ever since 1945. Some of us have
travelled the highways he constructed in
Britain, particularly the one from the air-
port to London. We have watched him as
a Cabinet Minister when he was, Post-
master-General, and later as Minister of
‘Transport won acclaim as the man who
“made London traffic work.”’ And even to-
day, he is an active member of Parliament
and is regarded as one of Europe’s most
skilled mountain climbers.

Why would such a man dedicate so much
of his energy to growing and caring for
wine? We have spent many days with Ruth
and Ernest Marples in their vineyards and

in their London kitchen where Ruth cre-
ates remarkable food—and now we under-
stand why. Let us call it a love affair. Both
Ruth and Ernest love the countryside be-
tween Macon and Lyon, have walked the
hills, have learned to know intimately the
vignerons, and they knew that some day
they would own vineyard land and main-
tain the highest standards of the Macon-
nais and Beaujolais. They acquired their
first property a decade ago in Fleurie, and
subsequently acquired the historically fa-
mous Chateau Chaintre.

Mr. Marples is not a man to readily com-
promise whether it be politics, industry or
wine. The four gems from this area shown
below reflect his dedication to excellence
and will surely provide much pleasure to
your dinner table, whether it be this sum-
mer or next winter.

The prices at which we offer all these wines
are not simply low but fantastically so. You
must remember that they were available
in New York a year ago for $3.00 a bottle
and everyone sang their praises—while this
shipment remains, you can avail yourself
of the unique opportunity of acquiring
any one of the four wines—three are red
and one is white—at only $1.79 the bottle,
$19.95 the case.

 

 

  
  
  
     
  
  
   
  
  
  
  
 

 

 

The four wines representing the best soil
of the Beaujolais area, all of the
1966 vintage are pictured here.

Because of hail and excessive rain
during 1967 and 1968 the price for the
outstanding 1966 is now astronomically
high. For example, a Moulin-a-Vent
commands over $20.00 a case

at the vineyard today.
