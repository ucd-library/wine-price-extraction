30 years, Sam Aaron and his associates,
Joseph Stricks and Michael Aaron, is bound
to be a learned and discriminating oenophile.
Why? Because Sherry-Lehmann is not mere-
ly a store located at 679 Madison Avenue, it
is a kind of school, an academy presided
over by a benignant faculty of instructors,
and boasting an extensive library of
thousands of life-giving classics, bound

in glass and interestingly titled.

| have attended this school ever since it
first opened its doors in 1934. Sam and Joe
and their erudite colleagues

have, for over a quarter of a century,

been teaching me about wine — and there-
fore about life, of which wine, if properly
understood, should form a considerable
part. It is a fortunate thing for me that

at this happy season the issuance of this
super-catalog gives me the chance to
thank them, in print, for what, as wine
merchants and friends, they have done

for me.

For, make no mistake, a wine merchant,

if he be a good one, is in a class by him-
self. He does not deal in glittering gee-
gaws like a fashionable jeweler, or in

mere dull necessities, like a grocer.

He deals, like Plato, in essences. He

sells you, not an object, but a mysterious
substance, akin to an idea, which has the
power to enhance your life, however
slightly. His responsibility to his clients,
his students, is a grave one, indeed a truly
professional one. And, when he is a

Sam Aaron or a doe Stricks, he bears that
responsibility quietly and nobly.

To my good friends at 679 Madison Avenue,
and to all wine-drinkers everywhere — a
superb bottle and a toast to a joyous Fall
and Holiday season!
