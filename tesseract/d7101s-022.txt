1973 VINTAGE

The record-breaking yield meant some wines could be too light,
too thin. Others that were caref] not

to Overproduce are

glorious. Only after much vigorous tasting did we decide upon
those listed here, all with their ful] quota of body and fruit.

No.

PINOT CHARDONNAY «.........°..... 2.49 29.88
Delicious, simple, this wine easily triumphed in all our
blind tastings of inexpensive white Burgundies. Charles
Meras.
BOURGOGNE BLANC .................. 2.99 35.88
Charles Quillardet estate-bottled this wonderful wine.
A delight for making ‘Kir.’
PAY VON Chucho a 2.99 35.88
Excellent fruit and distinction for such low-cost. One of
our personal favorites for lunch, supper or apéritifs.
Charles Meras.
POU PUINSR es 3.99 47.88
Pouilly-Fuissés have become too expensive in recent
years. We gladly reverse the trend with a top-flight
example from Charles Meras.
CHABLIS, LES: CLOS. =)... a 5.79 69.48
A celebrated Grand Cru endowed with much fragrance
and character. Estate-bottled, Robin.
CHASSAGNE-MONTRACHET,

MORGEOT ...... fica naan NE Gee Cee ae 5.99 71.88
Chassagne can boast not only of Montrachets but of the
always superior whites grown at its less-well-known
vineyards. M. Deliser’s estate-bottling of 1973 Morgeot
represents white Burgundy of tremendous breed and
beauty.

CHEVALIER MONTRACHET............ 12.95 155.40
The few precious acres of Chevalier Montrachet, lying
just behind the Montrachet vineyard in the famed com-
mune of Puligny, produce a rare white wine of utmost
quality. Estate-bottled by Deliser, this is a fabulous
opportunity to taste a remarkable glory at an equally
remarkable low price.

MONTRAGHED 3) oo 17.50 210.00
To say that Montrachet has a tremendous bouquet, an
enveloping richness and astounding depth only hints at
the experience. M. Milan, the grower of our selection,
produced in 1973 a wine more than worthy of the name.

1972 VINTAGE

Fine wines, especially from the Céte de Beaune, with sufficient
acidity to a fresh, long life. Less successful in Chablis.

31, ROMAIN BLANG. =... 2... 2.99 34.75
: Roland Thévenin, proprietor of
some of Burgundy’s greatest
vineyards, makes his home in
the peaceful village of St. Ro-
main in the hills behind Meur-
sault. He sends us what we
think is a real discovery—light,
dry, round and fruity, an ideal
expression of the blessings of Bourgogne blanc.
POUUILY-LOCHE 3. co ee 2.99 35.88
If you find everything about Pouilly-Fuissé charming ex-
cept its price, try this noteworthy wine from a neighbor-
ing village. Ample fruit, good balance. A best buy from
Caron.
AUXEY-DURESSES BLANC ............. 3.99 47.88
Similar to a fine Meursault, but at considerable savings.
Estate-bottled by René Roy.
MEURSAULT, NARVAUX ............... 5.49 65.88
No wine from this famed town strikes a more pleasing
harmony of depth and freshness than Michelot’s 1972
estate-bottling of the wine from the fine Narvaux vine-
yard.
CHASSAGNE-MONTRACHET,

RUCHOTIES (3) oes oe a 6.99 83.88
An elegant, complex white wine from the estate of
Claude Ramonet, among the most esteemed growers on
the Céte de Beaune.

CORTON-CHARLEMAGNE ............. 14.95 161.45
Perhaps the goal to which all other white Burgundies of
this vintage must aspire. Profund flavor wrapped in a
golden robe. Estate-bottled by Delarche.

TWO SPECIAL
WHITE BURGUNDIES

Bottle Case
POUILLY-FUISSE 1971 .................. 3.99 47.88
When our favorite Caves Coopérative in Macon comes to
us with 50 cases of the same wine that was our best-
seller two years ago, what do we do? Why, we jump at
the chance to bring our clientéle this vibrant, graceful
pleasure. A joy from the already legendary 1971 harvest.
MEURSAULT, CASSE-TETE 1970........ 5.99 71.88
As we sit writing this catalogue, our task is enriched by
a glass of this very wine. When first we tasted this estate-
bottling by Roland Thévenin, the wine amazed us with
its wonderful bouquet and sublime flavor. At each of our
samplings since, including now, it shines. One of the best
mature white Burgundies in our recent memory.

COTES DU RHONE ROUGE 1974......... 2.29 25.95
The happy choice of some of
our most discriminating cli-
entele for their light and re-
freshing everyday red wine.
Unlike lesser representa-
tives of this popular appel-
lation, the wines of La Vieille
Ferme contain much Petit
| Sirah —the grape that gives
Chateauneuf-du-Pape its in-
imitable character. The wonderfully low price makes this
delightful bottle far and away the best red wine value in
New York. La Vieille Ferme.
Seve ROSE 1972 7. 2.49 29.88
This delightful pink wine of Tavel is acclaimed every-
where as the best vin rose produced on the globe. Dra-
matic best buy. Bellicard.

CROZES HERMITAGE ROUGE 1972..... 3.49 41.88
Nearly as good as Hermitage itself and a fraction of the
price. Just coming into its own. Chapoutier.

CROZES HERMITAGE BLANC 1972...... 3.49 41.88
The hot sun and rocky terrain give white wines from the
Rhone an intriguing deep character. You will love this
elegant example from M. Chapoutier as we do.

CHATEAUNEUF-DU-PAPE 1973 ......... 3.99 47.88
Alexis Lichine discovered the Chateauneuf of Dr. Nalys
on one of his wine tasting trips through the Rhéne Valley.
We share his unbounded enthusiasm for this rich and
robust Rhone red. Domaine de Nalys.

HERMITAGE ROUGE 1971 .............. 5.49 65.88
Considered the best single red wine produced in the
Rhone Valley. Still young, the wine is already rich and
pleasing but it will improve immensely in the years
ahead. Chapoutier.
