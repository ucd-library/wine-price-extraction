HISTORIC MADEIRA

Is a Collector’s Item

By Clementine Paddleford

When the great dinner is
done, the hearth fire a smol-
dering. heap: Of sold. and
guests are gathered ’round,
bring in the Madeira, one
dating back to Colonial times.
Let it be a bottle of the year
1805 which has survived from
the day of Thomas Jefferson,
surely a collector’s item. One
better, «a 1/92. Vadeira. Hu-—
rope’s: oldest: and most’ re-
markable wine which was
laid down when George
Washington was President.

There are precious few
such bottles left in the world
today. A few hundred, that’s
all. And Sherry Wine & Spir-
its has cornered the lot. When
these are gone the opportu-
nity to taste authentic nine-
teenth-century vintage Ma-
deira of this calibre will be
lost forever. These are wines
to serve as one would an old
and strong-hearted Cognac.
These are wines to appraise
Sip DY ‘Sip 4s sift from the
gods. Walnuts the only ac-
companiment. The back-
ground story of the wine
makes for long and pleasant
talk, adding historic interest
to the holiday dinner.

Madeira History

It was two years ago Sam
Aaron, of Sherry Wine &
Spirits, went sight seeing to
Mount Vernon. His great in-
terest in the trip was the dis-
covery that Madeira had been
the chief wine in Mr. Wash-
ington’s cellar. Knowing Ma-
deira is of long life, it seemed
possible that there might still
be available vintages of the
Colonial period. Research on
Madeira’s early history re-
vealed that during the Colo-
nial days the sailing vessels
of the British which con-
trolled the seas made a regu-
lar stop at Madeira, the island
600 miles southwest of Lisbon
near the African coast. There
the vessels took on casks of
wine for consumption on the
long round-trip voyages to
America and the East Indies.

In those days before the
science of canning and bot-
ling fruits and vegetables
had been perfected scurvy
was the dreaded disease and
Madeira wine, it was believed,
was one effective preventa-
tive. Moreover, Charles II had
passed a law prohibiting the
import into the Colonies :of
all commodities save those

loaded in English ships in
English ports, with one ex-
ception the wines of Madeira
and the Azores. This resulted
in the rapid development of
the vineyards.

Madeira became the elite
wine served in the fine draw-
ing rooms of Boston, Wash-
ington, Philadelphia. It was
a wine esteemed on the tables
of the great plantations of
the South. It was judged the
best in the homes of the pros-
perous merchants and ship
owners of the North. The
very word Madeira meant
gracious living.

Whims of Fashion

Checking with the oldest
handlers of the Island’s wines
it was found that the J- D,
Blandy firm still held Ma-
deira stocks predating 1873.
That was the fatal year the
Island’s vineyards were dev-
astated by Phylloxera. Wine
making came to a sudden
halt. A solution was found
eventually by the introduc-
tion of American vines which
were virtually immune to this
sucking insect. These were
used as root stock to which

the more delicately flavored

Island varieties were grafted.
Good wine was made again.
But after the Phylloxera in-
vasion there was a_ great
shortage of the fine Madeiras
and many gave up this wine

and many forgot all about it.
Fickle fashion turned her
back on the wine of Colonial
days and Madeira went into
eclipse.

The Blandy house had the
foresight and courage to keep
building its stocks even dur-
ing the 1870’s, the trouble
years. Comes the appointed
hour for Madeira’s return.
The Island in recent years
is a popular stop for pleasure
cruises. Her wines are grow-
ing ih favor: dsarge stocks
have accumulated and ma-
tured. Fashion again gives
Madeira the nod.

The Sherry Wine & Spirits
Co., after much correspond-
ence with Blandy, purchased
a few bottles of their oldest
vintages to sample for color,
bouquet and vigor. The result
is that Sherry Wine & Spirits
has reserved all of the Blandy
oldest stocks for a period of
two years. Twelve of the sev-
enteen wines now offered are
made especially from grapes
that pre-date the Phylloxera
scourge. Each bottle label is
individually numbered and
states the total number of
bottles in existence. The back
label gives the personal his-
tory of the wine and is hand
signed by a director of the
firm of Blandy, certifying
that the bottle contains a
genuine Madeira of the vin-
tage stated.
