CHATEAU ROUSSET
(Cotes de Bourg)

ogee WARS We quote our own ad in the New

JATEA York Times: "Remember when it
RO eopy was possible to buy top-flight
eee red Bordeaux at prices so afforda-
ble that you could drink well
everyday? Those days are back!

CH

|__ CHATEAU ROUSSET is the kind

- of wine that knowledgeable,
cost-conscious wine drinkers in Bordeaux consume daily at
at their tables, while saving their Lafites and Haut Brions
for special occasions. Until recently, this has been a well-
kept secret of the Bordelais. But now the secret is out--
and the great bargains from the Bourg have reached England,
Belgium, Switzerland--and the United States, too."

CHATEAU HAUT BEYCHEVELLE GLORIA (St. Julien)
At Chateau Gloria they follow the practice of using
three different labels for their products. The labels

are 'Gloria,’ 'Haut-Beychevelle Gloria’ and
‘Peymartin.’ All are superb, and blind tasting

after blind tasting, the experts we assembled could
not differentiate among them. If you like Chateau
Gloria 1973 at $8.00 the bottle, you will simply
adore Chateau Haut Beychevelle Gloria at $5.49
the bottle.
