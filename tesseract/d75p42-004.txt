We quote from the book “Madeira” written by André Simon,  $ yj.i4 ws sols
founder of the Wine & Food Society and one of the world’s 700 3
leading gastronomic authorities. “In January 1933, Dr. Michael deities Mies E
Grabham, ‘the grand old man’ of Madeira, celebrated his Ss
ninety-third birthday, which was the occasion on which I tasted Bottled 8% Shipped by —
for the first time an authentic 1792 Madeira, perfect as regards Justina Henriques a, L
colour, bouquet and flavor.” On that occasion the good Dr. oo wachal one 4
Grabham stated “This wine was made in 1792, a very good year Hise Ee
indeed—it was given to me in 1873. It has been with me during
the past 60 years. There is very little left, and it is better toda 75 pa}

The wine we are presenting here is even older—it is of a year $340
when Marie Antoinette was not yet born—it is of the 1748 The C
Vintage Solera. It is of historical interest to note that the London c wase
Daily Telegraph of October 8th, 1841 refers to vintages such as 1792 and 1748 as having been a

purchased by Napoleon in 1815 to comfort him in his exile when his ship stopped at Madeira
on his way further south to St. Helena.

The entire contents of the 1748 cask were recently bottled, interrupting a 220 year slumber.
It consisted only of 700 bottles, some of which has found its way to Sherry's. Our tasting notes
read “amazing vigor, penetrating bouquet, great depth of flavor, relatively dry—rivals old
Cognac in scope aid interest”. :

Because precious few bottles exist in the world, we suggest prompt acquisition—even a
single bottle will add its touch of lustre to the most distinguished cellar, historic interest to
the holiday dinner party, and heartwarming joy as a unique Christmas gift
