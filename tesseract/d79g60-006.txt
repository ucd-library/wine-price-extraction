“The very existence, let alone the sheer perfec-
tion of this 1830, is an historic wine event-—
these 19th Century Madeiras have provided one
of the great wine tasting experiences of my life,”

states James Beard.

We launch the holiday season with a wine event
of significance—an epoch-making offering of the
most remarkable collection of authentic 18th and
19th Century Madeiras ever seen either in conti-

nental Europe or the United States.

Fach of these wines is a collector's item that was
housed in the museum in the cellars of Blandy. On
all seven of the Blandy wines listed here, the front
label, individually numbered, states the total num-
ber of bottles in existence. The back label, which
gives the individual history of each wine, is signed
by a Director of the impeccable firm of Blandy cer-
tifying that the bottle contains a genuine Madeira

of the vintage stated.

The very existence of such splendid examples
of vintage Madeira is chiefly due to the foresight of
Charles Blandy, who, unlike his contemporaries,
built up stocks of fine, ageing Madeira during and
after the time when the island vines were de-

stroyed by the blight.

When these are gone, the opportunity to taste
authentic 19th Century Vintage Madeira and
18th Century Solera Madeira of this calibre will

be lost forever.
