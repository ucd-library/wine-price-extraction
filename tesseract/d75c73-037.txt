time, have been resting in our cellars now for over four years. Suffi-
cient bottle-age has been acquired so that even a modestly qualified
wine lover can appraise the year and recognize its virtues.

It became quite apparent after the 1964s had been tasted—that they
are rich in fruit, well-balanced, enjoyable today and endowed with
sufficient depth and staying power to indicate quite clearly that there
still remains a goodly number of good, glorious and satisfying years
lying ahead. Drink them today—or lay them away for the future,
whichever you do, you will make no mistake.

209 VOLNAY, CLOS CHAMPANS. 4.79 5175

Estate-bottled by Marquis d’Angerville.

We shall never forget our visit to the friendly home of Marquis d’Angerville and
his charming wife. Here is the very wine that was served us at dinner and we
were intrigued by its velvety qualities, superb fruit, and fantastic amount of
finesse.

403 CHAPELLE-CHAMBERTIN. . 5.99 64.70

Estate-bottled, P. Damoy.

In a blind tasting, we put this remarkable wine up against several Chambertins,
and none of the competition surpassed it. A true jewel in the Burgundian crown,
priced at half its true value.

608 VOSNE ROMANEE, LES
MENG... «43. ss OS - 12,90

This velvety, soft Vosne-Romanée, from the outstanding Reignots vineyards, is
grown and estate-bottled by the Domaine de la Romanée — the proprietor of
the tiny, but world-renowned ‘“‘La Romanée.”’ Worth over $10.

199 CORTON BRESSANDES .. . 7.39 79.80

Estate-bottled, Prince de Merode.
A remarkable example of the heights that can be achieved by a dedicated grower
at this outstanding vineyard.

dis (EOS DE VOUGEOT . . => . 7.39 79.80

Estate-bottled by R. Engel.

Because of the size of Clos Vougeot — the targest vineyard in Burgundy — it
is important that the wine come from a choice section and is produced by an
impeccable grower. Here is an example of Clos Vougeot at its best.

829 CHAMBERTIN, CLOS DE BEZE 9.25 99.90

Estate-bottled, P. Damoy.

In A.D. 630, the Duke of Burgundy founded the Abbey of Beze. The monks
cleared the land and planted vines on the choicest 37 acres. Its reputation for
excellence now extends over fourteen centuries. It is not as well known as
‘Chambertin’ itself, but it is generally recognized as being at least its equal.

798 VOSNE-ROMANEE,
LA GRANDE RUE... « . 9.95 107.45

Estate-bottled, H. Lamarche.
If there is a better red wine produced in Burgundy, it surely would be hard to
identify or find. Truly great — at least a decade of glory ahead.

505 LA ROMANEE.. =. . « « 4450 156.60

Estate-bottled, Domaine de la Romanée.

The 2.1 acre of La Romanée is separated from Romanée-Conti by a narrow foot
path. Despite the proximity, the qualities are individual and distinct. La
Romanée is a bit more robust, but what it gains in body, is relinquished in
finesse.

TOTO AIUSIGNY (4 75. a es 20 90

Estate-bottled by Comte de Vogue.

On one side of the slope the land is worthless — on the other side there is the
16 acre Musigny vineyard which brings prices of over $30,000.00 the acre.
Poverty and wealth exist side by side, not only in cities, but also in vineyard
land. None of this wine exists in the cellars, or in the hands of the importers —
only 12 cases remain and we are probably the largest holders of this 1964 in the
world.

So. tA PACHE 5 «4. 2. . TEs 189.00

Estate-bottled, Domaine de la Romanée-Conti.

Only 15 precious acres! Many consider this the greatest single red wine produced
in France, and we are the last to argue the point. Very rare, irreplacable. Buy
now — or “forever hold your peace,”’ for soon ’64 La Tache will be but a fond
memory.

 

 

We quote from a letter received from Comte de Villaine, the pro-
prietor of the Domaine de la Romanee-Conti, “Weather can be a
slave or a master. We prefer that it be a slave. Though ovr neizh-
bors did not fair so well during the 1963 vintage, we sprayed our
vines fourteen times — though expensive, it prevented the damp
weather from taking over and reducing our quality. We advised our
pickers — “gather only the better grapes — forget the rest.” We
took the risk in October 1963 — unlike our neighbors, we decided to
wait, taking the gamble of losing the entire crop. Luck was with us
—the sun shone during mid-October, and we started to pick on
October 20th, when the grapes were ripe and healthy, rich with the
sun’s warmth. In my opinion, these 1963s perfectly express our wine.
They are a bit on the light side, but they are the kind of wines you
drink joyously because they give pleasure today — with the added
assurance that they will develop well for at least the next five years
— and probably much longer.”

We need merely invite you to pull the cork from a bottle of La
Tache 1963 and experience one of the most remarkable Burgundies
you have ever encountered. We happily report that the prices are
about half of the 1964 vintage, and for present drinking, we think
they show better than their more expensive successor. Even these
1963s will shortly join the ranks of the unaccessible because none
remains at the vineyard, and no supply exists anywhere which we
can tap to replace our limited inventory.
