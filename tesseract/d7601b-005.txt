 

During this sale period, we offer the classic Chateau bottled wines

 
 

of the great 1959 vintage; the light, excellent 1960's, ready for

 
 

present drinking, and some of the older vintages. On these pages

 
 

can be found some of the greatest Bordeaux opportunities that

 
 

have been presented to the New York public in many years.

 
  
     
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
 
   
   
  
   
  
  
   
   
  

   

Despite the ever increasing replacement costs in Bordeaux, our

large scale purchases have enabled us to roll back the prices. % AVE
