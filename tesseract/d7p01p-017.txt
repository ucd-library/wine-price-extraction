ORY & PALE SHER oLoROs0 SHER eee Wil The name of Wisdom & Warter, now over a
2 ? | century old, has long been respected for the mag-

nificent quality of their Sherries within Spain

and throughout the world. Here is a unique oppor-

tunity to acquire some of Spain’s finest Sherries

at dramatically low cost.

WISDOM’S SHERRIES SALE PRICE

No. Bottle Case

Sl WISDOWWS FINO PAIMA...... . =... 12.59. :17.95

A magnificent example of bone dry, pale, straw colored Sherry. This classic “Fino Palma” has helped Wisdom &
Warter achieve its great international reputation, now a century old. An ideal aperitif when served slightly chilled.
The equal of many Finos that command $3.00 or more the bottle.

S2 WISDOM’S ROYAL BROWN OLOROSO ... 4.79 19.95

There are few wines produced in the world that quite achieve the rich, deep flavor, or dark color depth of a fine
Brown Sherry. Here is a typical, fully aged example. Highly recommended between meals with fruit, nuts or
cake, or as an after-dinner dessert wine.

$3 WISDOM’S AMONTILLADO FINO... .. 41.99 22.65

As this name implies, a good Amontillado belongs to the Fino family, but they acquire certain different character-
istics as they mature; the color becomes more amber-like. As in the Finos, they are very dry, more nutty in flavor
and develop greater body. Here is a perfect example of fine Amontillado that normally commands well over $3.00
the bottle.

WISDOM’S GOLDEN CREAM. .... .. 2.49 27.95

Generally speaking, a top-flight Cream Sherry such as this is the oldest and most luxurious of the wines found in
the Bodegas of Jerez. Usually, a fine Cream Sherry of a reputable firm commands $5.00 or more the bottle. It is
no ordinary event to obtain this medium dry, dramatically rich, wine for only $2.49. We urge that you try it.

in this entire group that is not outstanding.
