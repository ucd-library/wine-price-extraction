bounteously grow upon the mountainous terrain of the Savoie

Deliciously light... glorious fraises des Bois
and like the fable of the Three Bears.

“Greatest contribution to hot weather comfort since the invention
of the revolving fan and the Swinging hammock,” coolly states
Nigel Peaseworthy, Retired Colonel, British Army.

“The ancient city of Chambéry has been making the best
vermouth of Europe since 1854. We proudly offer
‘Chambraise’ as the most significant contribution to
international harmony since the birth of the United
Nations,” states Marcel Deschamps, first citizen of
Chambéry.

“Tasted the ‘Strawberry Blonde’; 2 parts of
‘Chambraise’, one part of vodka, stirred with
ice, a twist of lemon peel added — the ideal
alternative for those who lack air-
conditioning,” states Anthony Roberts,
co-starring with Woody Allen in the
Broadway hit, “Play it Again, Sam.”

“Saran Wrap was a good thing, the
supersonic airplane promises to be
even better — but I think in the
next century, the unique quali-
ties of Chambraise will be
given their just due,” boldly
states Malcolm Hoffman,
co-author with Morris

L. Ernst of “Back & J
Forth.” |
