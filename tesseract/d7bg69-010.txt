CHATEAU MARGAUX 1947 (Margaux)

If one were to choose the greatest postwar Claret, Chateau Margaux 1947 would
have to be considered a leading contestant. Not commercially available for years, it
has rested, untouched, in the cellars of Chateau Margaux since its bottling in 1949
until this year when it was shipped to New York. It is here in all its glory to add its
perfection to any wine collection.

Among the other great post-war clarets Chateau Haut Brion 1945 deserves the most
serious consideration. A fabulous wine—outstanding today and yet will probably
outlive all of them.
