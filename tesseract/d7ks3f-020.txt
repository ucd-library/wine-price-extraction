#260—BAHANS HAUT-BRION

At Chateau Haut-Brion, they follow the
practice of blending a light year such as
1963 with a fuller year such as 1962. When
this happens, it bears the name “Bahans,”
but the noble soil and care of the great
Chateau Haut-Brion are reflected. Superb—
ready now.

The good firm of NICOLAS went into the
vineyards early and bought this typical,
truly fine Chablis below the market price.

The gourmets, tourists and sailors in Nantes
insist on the dry, delicate, white ‘Gros Plant’
as the perfect accompaniment to their
oysters, oursins, and other fruits de mer.
Similar to a fine Muscadet.

choice for day in and day out drinking.
