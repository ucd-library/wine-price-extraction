SWISS VIN ROSE...1964 Vintage
896 ROSE DE GAMAY, ROUSSARD 2.49 1.99 21.50

The Beaujolais district produces a beautiful pink wine out of the Gamay grape. This pink wine, made of the
same grape, in the mountain air of the Alps, is fresher and crisper than its French counterpart. Available in half
bottles at $1.14 each, $24.50 the case.

540 NEUCHATEL ROSE, Oeil de Perdrix 2.95 2.49 26.90

A pink wine which carries the rather startling name of “Partridge-Eye,” descriptive of the color of pink wines
made from black grapes — rather bronze-like in appearance. Vineyards about fifteen minutes from the French
border.

SWISS RED WINES... 1964 Vintage
780 GAMAY, VIN ROUGE VAUDOIS, Cave de la Céte Morges 2.25 1.89 20.40

Gamay, the grape of Beaujolais, has found a happy home in the Waadt Canton of the Vaud. A fresh, fruity, light

red wine that can hold its own against all but the greatest of the Beaujolais. Available in half bottles at $1.09
each, $23.40 the case.

596 MERLOT DEL TICINO, Cantina Sociale Mendrisio 2.49 1.99 21.50

It is the Merlot grape that gives the softness and grace to the red wines of Bordeaux, where it is only second in
importance to the Cabernet grape. It yields relatively quick maturing wines because of less tannin. It can also be
found in the better districts of Northern Italy, and the Italian-speaking Canton of Ticino, just south of the Alps.
Here is Ticino Red at its best, rather like a good Claret. However, we must wait until October, when the wine will
be in bottle, before we can deliver. An interesting, superior red wine — and a bargain!

550 DOLE DU VALAIS, Kanton Wallis 2.75 2.19 23.65

The famed red wine of Switzerland produced in the high, rocky soil of the Rhéne. In this instance, it is an
intriguing blend of the Gamay and the Pinot Noir grape. Deep colored, long lived. Similar to the good Rhéne Red.
Available in half bottles at $1.24 each, $26.65 the case.

751 DOLE PINOT-NOIR DU VALAIS, Kanton Wallis 2.95 2.49 26.90

The Pinot Noir is a noble grape that gives us the great Red Burgundies, whether it be a classic Chambertin, or
a lowly village wine. Transplanted to the Kanton Wallis, the aristocracy and character of good Red Burgundy are
captured here in an individual Swiss manner. More distinguished than the Dole listed above.

ALSATIAN WINES...
375 COTE DE BERGHEIM EDELZWICKER 1963 1.75 1.49 16.10

The word ‘zwicker’ means a blend; and ‘edelzwicker’ means a blend of superior or noble grape varieties. Here is
the very wine that is appreciated so much and drunk so joyously, in the better inns of Strasbourg. An absolute
delight.

371 RIESLING 1962, Jules Muller 2.10 1.89 20.46

Riesling is one of the two greatest of all white wine grapes and particularly thrives among the steep hills of
Alsace. It is the driest and most subtle of the wines produced in this picturesque area. This barrel, one of the best
in the cellars of Jules Muller, was selected for us by Frank Schoonmaker, after tasting sixteen others that were in
competition. Available in half bottles at $1.09 each, $23.40 the case.

391 GEWURZTRAMINER 1961, Jules Muller 2.95 2.49 26.90

In Alsace, this grape gives a highly special, exceedingly spicy, rather soft white wine. It always commands
the highest price of any wines of this area. Jules Muller was particularly successful in his 1961 vintage. This
relatively slow maturing wine is only beginning to show its class. Available in half bottles — $1.39 each, $29.90
the case.

423 RIESLING 1962, F. Hugel Arrival 2.45 26.47
The grace, fruit, and beautiful balance of this, the noblest Alsatian Riesling we have ever tasted, is quite aston-
ishing. Available in half bottles at $1.44 each, $31.11 the case.

New
277 GEWURZTRAMINER GRAND GRU 1962, F. Hugel Arrival 2.46 29.84

F. Hugel is to Alsace what the Domaine de la Romanee Conti is to Burgundy. He is the acknowledged leader, and
his wines always command the highest prices. Many of you have tasted them in the better restaurants of Paris,
London and New York. Mr. Hugel loves his 1962, and we are inclined to agree. Half bottles at. $1.54 the bottle,

$33.22 the case.

M1 GEWURZTRAMINER BEERENAUSLESE 1961, F. Hugel Rarity 12.50 135.00

Germany created the Volkswagen; France answered with the Peugeot. Germany gave us Brahms; France answered
with Debussy. Germany created the great Beerenauslese white wines; France answered with Hugel Ss Gewurztra-
miner Beerenauslese. Astonishing depth of flavor, has the bouquet of a flower garden, sweet without peng cloy-
ing, a truly amazing wine. Less than 100 cases were produced and the grapes were picked berry by berry at pre-

cisely the right moment of ripeness.
