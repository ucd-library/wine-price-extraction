France Sends us TWO Intriguing Wine Racks —

For Your Own Pleasure or as an Imaginative Gift

THE RT. HON. ERNEST MARPLES
BEAUJOLAIS ASSORTMENT IN WINE RACK

The Rt. Hon. Ernest Marples, M.P. was Minister
of Transport in Britain for many years—it was he
who “made London Traffic work.” As owner of
one of the best vineyards in Beaujolais, he has
learned to know the vignerons and their wines
well. It is he who personally selected the six

wines shown here, arranging to have them
shipped in this practical, lacquer-finished wine
rack that will stand you in good stead long after
its contents have been joyously consumed.

Six discoveries from the Beaujolais area; four reds and
two whites; two bottles of each; all personally selected
by The Rt. Hon. Ernest Marples. All for only $29.50.
