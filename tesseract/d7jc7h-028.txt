— Qn Inspired Wine Idea!

Just as good books demand handsome bookcases, fine
wines equally deserve a proper habitat. Inspired by
this concept, we have created four regional samplers,
each holding impeccable examples of the wine-grow-
ing districts, and all presented to you on a money-
saving level in our handsome, sturdy, and forever

useful wine rack.

These wines will provide opportunities for joyous
comparison whilst the rack (designed by the noted
wine and food authority, James Beard) will remain

 

as a welcome addition to the home. Here, also, is an

SAAR

inspired gift idea that will bring joy to your friends
this coming Christmas or at any other time through-

out the year.
