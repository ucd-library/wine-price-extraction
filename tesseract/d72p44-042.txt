The reindeer is symbolic of
Christmas, but the makers
of this world famous Scotch
Whisky are attempting to
modernize tradition by sug-
gesting that Santa Claus
used a ‘‘White Horse.” Beau-
tifully packaged in a metal
cannister (no extra charge).
WHITE HORSE promises to
gallop off with much of the
Scotch gift business this
year. Drink it for your pleas-
ure—or send it as an effec-
