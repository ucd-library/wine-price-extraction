harvest—many Merlot grapes, un

fortunately, were abandoned on the
vine, but the Cabernet Sauvignon
grapes came in healthy. We scoffed
at the pessimists of June who pre-
dicted a small crop, but even their
dire forecast proved too optimistic.
The quantity that was gathered,
among the great vineyards, was de-
ficient by about 40 to 50% the
smallest crop since the exalted vin-
tage of 1961.

The chateau owners were financially
saddened by their low production,
but they are grateful that the vin-
tage was ‘saved’ and they are proud
of the wines they have produced.
Perhaps not the equal of 1961—or
even 1966—but they do know they
are sitting on truly excellent wines
that will be classic clarets, slow to
develop, and with long-life expect-
ancy—destined to be eventually ap-
preciated by Bordeaux enthusiasts,
perhaps not for its charm, but rather
for classic reserve, wiry stamina and
unquestioned longevity.

The prices proved to be far and
away the highest in history. We
must remember that the vineyards
did not yield much income for their
‘quality-starved’ ’68s. The number
of barrels in the caves in 1969 is not
much more than half a normal crop.
With the world demand constantly
growing, there seems ample eco-
nomic justification for the propri-
etors to demand more money for
their ’69s.

All evidence indicates that 1969, as
of a decade from now, will enjoy an
honored place in the wine cellars of
the claret drinkers of the world.

BORDEAUX, June 16th — There
has been much anticipatory guess-
ing and anxiety among the famed
wine houses of Bordeaux as they
awaited the long delayed opening
price for the recently harvested 1969
vintage gathered at Chateau Lafite-
Rothschild. Historically, Lafite has
always commanded the peak price
among the Bordeaux vineyards and
all the merchants expected that 1969
would be record breaking. However,
few realized quite how high it would
go when it opened this June. All
agreed that the high quality at the
vineyard, the frustratingly low pro-
duction due to the weather, and the

 

conspire to set a new all-time rec-
ord. It finally happened, and the
wine is being rationed among
the traditional buyers of Lafite. ¢
Barring the unforeseen, the , y
probability is that Chateau &/
Lafite-Rothschild will be #
traded at about $250
the case on the world
market during the summer
of 1972, immediately after
the wine has been put in bottle

BEAUJOLAIS
In a certain village of Beaujolais, as
you enter, you will see a sign that
‘lq mendicité est interdite
dans la commune.” Translated, this
reads “begging 1s forbidden in this

seemed dubious that the good citi
zens of this prosperous town ever
needed to beg—but the sign had ev1
dently been there for decades. And
this year, it suddenly becomes rele
vant. 800,000 hectolitres were sold
hefore the crop, and the low vield of
the harvest confounded everyone be
cause only 700,000 were gathered !
The shippers, committed to sell,
learned of the low
vaded the cellars of the growers
cover their advance commitments.
The price went up 30% almost 1m
mediately—and they have now gone
up another 30%. And even now, in
mid-June, wine buyers from every
where can be seen scouring Beaujo
lais, begging in
search of their share of the suddenly
precious red wine of this region

from door-to-door,

The quality of the 1969 Beaujolais
is beyond reproach. The wines have
excellent color and a firmness that
has made them more adaptable to
export. They are entirely typical;
the rich purple-red robe is apparent ;
the fruit is there; you will detect a
full measure of bouquet and no one
in the wine trade questions their
charm and balance.
