COUNTRY WINES

Throughout the year, American tourists happily occupy the
better hotels of Paris and the wonderful inns, relais and
resorts of the French countryside. What do they drink? In
most instances, they will happily imbibe the local wines that
are charming, excellent, and are still obtainable at low cost.
These ‘country wines’ make no pretense to greatness—each
has its own personal message, its own charm, and combines
beautifully with the local food specialties.

The better country wines of France have now reached us and
they can be enjoyed in America today at delightfully low cost.
You need merely look at the list below for convincing evidence.
