Hotel De La Poste, Beaune

Marc Chevillot, Proprietor

Those who follow the wine
trail consider a pilgrim-
mage to Burgundy not com-
pleted unless they relax
and dine at the historic
Hotel de la Poste that over-
looks the city square and
the 15th Century Hospice de Beaune. It is at this ancient, his-
toric inn that the vignerons of the Cote d’Or gather to discuss
wine, vintages and yield. For decades the gracious host was
Chevillot Pere—now it is the handsome, vital and knowledge-
able Marc Chevillot, the son—a man who enjoys a high reputa-
tion for dedication and devotion to food and wine.

The listings shown below are the same wines that are now
being served at this gastronomic oasis—all were personally
selected at the vineyard by Marc Chevillot. Some of you may
have tasted these wines at Hotel de la Poste during a Burgundy
sojourn—you may have tried to bring them back home with
you—but the cost of the air freight proved to be discouraging.
Now, we happily report you can acquire them quite easily—
right here in New York, and at enticing prices. They are all
here to add their delight to your entertaining.

RED WINES

470 COTES DU RHONE ROUGE 1970.......-- 2.59 27.95
Marc Chevillot often visits his friend, M. Thullier at
Oustau de Baumaniere, not far from Avignon. En route,
he selects his Rhone wines, and here is one he is most
pleased with.

369 AUXEY-DURESSES 1970 .....----+-+-+°° 4.79 51.75
The quaint wine town of Auxey is a 5 minute drive from
Hotel de la Poste. If you are not intimidated by the com-
plex name, and like good red wine, you will enjoy this
one.

468 CHATEAUNEUF-DU-PAPE 1969 ......--- 4.79 51.75
This noble Rhone Valley vineyard is a half day’s drive
south of Beaune.

391 SAVIGNY-LES-BEAUNE 1969 ......----- 5.99 64.70
From Mr. Chevillot’s local area. Light, fresh, soft, de-
lightful.

271 GEVREY-CHAMBERTIN 1966 .....------ 6.99 75.50

Marc Chevillot passes this famed wine commune in his
car almost daily. He knows the growers well. They repay
his friendship by providing him with some of their better

wines.
WHITE WINES
241 BOURGOGNE ALIGOTE 1970 .......---- 2.79 30.15

‘Aligote’ is the second best white wine grape of Bur-
gundy. It is not too well known in America, but is drunk
copiously along the Cote d’Or. Young, fresh, dry.

418 MEURSAWULE 1970 oi oe june wee oo 4.49 48.50
Only ten minute’s drive away from the inn—we can pre-
sume that such friendly intimacy means that ‘Hotel de
la Poste’ surely obtains the choicest examples of the
harvest.

431 POUILLY-FUISSE 1971 ............----- 5.99 64.70
Not inexpensive, but Pouilly-Fuissé at its best. Much
depth and balance, long lived.

373 PULIGNY-MONTRACHET 1971 .......--. 6.99 75.50
From some of the best white wine vineyard land of the

entire Cote d’Or.

SU US eR)

it has been a tradition of both Baron Eli de Rothschild
at Chateau Lafite-Rothschild, and Baron Phillipe de
Rothschild at Chateau Mouton-Rothschild, to bottle a
few cases of each good vintage in impressive large
bottles. We believe the Rothschilds are completely
justified in doing this because the life expectancy of
a wine increases in a larger container, since the air
to wine ratio is reduced. In addition, it provides them
the possibility of serving these glamorous giants at
special dinner occasions, and to honor distinguished
guests.

The heritage of the wines listed below is without flaw.
Both the Lafite-Rothschilds and the Mouton-Roths-
childs have been resting under ideal conditions at the
Chateau until only recently. Their condition repre-
sents sheer perfection. We proudly offer these glitter-
ing jewels to the appreciative wine lover, whether his
purpose be to add their distinction to his own cellar,
or be it to provide him with the most remarkable of
gifts.
