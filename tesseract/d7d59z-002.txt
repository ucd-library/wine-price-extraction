829 CHATEAU MOUTON ROTHSCHILD 1973 (Pauillac) 11.95

We have an intriguing story to tell. We all know that it has been

a practice of Baron Philippe de Rothschild to persuade the world's
greatest artists to creat a label for each of his vintage
years, We have seen the works of Chagall in 1970,
Miro in 1969, Braque in 1965. The only one missing
was Pablo Picasso. World opinion developed quickly
that Baron Philippe was never able to persuade Picasso,
The truth is that Picasso did create a label for the good
Baron but asked that it not be used until after his death,

Picasso died in 1973 - the very year Chateau Mouton
Rothschild was officially declared a First Growth - the
first change in the 1855 classification in over a century.
To commemorate the event, and the memory of Picasso,
Baron Rothschild declared his art the official label for |
the 1973 vintage, a very good year at Mouton Rothschild.

1973

The wine has just arrived. It promises to be a collector's
item - not only for the extraordinary beauty of the label
that Picasso created for this Mouton Rothschild 1973. It
is not an easy wine to come by and the price has mounted

dramatically in Bordeaux. We offer our first shipment at
the opening price of only $11.95 the bottle, $136.25 the case.

It is just coming into its own - especially in the slower-to-mature,
larger magnum size. Here is truly great wine to be served only at
the most important gastronomic event.

CUISINE MINCEUR, written by Michel Guerard, is currently the #1 best seller in the world of food.

CHAMPAGNE CUVEE MICHEL GUERARD BRUT promises to be a best seller in the world of wine.

 

WHY? ‘Michel Guerard) to quote Craig Claiborne, 'is one of the world's greatest chefs.' It is this
handsome, youthful French chef who has created 'la cuisine minceur', or slimming cookery. It was
out of his expertise in catering to the food enthusiasts of the world at Pot au Feu, the spa resort in
ae and at Regine's in Paris and in New York, that his best seller 'Cuisine Minceur'
was born.

Just as Michel Guerard revered lightness,
beauty and flavor in food preparation, he
BRUT sought out the same virtues in French Cham-

CHAMPAGNE pogne. He ultimately found what he was

looking for in the town of Mesnil in the
iche Champagne district, where a superb light,

very dry and elegant Champagne was produced
exclusively from white grapes. Proud of what
he discovered, he had this noble wine bear

 

be available at Regine's in New York, the
Four Seasons, and Windows on the World.

 

We recommend it unreservedly, and candidly, we think it is in league with other Champagnes that

command double the price. Our first shipment will be available for deliver

a y in early March; We
suggest you order it now to make certain that you can experience its bone -dry, Tight spark ing

BEAUNE, HOSPICES DE BEAUNE 1973, Cuvee Betault Tee, PieG
In Burgundy, the most important wine event of the year is. the November
Hospices de Beaune auction. Five hundred barrels go under the hammer
with the proceeds going to charity. One of the best of the '73s is this
soft, fruity and outstanding Beaune.

CLOS DE VOUGEOT 1973, Rameau TiS 91.10
Clos de Vougeot, the largest vineyard of Burgundy, consists of 125 acres

divided among 60 owners. The quality, as a consequence, varies with

the plot and the skill of the winemaker. At its best, it deserves its

status as a great Grand Cru. Here is one of the finest we have ever tasted.

POMMARD EPENOTS 1973, Loubet US eo
Pommard is popular - perhaps because it is easy to pronounce
- but one must be careful. To obtain the best, seek out the
two most exalted vineyards which are 'Epenots' and 'Rugiens.
Also make certain it is estate-bottled. Once acquired, you
will be experiencing a soft, gracious, fruity Burgundy of
superior distinction and breed. This 1973 will absolutely
delight you.
