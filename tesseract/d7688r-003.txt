The Gamay vine is despised in Burgundy, but becomes one of the noblest of plants in the Beaujolais district. Its wines are fresh
and fruity, the pride of gastronomic Lyon, and is at its best when not more than 5 or 6 years old. Here is a particularly noble
one, light and refreshing and of perfect balance.

248 ECHEZEAUX 1949 (Estate Bottled, Thorin-Tastevinage selection) . OO B4A75

A great wine event is the annual tasting of Burgundies held at Clos Vougeot by the Grand Council of the Chevalier du Tastevin.
At this tasting, it is the duty of the council to select the finest wines of Burgundy which thereafter are allowed to bear the label
“Tastevinage”. This noble Red Burgundy from the famed Echezeaux vineyard won high acclaim at this tasting.

301 LA TACHE 1950 (Estate Bottled, Domaine de la Romanee Conti) . . . 3.98 43.00

The wines of the Domaine de la Romanee Conti have consistently commanded the highest price on the world market for its red
wines. It is perhaps the most valuable piece of vineyard ground in all of Burgundy, with the possible exception of the Romanee
Conti vineyard itself, is “La Tache”. The owners of the Domaine are particularly proud of the breed, lightness and balance
ee by La Tache during the 1950 vintage. An exceptional opportunity to acquire a thoroughbred red wine at relatively
modest cost.

298 MUSIGNY, VIELLE VIGNES, 1949 (Estate Bottled, Comte de Vogue) . . 444 48.00

The 25 acre vineyard known as Musigny produces some of the most remarkable red wine of Burgundy. It is particularly note-
worthy for its glorious bouquet and intriguing subtleness. We fortunately were able to obtain 20 cases — all from prephylloxera
vines.

Frank Schoonmaker considers this one of the best examples of white Burgundy he has run across during his recent trips to the
vineyards. In his tasting notes, he gave it 19 points out of a possible maximum of 20. Extraordinary bouquet and flavor. Avail-
able in half bottles.

274. MEURSAULT PERRIERES 1952 (Estate Bottled, Morey) i eer =e y 2 D299: «3465

The white wines of Meursault are among the greatest of Burgundy; a bit softer and less authoritative than Le Montrachet.
One would have to look long and hard to find a better example of Meursault.

Bottle Case
317 LE-MONTRACHET 1952 (Estate Bottled, J. Monnot) . . . . . +. v.60 65.00

Please forgive our enthusiasm as we proclaim this the best single dry white wine we have ever tasted out of France. It possesses
an almost supernatural bouquet and great depth of flavor. The total production did not exceed 40 cases so we urge that you
order quickly before this noble great white wine becomes depleted.

Col Courbé, in its interesting crooked neck bottle, is a fine example of the delicacy, and aromatic bouquet that can be achieved
by a well made Cognac. It is no ordinary event to be able to obtain a brandy as satisfactory as this one for a price as low as
