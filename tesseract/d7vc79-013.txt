PERNOD FROM FRANCE

PERNOD is. a ‘good fa-
miliar creature’ through-
out France, Spain, and
Italy. It is as basic to a
European’s bar as bour-
bon, scotch, and vodka
are to the American bar.
Because of jet travel to
the Continent, the habit
of drinking Pernod has
caught on among Ameri-
cans and it is now be-
coming increasingly
popular here. Usually, it
is drunk over ice cubes,
diluted with water, turn-
ing cloudy with a pale
greenish tinge as the
water is added. Often, it
is served as an important
ingredient in cooking, or
a drop or two is added to
give added vitality to
many cocktails.

If you would like to send
a gift that captures the
café flavor of France, we
know of none that does
it more symbolically than
Pernod. (Below 81.00

GRAND MARNIER FROM FRANCE

The sales graph for
GRAND MARNIER in the
United States has been
paralleling the same
growth rate as the sales
of Xerox. Perhaps it is
because the subtle com-
bination of flavors of
orange and brandy which
provide the base is prov-
ing so habit-forming. Or
perhaps, because we are
living in an ever-growing
world of cookbook de-
votees, and it is playing
such an important part
in the preparation of so
many food dishes, in-
cluding ‘Grand Marnier
Soufflé’ and ‘Roast Duck
ala Grand Marnier’.
Whatever the reason, it
is quite apparent that
Grand Marnier has be-
come an important part
of the household bar and
kitchen of many Ameri-
cans. Certainly, it is the
kind of liqueur that lends
itself to gift-giving.

BEEFEATER GIN

Rarely has any spirit cap-
tured the enthusiasm of
the American public as
has BEEFEATER ENG-
LISH GIN. Only two dec-
ades ago, the name was
primarily associated with
a beautifully uniformed
guard protecting the
Tower of London and
other historic monu-
ments. Now, should you
stop the nearest passer-
by and ask him the
meaning of ‘Beefeater’,
he will respond with ‘the
best gin in the world’. We
suspect future dictionar-
ies will record this fact.
If you have a friend who
likes gin, can you think
of a better gift to send
him than a few bottles of
BEEFEATER?

MARTELL V.S.0.P. COGNAC

For several years now,
we have seen the smiling
countenance of Michel
Martell in magazines
throughout the world ex-
tolling the virtues of the
brandy that he produces
in Cognac. Reports have
it that his smile reflects
his joy in ultimately
achieving the cognac
blend that he was striving
for— his much appreci-
ated ‘V.S.O.P.’

If you observe carefully
as you inhale and drink,
you will notice richness
of flavor coupled with
lightness and finesse —
you will equally notice
great delicacy in the bou-
quet — these are the very
elements that make cog-
nac what it is. We recom-
mend it. It will be appre-
ciated as a gift — or why
not indulge in the pleas-
urable joy of drinking it
yourself? (Below 119.96
