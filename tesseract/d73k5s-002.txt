THE RENOWNED BEAUJOLAIS AND MACON BLANCS

oF GEORGES DUBOEUF
WILL REACH OUR CELLARS IN EARLY AUGUST

Georges Duboeuf is the acknowledged Dean of wine-makers and wine merchants in the Beaujolais-Macon area.

Our colleagues, Sam and Michael Aaron, visited M. Duboeuf at his impressive cellars at Villefranche last April. They enjoyed a long day of

tasting, during which over 70 barrels were tried

the very best of Beaujolais and the Maconnais.

Weselected those cuvees that best express the freshness and fruit of Beaujolais, and the delicate Chardonnay flavor of Macon. Several of these
wines have subsequently won Gold Awards against the leading wine producers of each region. It is with great pride that we bring these

bottles to the discriminating wine lovers of America.

Each of the nine wines listed below are ‘best of class—the finest wines that Beaujolais’ premier wine producer has to offer. We urge you to

try them. Once you do, we're sure you will agree.
