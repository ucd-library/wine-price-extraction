The wonderful 1978
Beaujolais Nouveau has arrived!

BEAUJOLAIS PRIMEUR, Pellerin........... 3.79 43.95
Paris and Lyon are agog! The new
Beaujolais of the great 1978 vintage
is being poured freely with abandon
from barrel and bottle—and only a
scarce three months after the grapes
were picked. Now New Yorkers can
join in this joyous celebration-—the
superb Pellerin Beaujolais 1978 is
here, just in time for your own holi-
day celebration and for gift-giving.
At this price, it will go quickly.Sug-
gest ordering promptly.
BEAUJOLAIS PRIMEUR, Piat.............. 4.49 48.50
Did you see our ad in the New York Times extolling the virtues of
Piat’s selection? Here is the very charming, fruity, engaging wine
that is the popular star of the bistros and restaurants of Paris.
Serve slightly chilled. Enjoy it now—for by the Summer, just as
freshly-picked strawberries and wild daisies, its youthful
vivacity will slowly fade with time.
