Five thousand dollars invested in wine this year will grow in value much faster than
interest rates—the intangible dividends cannot be measured by any Dow-Jones index,
but are equally real”.

The above is a quote from the current December issue of TOWN &

COUNTRY Magazine. (We recommend that the wine lover stroll to the

nearest newstand and get his copy of December’s TOWN & COUNTRY

—in it you will find an informative, entertaining article describing “How

to Lay Down A Wine Cellar’—it talks not only about the more mature

mast vintages that are ready for drinking, but also how to wisely acquire, and
from what areas, such current years as 1966 and 1967.)

proved much too light and were lacking in balance and color—and the
early reports about the 1968 vintage indicate a dismal harvest. As we go
to press, we learn that the diminishing quantity of ’66s that remain in
Burgundian cellars have gone up on an average of 20”; during the last
few months.

As wine drinkers, should you want to anticipate, by all means buy your
estate-bottled 1966 red Burgundy now while full selection is available
and the prices are still under reasonable control. And, as a further div-
idend in Burgundy, most of the ‘66s are proving to be charming for
present day drinking, the bigger ones can be counted on to gain com-
plexity and added bouquet and stature for at least another decade.

If this quotation has any validity, we know of no vintage in recent years
Be an to justify investment more than the classic, truly great year of 1966 in
é Burgundy. ’66 has all of the earmarks of longevity, exhibiting great
fragrance, fruit, sufficient tannin and superb balance. The wisdom of ac-
oa quiring 1966 red Burgundies is further testified to by the fact that the ’67s

Our tasting notes read, ‘finesse rather than power is distinguishing char-
acteristic here; relatively light but great breed’,

the north. Full, rich, very distinguished.

1074 CLOS DE VOUGEOT, Grivot ...... 6.79 = 73.35

produced. Schoonmaker states, “distinguished more for its breed and
bouquet than for its body and power.”

916 CORTON, Cuvee Docteur Peste ..... 7.79 84.15
Consistently commands the highest price of any of the barrels offered
at the Hospices de Beaune auction. Noble heritage. Only 480 cases pro-
duced. By far, the greatest single red wine vineyard of the Cote de
Beaune and the Hospices sale.

Comte de Vogue ...............::: 16.50 178.00

A small portion of this 16-acre treasured vineyard is still planted in pre-
phylloxera vines that pre-date the 1870s. It remains the proud property
of Comte de Vogue. Most experts agree that this noble, long-lived, Bur-
gundian classic represents the highest heights achievable on the Cote
d'Or. We were fortunate to be able to obtain a few cases.

immediate delivery—at $3.00 the case additional.
