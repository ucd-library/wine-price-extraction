You will be delighted with our well-informed, friendly, smiling sales staff. We
offer the largest selection of wines and spirits in the U.S. for you to choose from.

Let’s think ahead. Our associate, Sam Aaron, spends each Spring weekend and
every Summer on Long Island. Since this has been going on for over two dec-
ades, Mr. Aaron believes he can suggest what is most practical and meaningful
for entertaining on the Island. After consultation with his close friend James
Beard, one of America’s leading authority on food and wine, and Clifton Fadiman,
his co-author of the book, THE JOYS OF WINE, he comes up with the following
jewels for those who want to stock up for the season ahead. Mr. Aaron has put
as much stress on economic advantage as he has on excellence, so you will not
only have the best—but will save.

BUMATE SOAVE 1976 5 oro ok a ea ee 22.95
Soave is undoubtedly the most charming dry white wine of Italy. We have tasted
many that sell for over 50% more than this one—but our tasting panel tells us
Burati’s came out first in a blind tasting. Buy a case—fortify against the imminent
onslaught of the Summer:sun.

TALEESERAND GRAVES 1978... 5. he, ee ee. 26.15

will deliver in May—and you will be well prepared for the Summer demands of
your guests.

ZELTINGER HIMMELREICH 1973........ Ee Os td ee eT 34.10
Don’t let the big words discourage you. This is one of the best Moselles we have
ever tasted. Fresh, light, of intriguing, delicate bouquet. Will be the hit of any
terrace luncheon you plan.

PINOT: GHARDONNAY, LES GCHARMES 1975, .. 2. ose et ee 34. 75
For those who want to drink remarkably fine dry white wine at low cost. Won
GOLD AWARD at Paris Fair for being the best Pinot Chardonnay produced in
Macon during the excellent 1975 vintage. Tastes like a $60.00 the case wine. Fea-
tured in practically every good French restaurant i in New York City. Superb for
Summer entertaining.

MUSCADET-SUR-4IE 10976 | oo yes ee a ea 34.75
Estate-bottled at Chateau Briace. Won GOLD AWARD for the best Muscadet of
that year. Dry, clean, light—the kind of wine you serve icy cold instead of a martini
before dinner—particularly when warm weather hits the Hamptons and the South
Shore.

MEURSAULT, CASSE TETE 1973 (Estate of R. Thevenin).............. 68.50
What a wine! Big, vigorous—will compete with the white wines of the Montrachet

CHARCOAL GRILLING AND PICNICS

 

COTES-DU-RHONE ROUGE 1975..........6.0--0lecceceeeeees ae 28.40

Will let you in on a secret. This is the very wine that Craig Claiborne serves day-in
and day-out at his Easthampton gastronomic shrine. Why? He is a man who loves
good red wine that pleases his palate and does not damage his purse too severely.

This is no ordinary red wine from the Rhone Valley but from La Vieille Ferme
which is considered the best single source of red wine in the Avignon area.
SAUMUR CHAMPIGNY 1973 (Domaine de |’Oratoire)................. 29.95
Did you know that the village of Saumur is in the Loire and produces one of the
most charming red wines of France? It is the kind of wine that enlivens the 1-star
and 2-star restaurants of the French provinces. We love it—think it is worth twice
the price-Perfect for warm weather menus.

BEAUJOLAIS 1975 (Marquis de Roussy de Sales)..............-..0+-5: 34.10
There is Beaujolais and Beaujolais. Some are poor and some are outstanding. Here
is one of the best and is worth over $4.00 the bottle. Why? It is produced by
Marquis de Roussy de Sales, the proud proprietor of Chateau de La Chaize. Every
drop is from the best soil of the Beaujolais area. It is rich, fruity, and should be
served cool with the hamburgers and steaks as they come off the grill.

1972 RED BORDEAUX

Slow to mature, 1972 has been overlooked

remains, to most of the world, a secret, but not inside
the Bordeaux wine trade.”

1969 RED BORDEAUX

1969 is an excellent, but overlooked vintage,
producing fine slow-maturing wines, particu-
larly in the Medoc and Graves. The Chateau
La Mission Haut Brion 1969 at $89.50 the
case, might easily prove the best value in great
red wine on this entire page.

gundy of great interest and excellence.

STAG’S LEAP GAMAY BEAUJOLAIS

TOTS ee ee Ser a ee 47.88
It was Stag’s Leap Cabernet Sauvignon (next shipment

CR BMUINER Yo a Ce ae 56.90
Outside of Chateau Yquem, this is the best Sauternes
produced in 1971. Dramatically rich.

CHATEAU GLORIA 1975 (St. Julien) 69.95
One of the most heralded wines of the great 1975 vintage
is Chateau Gloria. You can buy it now at only $69.95

MICHEL GUERARD CHAMPAGNE

MONR ee oe 97.09
Michel Guerard’s restaurant, a gastronomic shrine, was
the only one that was newly awarded the coveted 3-star
category by Guide Michelin. The Champagne served at
this 3-star dining mecca proudly bears the name
CHAMPAGNE MICHEL GUERARD BRUT. It is ele-
gant, bone-dry, perfectly balanced, and is capable of
holding its own against other French Champagnes that
approach $300.00 the case.

CHATEAU MOUTON ROTHSCHILD

PE oe er A a, 185.00
Pablo Picasso created the 1973 Mouton label and Andy
Warhol is the proud artist who executed the label for this
great 1975—perhaps the best single wine produced in
all of Bordeaux during this extraordinary great vintage.
This 1975 will be delivered in 1978 but you can buy it
now for only $185.00. It will probably approach $300.00
in cost after it is put in bottle and delivered to America.

Romanee Conti for only $226.26 the case. The normal
