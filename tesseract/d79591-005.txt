WINE KNOWLEDGE HITS
A NEW MILESTONE

ALEXIS LICHINE’S ENCYCLOPEDIA OF
WINES & SPIRITS, attempts to put
within the confines of two covers all
relevant knowledge on the subject of
wine—12 years in the making. Pub-
lished by Alfred Knopf.

by SAM AARON

have spent the last 35 years of

my life in the wine trade and
have watched wine information
move from the four page folder, to a
simple primer, to 200 page books en-
titled “All about Wine,” and finally,
adequate communication about the
subject of wines requiring a 700
page over-sized book which will not
be read simply by the trade, but by
thousands of consumers everywhere.

I remember, and it was not too
long ago, the status symbol was the
Cadillac, then it became Hi Fi, then
the trip to Paris, and now, in our
leisurely affluent society, it is the
building of the wine cellar, whether
it be in the living room or the attic—
and as a corollary, acquiring more
and more knowledge about the sub-
ject of the vine and the grape. It
used to be enough to recognize the
name of a Chateau Haut Brion as a
First Growth. Now the wine drinker
also wants to know that Chateau
Haut Brion is owned by the Dillon
family, that it produces 800 cases of
white and 10,000 cases of red, that
it is worth drinking in off years, and
that the 1952 is not quite the equal
of Haut Brion’s 1955. And so it goes
with the other vineyards.

The Art collector used to be con-
tent with his books and the Metro-
politan Museum. Now he goes to the
Louvre and the Prado—and so the
inquisitive wine drinker finds it re-
warding to visit Lafite Rothschild,
Romanee Conti and Moet & Chan-
don. He wants to know as much as
he can, and learn about it first hand
at the vineyard. It is hard for the
wine merchant to keep up with his
more advanced wine clientele.

It is to this group of wine drinkers
that Lichine’s Encyclopedia is ad-
dressed. Many of them, like Balboa
first looking at the Pacific, will get
a sense of discovery and excitement
as they learn intimate details about
the wines they have been drinking
through the years. It is a big, over-

sized and important book as its price
of $15.00 will testify. However, it
will prove a worthwhile investment,
even for the beginner who wants to
start learning as much as he can
about the grape and the vine.

It actually consists of several
books, including the history of spir-
its as well as wines, chapters on
wine and food, how to serve wine,
starting a wine cellar, how wine is
made, etc. The heart of the Encyclo-
pedia is an alphabetical arrange-
ment covering every important
phase of wine and every significant
vinevard of the world. It is certainly
an indispensable reference book for
anv wine lover. But, even more im-
portant, is the fact that the reader
will find many happy hours of pleas-
ant browsing as he turns through its
over 700 pages.

I have long been aware of Alfred
Knopf’s reputation as a perfectionist
and conservative publisher. From
what I can judge, I suspect the first
edition of 15,000 copies will hardly
be enough to take care of the im-
mediate demand. If you want to

take out an insurance policy and
avoid disappointment by ordering
now, the easiest way is to simply
mail a check for $15.00 (add 75¢
Sales Tax in N.Y.C.) to COLONY
BOOKS. INC., 651 Madison Ave-
nue, New York, N.Y. 10021 (or, if
you prefer, Colony will send you the

book and bill you for $15.00 later).

I am also happy to report that
Alexis Lichine has autographed
each copy and anyone who orders
now will receive an autographed
copy. Colony also assures us that
they will deliver the book, post paid
free, to any address within the

~

United States. Since Christmas will

soon be upon us, you can send a gift
card along and an autographed book
will be delivered promptly, bearing
your christmas greetings.
