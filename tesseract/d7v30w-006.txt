Robert M. Parker, Jr., sings the praises of Perrier-Jouet Grand Brut:
“Delightfully fresh, creamy, fruity and frothy”

Champagne can often be better than vintage Champagne. Perrier-Jouet Grand
F Brut is rich and well-balanced, flavorsome and bone dry, revealing in full measure the
elements that constitute a great Champagne.

 

| % errier-Jouet Grand Brut 150th Anniversary Cuvee demonstrates that non-vintage

Perrier-Jouet is a relatively small Champagne firm that specializes in superior non-vintage and a
remarkable grande marque Champagne—Fleur de Champagne.

The 150th Anniversary Cuvee celebrates 150 years of Champagne shipments from Perrier-
Jouet to the United States. The excellence of this wine reflects the importance of the occasion. It is
also of historic interest to note that in the 19th century Perrier-Jouet were purveyors of
Champagne to Leopold I of the Belgians, Emperor Napoleon III and Queen Victoria.

Perrier-Jouet’s world-famous Grand Brut normally fetches over $22 the bottle in most wine

shops (and it sells for $28 in Paris wine shops!). To add money-saving cheer to your summer
entertaining and weekend gift-giving, we now offer it on sale at $15.95 the bottle, $188.00 the

case. (94)
