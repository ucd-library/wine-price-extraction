shall never forget the dinner for forty which he gave us in his
cellars. It was a dinner of great specialties from all over France,
each one perfectly cooked, for Bernard Grivelet is a gourmet of
high order . . . as for the wines, we started with a Montrachet
1947 and then on to a 1934. Both were perfection as far as white
wines go and then two Chambolle Musignys of 1934 and 1929
vintage, followed by Richebourg 1945 with the cheese .. .

Chablis

The truly remarkable Chablis produced by M. Servin (to be had
at Sherry’s). He, his wife and son, and a 91 year old grandfather,
own parts of several of the best vineyards. Their simple life is
toil, toil, toil, with no other thought than the vine and its nectar.
Though world famous for their Chablis, they live without modern
comforts, and in a way most American farmers would shun, but
they produce as great a Chablis as there is to be found anywhere.
We tasted the 1948s and the 1949s and then a bottle of the
Chablis Preuses 1947, which is a wine that I will never forget

. after visiting Simmonet and two or three other producers in
Chablis, you respect these growers who are toiling constantly to
produce honest, fine wine which are bottled where they are made
and where every step from picking to labeling, is the effort of the
producer.

Romanee Conti

Though the Domaine de la Romanee Conti has fully earned
its reputation as the wine shrine of the world, there is no touch
of grandeur that meets the eye here. One is impressed by its utter
simplicity — the flowers in the rather shabby courtyard — the
formidable qualities of the wife of the regisseur, who reigns in
that courtyard. Here again, one is amazed with the smallness of
the cellar, although it is relatively large for Burgundy. We tasted
the recent vintages of Richebourg, Echezeaux, Grand Echezeaux
and La Tache. We were denied the privilege of tasting the
Romanee Conti, since the vineyard was replanted in 1945 and will
not yield again for some time. Each bottle in this cellar is a wine
treasure — and I share the pride of Sherry’s, who are able to
offer the choicest wines of the Domaine, dating as far back as
the great 1934 vintage, to its customers. I doubt that there is
a wine cellar in all of France that even closely competes with
Sherry’s collection of these wines.

Montrachet

We were impressed by the utter shabbiness of the two old villages
of Puligny Montrachet and Chassagne Montrachet which share the
Le Montrachet vineyard, the source of one of the world’s greatest
white wines and certainly the best white wine in all of France...
also impressed by Alexis Lichine, an American who enjoys a
reputation in the Burgundy district as one of the great wine
experts of the world ... the incredible wonder of the flavor of
true Montrachet, be it young or old... the delightful life that
Monsieur and Madame Monnot, who own a small section of
Montrachet have made for themselves in that small community
... their charming cottage, picturesque garden, and warm friendly
dispositions are sign enough of the pleasant companionable lives

which they lead together. All the Montrachet that they produce
in a year does not fill one barrel of their tiny cellar. It’s a wine
of such perfection, that it seems a shame there cannot be more.
All of the 1947 vintage, and this does not equal 30 cases, has
found its way to Sherry Wine & Spirits. If any remains when
you read this, my advice is that you acquire some... Less than a
mile away from the Monnot’s, we found the Ramonet family, who
produce some of the finest Chassagne Montrachet, both red and
white. Here is a family 100% of the soil, who live entirely without
conveniences, and with only the hardest work to keep them going.
And yet, from these meager surroundings, the finest of wines
come forth. Only complete devotion to the soil and the vine can
perform the miracles that are necessary for truly great wine.

Trip Through Alsace — .

I think I was very fortunate in picking the right time to visit
with the Dolfi family in Alsace. Not only was the country at its
best—we stayed in a small hotel in the Vosges mountains with a
breathtaking view of trees, valley and hills—but the fruit season
was at its height. The cherries were arriving daily for the famous
Kirsch, the wild raspberries for the Eau-de-Vie de Framboise and

the black currants for the Creme de Cassis. It is also surprising to
see the amount of Kirsch, Mirabelle and Framboise there is
stored in great vats for aging. It is certainly not at all baffling to
understand why these eaux-de-vie are not cheap, for it takes 200
pounds of raspberries to make ten litres... . Renauld Dolfi proudly

NEWS ABOUT THE Ff

 

Certainly one of the top ten of Paris’ eight thousand restaurants
is LE BERKELEY in the hotel of the same name at the Rond
Point of the Champs Elysees. Besides being beautifully situated
with a view of the park and trees and having a completely charm-
ing atmosphere, there is excellent food and a fine cellar. Monsieur
Jean is a demanding patron and as a result, the service is really
unusual. There are excellent hors d’oeuvre, a plate called Toutes
les Crudités, which is one of the most perfect presentations of raw
vegetables I have ever seen—and with a wonderful dunking sauce
which is a specialty of the house. You will, if you are a lover of
kidneys, find that the special way in which they are prepared and
flambéed at the Berkeley is a gastronomic experience of the first
order. And there is sole with thin slices of courgette (zucchini)
sautéed and served over the sole. The blend of the two flavors is
something delightful to the palate.

Excellent young chicken grilled perfectly is another dish to
remember at the Berkeley, and I have it on the authority of a
person who knows, that the chickens are solely raised for their
eventual slaughter and sacrifice to Jean’s clients. If you are home-
sick for a hamburger steak—it is there, and well done. Served in
the fashion which has become the accepted thing in Paris, topped
with a fried egg, it is an excellent entree. There is a very good still
Champagne at the Berkeley and a specialty of Moet’s Dom
Perignon—we drank the 1943 at a farewell lunch given to Jack
Aaron, and an elegant Champagne it was. The Berkeley is defi-
nitely one of the really.great restaurants of Paris where you will
always find fine food.and really pleasant surroundings... ..

A restaurant high in my estimation ii MAISON GAFNER
at 14 Rue Dauphine near the Pont Neuf, Madam Gafner is the
guiding spirit and it is she who treks across. the Pont Neuf with
her barrow in the early motning to find the choicest food for the
day’s menu. Her Sole Meunier and Frogs Legs Provencale are
perfection . . . another small restaurant in the same neighborhood
that is worth visiting, is LE CATALAN at 16 Rue des Grande
Augustins ... it is certainly worth your while to trek across the
bridge to find it... . I'll be treking back next month. See you in
the shop in November. —JAMES BEARD
