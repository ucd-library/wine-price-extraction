Here is no ordinary Champagne, but one whose roots go
deep into French history. The graceful decanter bottle
which houses this remarkable 1971 vintage Champagne,
was designed for the Prince Imperial who later became
Napoleon IIl—hence the name “Champagne des
Princes” The House of de Venoge, established in 1837,
received the Royal Warrant from Napoleon Ill during the
Second Empire.

 

What makes this Champagne different and superior?

1) The Champagne is produced predominantly from
Pinot Chardonnay grapes grown at de Venoge’s own
vineyard, rather than having been purchased from neigh-
boring farmers as is usually the practice.

2) The demand for this Champagne has been so intense
in France, Belgium and Great Britain, that this shipment
marks the first time any has been allocated to the U.S.

3) The de Venoge Champagne has a reputation of pro-
viding the most complex taste sensation as compared to
any other Champagne in the world. It is not an easy
accomplishment to produce a full-bodied, yet delicate
Champagne at the same time.

A word about the decanter. It is not Baccarat—but it will
remain a happy addition to the home, long after the con-
tents have been joyously imbibed. Quantity limited, so
please order promptly. (250.50 case)
