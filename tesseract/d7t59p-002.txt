306 CHAMBERTIN, CLOS DE BEZE (Pierre Gelin) 148.50 133.65

A 37 acre vineyard so celebrated that its magnificent red wines
are legally entitled to the name 'Chambertin', but more often,
the proprietor prefers to use the more specific name 'Clos de Beze',

491  * WVOSNE ROMANEE, LA GRANDE RUE (H. Lamarche) 17820 2 160.40
We quote from Frank Schoonmaker's Encyclopedia, "La Grande | |
Rue - its wine is altogether astonishing; produced by old vines and
in extremely small quantity, it is unsurpassed, perhaps even
unequalled, by Romanee Conti, Richebourg and La Tache. It
would be impossible to give higher praise".

ADVANCE OFFERING OF THE 1970 WHITE BURGUNDIES

a grace and elegance, a fragrance, freshness and charm that | have never seen surpassed and rarely
equalled in thirty years of tasting. Do not expect these miraculous bottles to last forever, but you
can safely buy a three or four years' supply".

600 AUXEY DURESSES BLANC (Rene Roy) 43.10 © 38.80 |

A 'discovery' for those who want truly outstanding white Burgundy
without paying a much higher price just for the privilege of
obtaining a more famous name.

503. * CHABLIS BEUGNONS (Domaine Vocoret) 43.10
Premier Cru Chablis vineyard - estate-bottled by Robert Vocoret,
the Mayor of Chablis, who is particularly proud of what he has
harvested during the 1970 vintage.

38.80

326 * MEURSAULT (Domaine Matrot) 43.10 38.80

Until recently, a superior Meursault has always commanded a

higher price than Pouilly-Fuissé - now the scarcity and popularity

of good Pouilly-Fuisse has reversed the process. In our opinion,

here is truly superior white Burgundy at enticingly low cost.
540 * POUILLY-FUISSE (Domaine Laneyrie) 48 .50 43.65
If the growers of Pouilly and Fuissé were to select the best single
example grown in these two picturesque wine towns, we strongly
suspect it would be this noble wine produced by M. Laneyrie, the
President of the Wine Growers Association.

 

447 * CHABLIS, MONTEE DE TONNERRE (Domaine Vocoret) 48 .50 43.65
The best of the Premier Cru vineyards of Chablis. Great distincfion :

and bouquet - certainly in the class of Grand Cru.

 

47] * PULIGNY MONTRACHET (Domaine Sauzet) 48.50 AS
Lucien Sauzet is the President of the Burgundy White Wine Growers. i
In the noble soil of Puligny, inspired by his dedication, a great
white Burgundy is achieved here.

 

* Wines bearing an asterisk are available in half bottles at $3.00 additional.
