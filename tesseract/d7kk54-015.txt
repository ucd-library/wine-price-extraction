BORDEAUX

Terry Robards' column in the Sunday Magazine of the NEW YORK TIMES
(August 17) talks enthusiastically of a 'Renaissance of White Bordeaux.' "In

 

good vintages like the 1978 and '/9,” says Mr. Robards, “they are crisp, dry

and laden with the fruit of the Sauvignon: Blanc and Semillon grapes." Look
to white Bordeaux for some of the best values in white wine on the market.
