In his remarkable book published by Gourmet
Magazine, “Bouquet de France,” Samuel Cham-
berlain states, “Over a period of years La Re-
serve has represented the ultimate in luxurious
appointments, in Lucullan food and in flawless
wines. Here is one of the great restaurants of
France.” Perhaps the most popular of the wines
in its magnificent cellars is this young, sprightly,
“Provence Rose” of the superb 1952 vintage
in its handsome, slender bottle which proudly
bears the indication “La Reserve de Beaulieu”
on its label — a wine from the Cote d’Azur
that will add much pleasure during the Summer
days ahead — pink wine at its best. Available
in half bottles at 99c each, $21.95 the case.
