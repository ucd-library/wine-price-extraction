LAND PINE BUCKET will lend added
charm, beauty, and individuality to your
selection of wines and spirits. The tradi-
tion of early America, beautifully cap-
tured by this hand-hewn bucket, is further
enhanced with a replica of a Currier &
Ives print. Choose any six to twelve bot-
tles’shown in this catalogue—add only
$9.75 additional for bucket. (Retails in
America’s leading gift shops for $18.00—
and well worth it.)

These handsome, useful, strong CUR-
RIER & IVES BUCKETS were an in-
tegral part of New England life during
the 19th Century. They are still being
made today in the same New Hampshire
country area—the only difference is that
finer wood is used, a Currier & Ives print
is affixed, and they are artistically stained
so that the bucket can be a decorative ob-
ject in any household. We can think of
no more imaginative container to send
your selection of wines and spirits than
the FIRKIN. The gift will be doubly
appreciated. Since the quantity we have
available of these buckets is limited, we
suggest early ordering.

All gifts listed here include the price of
the container, when a container is speci-
fied. However, you can substitute one con-
tainer for another and we will credit or
add any price differential that might be
involved. Immediately following, on Page
4, please look at the other container selec-
tions which include the “Can-Can,” the
traditional Wicker Hamper, the Tote Bag,
the James Beard Wine Rack, the Karry
Keg, or the “Savoy Luggager.” The choice
of container is yours. It should be pointed
out that even if you do not select a con-
tainer, the gifts can be sent in our stand-
ard gift wrapping without added cost.
