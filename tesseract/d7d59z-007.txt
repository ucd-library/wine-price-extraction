TRUE VINTAGE PORTS

 

A true vintage Port is a wine made exclusively from the grapes of an extraordinary

year. It rests in barrel two years and is then put in bottle. Slow maturation in the
sottle is the secret -- this brings out the depth, intensity and drama,

ane ;
1763 and 1960 are two of the great vintage years of our generation. The house of

Warre is acknowled c d as one of the greatest single source of vintage ports. The
quantities of each of these superb wines is limited, so we suggest early acquisition,

ADVANCE OFFERING OF THE GREAT 1975 BORDEAUX

We feel it is our obligation as wine merchants to make you aware that the great 1975 red wines of

30rdeaux can be acquired now, and at prices that will certainly prove to be lower than what you will
orobably have to ultimately pay for them in the future.

The wine drinkers of the world have quickly recognized the intrinsic excellence of the 1975s in Bordeaux.
The verdict is now in. 1975 is one of the great red Bordeaux vintages of our generation. It is in the
classic, complex, powerful, long-lived tradition of 1945, 1961, 1966 and 1970 - wines designed for
laying down that will surely increase in excellence and value with each passing year.

Rather than reflect the current higher replacement cost in Bordeaux for the 1975 vintage, we have

decided to base our quotations on the lower, earlier acquisition cost. If the famed First Growths exceed
your wine budget, there are many excellent alternatives including some remarkable examples well below
$100 the case. If you are a wine lover who thinks ahead, the offerings below are worthy of your attention

THE GREAT, GREAT FIRST GROWTHS OF THE 1975 VINTAGE
No. Price per Cas

er If Acquired N

A-1] CHATEAU MOUTON ROTHSCHILD (Pauillac)
Wine lovers should pause here. Many Bordeaux wine experts consider Chateau 185.00
Mouton Rothschild 1975 perhaps the best single red wine produced during this
illustrious year. Its current wholesale price in Bordeaux is close to $200 the
case. We have managed to persuade the vineyard to part with a reasonable
quantity at the early low opening price. We are passing all of the savings on
to you. Now - while our limited inventory exists - is the time to acquire the
great, great Mouton 1975 at the wonderfully low price of $185 the case. Also
available in magnums and half-bottles at $3 the case additional.

A-40 CHATEAU LATOUR (Pauillac) 185.00
Full-bodied, firm, but with exceptional softness and fruit in 1975. Will live for
decades.

A-12 CHATEAU HAUT BRION (Graves) 190.00

Here power is combined with elegance. A remarkable Graves.

A-4] CHATEAU CHEVAL BLANC (St. Emilion) 194.00
As in Petrus, the Merlot grape comes through and imparts fruit, roundness, and
richness. Here is one of the best Cheval Blancs produced during our generation.

A-14 CHATEAU PETRUS (Pomerol) 198.00
Dramatic velvetiness - a glory. There are only 16 acres of Petrus and it is the most
difficult wine of Bordeaux to come by. The fact that we have obtained it at all is
a minor wine miracle. Only a few cases - so act quickly.

A-13 CHATEAU LAFITE ROTHSCHILD (Pauillac) 199.00
We have watched the Lafite 1951 and 1959 climb to $750 the case and beyond.
Lafite 1966 approaches $400, and Lafite 1970 is about $300. Since 1975 may

surpass some of these as vintage years, what will Lafite command in 1982?

THE GREAT SECOND GROWTHS OF THE 1975 VINTAGE

In 1855, sixty-two vineyards of Bordeaux were classified as great growths. All were great - and these
sixty-two members of wine royalty were broken up into five growths. With the exception of Haut Brion,

the great growths were limited to the Medoc. Since then, the outstanding wines of St. Emilion, Pomerol
and Graves share equal recognition.

In effect, the wines listed below are of the royal family of the Bordeaux vineyards - there are no commone
here. These include Kings, Princes, Dukes, Marquis and Counts. In this exalted world of great wines of
great vintage years, it is possible to get noble wines of great character within the liveable economic range
of $60 to $100 the case. They are surely destined to climb upwards with the passage of time.

A-45 = CHATEAU GRAND PUY DUCASSE (Pauillac) 37.70
Distinguished for balance and depth of flavor, the vineyards are contiguous to Lafite
and Mouton in the north. In a recent tasting devon exclusively to Second Growths,
Grand Puy Ducasse won second place with its '73, and first place with its '74! The
total production is less than 10,000 cases. At $59.75, now is the time to acquire
this great, great red Bordeaux. Boho

A-47, CHATEAU DURFORT VIVENS (Margaux) 69°75
A great Second Growth. In the exalted leage of Leoville Las Cases, Rausan Segla,
Pichon Lalande, Montrose, and Ducru Beaucaillou. $69.75 makes es thoroughbred
a bargain.

 

A-55 CHATEAU PRIEURE-LICHINE (Margaux) 74.50
Alexis Lichine, the proprietor, has devoted the last twenty years to regroup and
reconstitute the vineyards on the best hilly ground of the Margaux-Cantenac area.
By acquiring some of the best land of the area, the dedicated wine-wise Lichine
has created a wine well above its Fourth Growth classification. There is little
question that it can compete in breed, softness, body and delicacy with any of

the Second Growths of the commune of Margaux. Recommended.

A-5 CHATEAU L'ANGELUS (St. Emilion) 76 .00
The great French restaurants of Paris and New York clamor for L'Angelus because
of its softness, fruitiness and deliciousness. We were lucky to get it at all due to
intense world demand.

A-23 CHATEAU LEOVILLE LAS CASES (St. Julien) 7750
Famed red wine that is always full of flavor and well balanced. As an equally
distinguished alternative, consider its neighbor, Chateau Gloria, listed below.

A-27 CHATEAU MONTROSE (St. Estephe) 72-50
Another great Second Growth. Slow to mature, extremely long-lived. Very
popular in England.

A-3 CHATEAU BRANE CANTENAC (Margaux) 79.50
Big, dependable. We prefer Chateau Prieure-Lichine from the Margaux area
which exhibits more balance and finesse.

A-15 CHATEAU DUHART MILON ROTHSCHILD (Pauillac) 80.00

Adjacent to Chateau Lafite, sharing the same proprietor, Baron Elie de Rothschild.
Elegance and depth are beautifully harmonized.

A-37 CHATEAU PICHON LALANDE (Pauillac) 84,00

Great Fullness and finesse, Lies directly adjacent to Chateau Latour - the two
wines have similar characteristics, although the Pichon matures more quickly.

A-9 CHATEAU DUCRU BEAUCAILLOU (St. Julien) 89.50

1

Wonderful name - means 'beautiful pebbles.' It is this gravely soil that produces

elegant, flowery, full-bodied wines such as this,
