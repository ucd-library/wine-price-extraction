TO DELIGHT THE

THE GREAT WHITE BURGUNDIES OF 1952 & 1953...
TWIN VINTAGE YEARS THAT WILL ADD JOY TO YOUR SUMMER LIVING

To find the greatest dry white wines of France, one must look to Burgundy. These wines particularly flourished
and reached new heights during the outstanding vintage years of 1952 and 1953 — remarkable twins
indeed! By now, half of the output has been consumed and the other half are in trade and consumer channels
with scarcity imminent. We proudly present this classic collection, the result of many vineyard visits and
careful tasting. They are perfect accompaniments to the lighter dishes that dominate warm weather menus.

Estate Bottled, Bouchard Pere et Fils

More people have learned to recognize the greatness and
depth of flavor of Corton Charlemagne — a wine that readily
holds its own with even the best of the Grand Montrachets.

GRAND MONTRACHET
i953. So: Ca ee Bee

Estate Bottled, Roland Thevenin

With the possible exception of Romanee Conti, no single
wine is more difficult to acquire than an estate bottled
Montrachet. The world demand is tremendous and yet there
are only 18 acres which yield a pitiably small quantity. It
is the ultimate in white Burgundy and we are happy to offer
a wine of this calibre at a price as relatively modest as this.
