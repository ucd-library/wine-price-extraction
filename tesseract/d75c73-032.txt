And just to the south there is Gumpoldskirchen, a show village—and but a bare 70 miles

ae With this cosmopolitan, crossroads-of-the world background, the wines cannot help being
sophisticated, and take on the gaiety, subtlety and zest of beloved Vienna.

This vineyard is one of the wine jewels of the von Metternich family—the

Emperor Franz Josef had a favorite wine and it was Loibner Kaiserwein.
His 1890 might have been good, but we question whether it surpassed this
1966. Perhaps the best single dry white wine of all Austria.
