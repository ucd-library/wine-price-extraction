GRANDE MARQUE BORDEAUX IN WOODEN WINE RACK

The good red wine of the Bordeaux region
of France finds high expression in Grande
Marque Rouge, from the distinguished
Dourthe Fréres firm at Moulis in the Médoc.
Just in time for Christmas, they have shipped
us a supply of this robust, full-flavored red
in a very attractive, very useful wooden wine
rack. As our photograph shows, this sturdy,
stackable rack holds a full case of the Grande
Marque—a perfect wine for everyday pleas-
ure. When the twelve bottles of wine have
been happily consumed, the handsome rack
will be waiting to hold more wine — another
supply of Grande Marque as well as anything
else you choose.
