Like Chardonnay, the Sau-
vignon Blanc grape is con-
sidered a noble variety
capable of producing top-
flight white wines—
particularly in such regions as
the Loire Valley, Bordeaux,
California and Australia. In
California this grape variety
also appears under the name
of Fume Blanc, and you will
find the finest examples of
this varietal—called Sauvignon
or Fume Blanc—listed below.
