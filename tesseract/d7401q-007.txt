The recently pub-
lished book, ‘Paris
Cuisine, published
hy Little. Rrown 2&:
Co., is a result of
two years of effort
by our associate,
James Beard. Many
of you know Mr.
Beard by meeting
him in the shop or
through his previous
writings in our
catalogs.

Now that the World Series and Daylight
Saving Time have become events in the
past, interest is once again renewed in the
theatre and ballet, Saturday football games,
dinner and cocktail parties, and the pleas-
ant imbibing of good wines and spirits.
Anticipating this, our staff has been occu-
pied carefully tasting wine after wine
these many months to make absolutely
certain that no dubious bottle would find
its way to our Fall wine list. A few of my
impressions are contained below.

My sensitivity to good wine
value compels me to talk about this first.
Earlier in this brochure there is a page
that talks about the nine wines from
Bellows & Co. on sale. I have tasted each
of these
and I have tasted each of them with my
meals. I can report whether you pick
the pleasant, agreeable Chateau Mouton
d’Armailhacq 1942 or the more classic,
stout Chateau Leoville Lascases 1937, you
will be drinking red wine that easily earns

the right to be

wines without accompaniment

called fine Claret. In my
opinion, it is quite a wine event to be able
to acquire such calibre at such cost. Nor
do I think that any of you will fail to
share my enthusiasm for the noble
‘Echezeaux 1947’, a proud red wine from
the flawless Domaine de la Romanee Conti.

ing wine event has just taken place. Under
the guidance of Alexis Lichine. a group of
prominent Americans have bought a vine-
yard, Chateau Lascombes, which is adjacent
to Chateau Margaux, right in the heart of
the wine growing area of Bordeaux. For
many decades, the Claret produced at this
Chateau has maintained high regard
among discriminating wine drinkers
throughout the world. The

tale, and it is an interesting tale, of its

interesting

acquisition by Americans, appeared in a
recent issue of Town & Country magazine.
The first shipment of Chateau Lascombes
1947 has just reached our cellars. We have

Many of
Our customers who live in Long Island or
Westchester have expressed amazement
over the speed with which their orders
reach them. It is not infrequent to have
someone call us after five in the evening
only to find the package in their home,
40 miles away, the following morning.
The answer is simple these deliveries
are made for us by United Parcel Service
which covers, with speedy efficiency, Long
Island, Westchester and the boroughs.
The reason I am mentioning this service
at this time, is because some of you may
be thinking about your Christmas gift list,
and this information can be of particular
value to you if your list covers a wide
area and you want to remove any possible
anxiety about your gift arriving before
Christmas.

Reports
from France and Germany would indicate
that this is a particularly good time to
acquire wines for laying down. The rea-
sons are quite simple. The 1949 vintage
was a success almost everywhere, but the
quantity produced was small. The 1950
vintage was remarkably fine among the
white Burgundies and the German wines,

but are of mc quality among the red

diocre
wines. The 1951 vintage was a complete
failure almost everywhere. The 1952 vin-
tage looks promising but the results are
thus far not certain. The low quantity of
truly top-flight wine produced since the
gteat 1947 vintage will surely result in
higher prices as the remaining quantity
gradually disappears. Among these pages
you will see great 1947 (including the
great wines of the Domaine de la Romance
Conti), 1949 and 1950 wines beautifully
suited for laying down. We certainly think
it would prove to be a sound investment to
obtain them now rather than wait until
they become more costly or unprocurable.
