RED BORDEAUX, CONT'D.

1951. A year to forget. Poor. Perhaps 8/20.

1950. Very good. Fine, rather light wines
which developed well and received less ap-
preciation than they deserved... and still
deserve, for that matter, when you can find
them. 14/20.

1949. Great, and in the classic Bordeaux
tradition. The wines ran true to form — the
First Growths obviously better than the Thirds,
and so on. The bigger wines are still not ready
now, and most of the others are off the market.
In general, 16/20.

1948. Sound, rather hard wines, never espe-
cially attractive. 13/20.

1947. A fabulous vintage, one in which the
“commoners” of the Bordeaux Country were
hardly less remarkable than the “Princes of
the Blood,” when the St. Emilions equalled
and surpassed the great Médocs, when every-
thing was topsy-turvy and everything wonder-
ful. There are hardly any left, and the few
that can still be found should be drunk at
once. Originally 20/20: 18/20 would be
fairer today.

1946. Never better than fair. 11/20.

1945. Very great. This, far more than 1955,
has a right to be called “the greatest year in
the Médoc since 1900.” Wines from the top
chateaux are now almost impossible to find.
but they are priceless — there are no better
Clarets on earth. 20/20.

WHITE BORDEAUX

1957. No better than fair. Exceedingly small
crop.

1956. Mediocre. Many wines hard and rather
green; several of the great vineyards refused
to chateau-bottle. 10/20.

1955. Great, although somewhat uneven.
The Graves are pleasant, rather on the dry
side; Sauternes less sweet than usual. 15/20.

1954. Poor. Wines light and often acid. A few
exceptions among the better Graves. 10/20.

1953. Great, especially in Sauternes, where
the wines have real distinction and class with-
out, however, attaining the peak quality of
the 1945s and 1947s. They nevertheless are,
and will remain through 1960 at least, the
best white Bordeaux commercially available.
17720.

1952. Good. Rather high in alcohol; many
wines have less fruit and breed than they
should. 15/20.

1949. Great. 17/20.

1947. Very great. 19/20.

1945. Very great. 19/20.
