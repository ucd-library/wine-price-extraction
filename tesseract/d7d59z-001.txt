CARRUADES DE CHATEAU LAFITE ROTHSCHILD 1987

1967 was the last vintage at Chateau Lafite
Rothschild that was bottled under the Carruades
label. This 1967 is therefore a collector's item,
available in limited quantity only, and will
never be replaced by any future vintages. The
ieee wine is truly superb and bears all the richness,

1968 complexity and distinction of a wine grown and
chateau-bottled at Lafite Rothschild.

“MIS EN BOUTEILLES AU CHATEAU

CHATEAU PETRUS 1972

(Po mero!)

We quote from Terry Robard's New
York Times Book of Wine, "The

unchallenged King of Pomerol is
Chateau Petrus; year atter year one | 1972

of the greatest red wines produced ‘PETRVS |

in the world. It is big and rich, i pone
but soft and elegant at the same i
time, reaching extraordinary peaks." i © ent Bis |
4 S |
Here is the only red wine of Bordeaux i =
that frequently commands a higher
price than Lafite. This is particularly |
true in a year such as 1972 when Petrus —
outshines Lafite. It must be remembered that Petrus produces great wine
regardless of vintage. Petrus 1972 makes a bid to being one of the best
clarets you are likely to run across - rich, full, dramatic; with enough
tannin to assure longevity.

 

\ piscine

 

At $9.95 the bottle, it is undoubtedly the best value in great red Bordeaux
available anywhere in the United States. A word of caution - we doubt
whether 300 cases exist in the country - none remains at the vineyard - so
we suggest you order quickly before it is all gone.

 

Also available in half-bottles and magnums at $3 the case additional.
CARRUADES DE CHATEAU LAFITE ROTHSCHILD 1966 (Pauillac) Sg
Here are the facts: 1) Chateau Lafite Rothschild 1966 now sells for
over $400 the case wholesale in Bordeaux and will probably approach
$1000 the case in a decade; 2) Carruades de Chateau Lafite Rothschild
1966 is the same wine but of younger vines. The difference between
them is subtle; 3) You can acquire a case of the Carruades 1966 now
for only $119. We predict it will triple in less than five years because
only a few hundred cases exist throughout the world.

CHATEAU LATOUR 1969 (Pauillac) P25
Not yet mature - will benefit from several more years in the cellar

- but acquire now at this low price.
