1407 DOUGLAS “BOARD MEMBERS CHOICE” =<. < ice 4.59 53.95

EXCITING NEWS FOR SCOTCH DRINKERS! You can maintain a high quality level in your Holiday entertaining by
serving one of Scotland’s most distinguished whiskies and yet pay the unbelievably low sale price of $4.59. It is not a
product of an obscure distillery, but was carefully blended, aged and bottled in Scotland by the 178 Year Old firm of
Alexander Sommervail. Candidly, whisky of this age and calibre would be good value at $6.00 or more—at this low sale
price, it is a Scotch opportunity not to be ignored.

1425 GLEN ALAN (Imported by S.S. PierceCo.)..... . 4.99 58.50

No ordinary Scotch this! A fully matured whisky from one of Scotland’s finest distilleries and imported by S. S. Pierce Co.
It is particularly clean, well balanced and pleasing. Recommended unreservedly to the discriminating Scotch drinker.

1491 FORTNUM & MASON’S RED SEAL . 5.99 68.50

Only last month, Fortnum & Mason celebrated their 250th anniversary—a store that has dominated
fashion and taste in London through the centuries. The distinguished Scotch whisky that bears their
name reflects this leadership. Exceptionally well balanced, rich in flavour, it is undoubtedly the best

value in fine Scotch whisky that prevails anywhere in the New York area.
