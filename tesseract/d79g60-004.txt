CHATEAU GREYSAC:- 1966 (Medoc)............4.....23. 2% @Eiwe... 3.33 35.96
Here is an interesting saga. Mr. Georges Hereil recently was President of Sud- es
Aviation and is acknowledged as the creator of the Caravelle. After a brief

stint as es esident of Lehmann Brothers International, he assumed the Presi- . 4
. . : - b deal
dency of Simca, now sitting on the Board of Chrysler Motors Corporation. But Reed :
Mr. He a has his diversions — one of them was the acquisition of Chateau eA
Greysac where he vowed to make one of the best red wines of the Medoc. He eae |

has succeeded eminently as demonstrated by this 1966 that is not only delicious Ly / :

CHATEAU DASSAULT 1686 (St. Emilion). .........3:34..-.25.3 ...«...c eee 2.99 32.30
MIS tm BOUTEILLES au CHATEAL The love affair between the creative industrialists and wine continues — follow-

ing the path of Georges Hereil, Marcel Dassault acquired an outstanding red
wine vineyard in St. Emilion. Mr. Dassault is the proprietor of ‘Jours de France’
and the creator of the famed Mirage and Mystére aircraft (known in America
as the Falcon Jet). His dedication has resulted in a top-flight St. Emilion that
still can be acquired at a relatively modest price.

SIMPLET ROUGE (Selected personally by Guy Schyler)........................... 1.79 19.35
How did this truly beautiful, well-balanced, delightful Claret reach our cellars?
Here is how it happened — one of our most knowledgeable clients spends much
oe = of his life in France. He drank ‘Simplet’ there every day. He told an importer
tnd at dex about it and the result was that the importer made it available to us — and we
ih St 5 offer it to you as possibly the best red wine of Bordeaux you can obtain for
el fepbeee day-in and day-out drinking.

SCHARZHOFBERGER TROCKENBEERENAUSLESE 1959 (Egon Muller)........... 135.00 _
We are even more astonished by this price than you are! Only 8 bottles exist in
the United States. This rare, nectar-like, dramatic white wine achieved the
highest price at auction in the history of Germany — not much below $100.00 on

the spot! Is it worth it? Is a Picasso worth $35,000.00? — we are now in a rarified
atmosphere and no one should buy this wine unless he has overwhelming
uriositv, an affluent bank account, and a wish to taste the best wine that
