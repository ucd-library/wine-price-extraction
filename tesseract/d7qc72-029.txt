UX NOW!

; ECONOMI
THEIR 1967 BORDE

  

WHY SHOULD
CLARET LOVERS BUY"

 

LET US EXAMINE THE FAGTS. Chateau Lafite Rothschild 1966 has risen on the Bordeaux
wholesale market place from $92.00 a case in 1967 to $145.00 the case when it was bottled
in the Fall of 1969. The probability is that this wine will command about $200 the case at
the consumer level during 1970.

The same ratio of increase will surely prevail in regard to the excellent 1967 clarets. They
are soft, quick-maturing, fruity, of superb bouquet, and with good life ahead of them.
Therefore, we genuinely believe it would be wise of you indeed, to purchase your ’67s
now and have them delivered to you, or to a warehouse of your choice, during mid 1970,

after their arrival from France.

Why are the great wines of Bordeaux, of the top flight vintage years, moving up so drama-
tically? Remember—there is an ever increasing world demand competing against fixed pro-
duction; added affluence throughout the Western world; world travel; more leisure; and
increased popularization through books, magazines, wine tastings, radio and television.

It is now obvious that the value of good wine increases in value per annum at a faster rate
than interest; hence a good investment. ‘Adam Smith,’ in his economic articles, points out

that you can always liquidate your wine investment by drinking it—a good hedge.

But above all, we must remember that ‘66s are approaching a price stratosphere—that, 1968
was only average in quality and low in production; the 1969s will prove outstanding, but
the vintage is cursed by a total production that does not exceed much more than 50% of an
average vintage. As we go to press, rumors reach us from Bordeaux that Lafite and Mouton
Rothschild 1969 will be offered for almost $100 the case to the prime buyers of Bordeaux,
such as Cruse, Calvet, etc. Imagine the prices that these 1969s will ultimately command on
the consumer level!

In summary. we can think of no significant evidence that should discourage the lover of
great claret from buying his 1967s now for several years ahead—provided he has the eco-
nomic resources, the space in his cellar, or the willingness to simply store the wines, in his
name, in a reliable public warehouse.
