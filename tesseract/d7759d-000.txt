Romance demanded, a year ago, a Champagne par
excellence. Pommery & Greno accepted the
Challenge and produced a vinous gem - chosen
from the most treasured bottles of their cellars -

Reserve Rainier III Brut. Bottled with loving care,

this full flavored, perfectly balanced and bone dry
wine delighted all who attended the fairy-tale
wedding, in Monaco, between Prince Rainier III
and Grace Kelly. We have fortunately acquired the
last remaining cases, which we proudly offer to
discriminating Champagne drinkers.

In a recent blind tasting among three wine
experts, Reserve Rainier achieved more

votes than any of its competitors, which
included several world-famous Champagnes
that sell at considerably higher levels.
Undoubtedly, this is the most unusual
Opportunity to acquire outstanding Champagne
at modest cost that has been offered the New
York public in years.
