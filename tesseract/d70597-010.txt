1962 CHATEAU BOTTLED

Quick to mature, the excellent 1962 clarets are appreciated by
connoisseurs because they carry their full quota of complete-
ness to the wine-drinker who wants to enjoy a great wine
today, and not a decade hence. Few ’62s can be found in Bor-
deaux today, because they have been spoken for by apprecia-
tive wine-drinkers throughout the world.

No. Bottle Case

213° CHATEAU TE Pee Fi ae. 3.99 43.10
At this price, it is a ‘find.’ St. Estephe.

244 CHATEAU CLA POURTE! ... 3? 4.99 53.90

Here is Grand Cru St. Emilion rich in bottle age. It is the
kind of full-flavored wine that will delight you.

’62 Gloria is a glory.

182.. CHATEAU PUGEAG ooo oss 7.99 86.30
The orchestration of a great St. Emilion is expressed
here.

115 CHATEAU COS D’ESTOURNEL ........ 9.95 107.45

None of this St. Estephe can be found in Bordeaux—
however there are still about 20 cases in our cellars.

121 CHATEAU GRUAUD LAROSE .......... 10.00 108.00
Astonishingly fine example of St. Julien.
188.. CHATEAU TALBOT oo ogck; ep 4 10.00 108.00

St. Julien. Same proprietor as Gruaud Larose. Which is
better? Suggest you buy a bottle of each and compare.

238 CHATEAU HAUT BRIN 2.3. cicsos sos 19.95 215.45
Great, Great. Down to our last few cases.

1961 CHATEAU BOTTLED

Our grandchildren will speak of the 1961 vintage as among the

immortals. Nothing would please us more than to give you a

greater selection, but alas, we are down to an offering of only

5 wines, and on a trade level, none can be found in Bordeaux.

We suspect that the last 2 wines listed here, as curiosities, will

command $100 the bottle in the reasonably near future.

239 CHATEAU CALOR 2. 16... 4.99 53.90
Not of royalty, but the excellence of the year compen-
sates for its bourgeois background. If you do not insist
upon a famed label but want superb wine, here is one
that should not be ignored.

570 CHATEAU FOURCAS-HOSTEIN ........ 6.49 70.10
Attention should be paid here. Here is a superb Chateau-
bottled Medoc of the great 1961. The excellence of the
vintage is expressed beautifully—with many good years

ahead.

161 CHATEAU AUSONE 2 ow. ise: ee, 19.95 215.45
A great St. Emilion. Irreplaceable.

208 CHATEAU LATOUR 2.255. 45-262 54.50 588.60

André Simon, prior to his recent death, was asked to
pick the wine that should be served to celebrate his
100th birthday seven years hence. He picked Chateau
Latour 1961.

203 CHATEAU LAFITE ROTHSCHILD ...... 68.60 740.95
Is a great work of art worth an astronomic sum? Is this
staggeringly great Lafite Rothschild worth $740.95 the
case? The answer is personal—each wine enthusiast must
make his own decision.

1959 CHATEAU BOTTLED

1959 was hailed as the “vintage of the century.” With the pas-

sage of time, we think ’61 and ’70 may have surpassed this

highly publicized year. Those that survive are glorious, ex-
tremely expensive, and will excite wine-lovers everywhere.

We do not have many of them to offer and we list them below.

178 CHATEAU BOUSCAUT >. +. <2... <s.« 8.95 96.65
Of noble Gaves heritage. Enjoy it now—or put it away
for a few years for added taste dividend.

127 CHATEAU HAUT BRION ........------: 49.50 534.60
So little remains that we fear that all will be gone before
the summer.

756 CHATEAU LATOUR ...........--+--->-> 49.50 534.60
Like Shakespeare’s Cleopatra, this remarkable ’59 can
state, “I have immortal longings within me.” There are
some who claim that this wine will outlive our grand-
children.

423 CHATEAU LAFITE ROTHSCHILD ...... 79.50 858.60
Will add its own touch of distinction to even the most

glorious cellar.

1955 CHATEAU BOTTLED

Superb! With 15 years of development in bottle, these wines
will bring the rewards of patient maturation to appreciative
wine-drinkers. The depth and balance are impeccable.

greatest reward for those who choose to wait.
CHATEAU LATOUR: 2.:-- >... 54.50 588.60
Chateau Latour 1955 was the favorite red wine of Charles
de Gaulle. Need we say more?
CHATEAU MOUTON ROTHSCHILD ....65.00 702.00
A jewel in the crown of Bordeaux. It is the kind of
wine that reaches astronomic figures at London’s wine
auctions.

1952 CHATEAU BOTTLED

During the early life of the ’52s, they contained an excess of
tannin which obscured the fruit. This has changed—they are
now coming into their own, can be enjoyed now with a long,
long life ahead.

quantity.
