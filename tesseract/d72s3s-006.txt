1969 RED BORDEAUX

 

 

Bottle Case
CHATEAU PICQUE CAILLOU (Graves) 2.99 35.50
Wonderful low cost Graves.
CHATEAU BOUSCAUT (Graves) 5.49 62.60
American-owned, Bouscaut always makes a fine bottle of
claret. This delicious 1969 is no exception.
CHATEAU HAUT BRION (Graves) 8.79 99.95
A first growth from a good year at less than $10? Yes!
Order quickly before our supply is exhausted.
CHATEAU CHEVAL BLANC (St. Emilion) 10.95 124.85
The best wine of St. Emilion at one of the lowest prices
we have seen recently.
CHATEAU LATOUR (Pauillac) 11.95 136.25
The lordly wines of Latour - one of the Princes of Pauillac -
usually command much more than this. Will soon show its
greatness to those wise enough to acquire a case now.
1967 RED BORDEAUX
Bottle Case

CHATEAU LANGOA BARTON (St. Julien) 5.49 62.60
Langoa Barton, one of several eminent 'Grand Cru' chateaux
in St. Julien, is not as well known in this country as some of
its neighbors. It should be - for by any standard, this chateau
consistently produces great wine. 1967 has often been praised
by wine authorities as 'the ideal Bordeaux vintage for present
drinking.' In this case, we heartily agree. Langoa Barton
1967 is mature - and magnificently so: fine bouquet and body,
good balance of tannin and fruit. The surprising end of our tale
is that the price is so affordable. Order early to avoid missing
this lovely wine.

CHATEAU LEOVILLE BARTON (St. Julien) 5.99 68.30

    

Another fine St. Julien. Ready now - ata
very good price. Our tasting notes read -
£ "Superb, beautifully balanced; everything
: that a good claret should bes" A Grand Cru
that is showing better than its chief rival -
Léoville Las Cases.
