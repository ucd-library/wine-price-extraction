the weather is particularly favorable in
August and September and during the
oathering, that we might still be dealing
sudth a very good vear. Everyone | speak
to in Paris about this has his fingers

crossed and hopes nature will surprise us

 

The Bordeaux wine merchants tell me
that the 1961’s are the best red wines pro-
duced since 1945, and some even com
pare them to 1900. They speak of “enor
mous color, body, purity in character,
great firmness without excess tannin, real
character without superficial charm, and
hopelessly high prices for these great
treasures.” However, it should be pointed
out that in some instances the 1959s are
superior to the 1901's, in Mouton Roth-
schild, Montrose, Leoville Lascases, Leo-
ville Poyferre, and quite a few others. The
trick is to pick wisely by consulting with
a well intormed wine merchant who can
help you choose between the beauty of

one year and the virtue of the other

Those of my friends in Bordeaux who

have an eye on the cost, and who drink
Claret on a daily basis, are now looking
to the 1960, which has been rather ig-
nored because it had the poor fortune to
tall between two great years. These much
neglected 1960's will be in the bottle this
fall. Starting to show every sign of going
up 1n price as the demand starts, and
surely will delight the knowing wine
drinker who is more interested in wha
is in the bottle than the v intage year that
appears on the label. I should warn you

that

careful selection will be required
here and those that I know are good, be-
cause I have tasted them several times
are Haut Brion, Latour, Lafite, Cos d’Es
tournel and Be yc he velle

As for the legendary 1959’s, the original
promise of their greatness has been lived
up to. Many of them have completed their
voyage to the United States just about the
time that I am w riting this. Because of
the hysterical world demand. they are ex

tremely scarce in Bordeaux and command

Prices that are astonishing. I think the

great discove ry among them. because |
genuinely believe it can stand up to many
first growths, is Leoville Lascases—and
surely one of the great wines of our life

time is Haut Brion 1959

REPORT FROM BURGUNDY

[he vigneron in Burgundy frowns when
you mention 1962 because it got off to

rather an unsatisfactory start due to cold

weather, and loss of grapes due to coulure,

|

but such dismal prophesies about the new
vintage should not be taken too seriously

at this time. It is still a bit too early to te I]

However, the grower’s face lights up

Ly
when you mention “1961.” The most elo
quent testimony as to the greatness of this
year was supplied last November at the
Hospices de Be aune auction, where nevet
in the history of France have red wines
commanded such astronomic prices. They
rather resemble the 1953’s, perhaps a lit
tle fuller, but with the same delicacy of
flavor and distinction of breed. The 1961
Beaujolais is a bit firmer and heavier than
average, with delightful fruit and depth,
all in all, I have tasted here in Paris
some of the best Beaujolais I have ever

1

encountered. I believe She frrys 1s now
getting some of the 196] Beaujolais
and my advice to you is to get it while it
is still young and by all means drink it
this summer—especially the Fleurie and

the Moulin a’ Vent

DINING AL FRESCO
It is altogether fitting that I should be
writing about picnics after a most pleas-
ant lunch at the Pre-Catalan Restaurant
surounded by the beautiful foliage of the
Bois de Boulogne. It is Saturday and |
have seen the picque-nicque baskets
everywhere—on buses, along the Champs
Elysees, in automobiles and 1f} the Bois
Picnics are universally loved, and can be

i

quite as delightful in America as they are

along the banks of the Seine.

Everyones appetite is at its heartiest

point after a brisk walk and in the out-
