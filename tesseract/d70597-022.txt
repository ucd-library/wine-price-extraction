PIAT IN POT (Macon) .<............ 2, 1.99 22.00

In his vineyards that dot the Maconnais
countryside, Charles Piat produces this
wine. He is sufficiently proud of it to put
his name on it prominently and bottle it
in the unique and distinctive Pot bottle,
which has been associated with the Piat
family since 1849. Rather like a Beaujolais
—fruity, light, serve slightly cool.

STONE’S GINGER WINE (England) ...... 1.99 22.00
Made in England since 1740 from luscious English cur-
rants spiced with Jamaican green ginger. Usually con-
sumed after dinner over ice cubes. In England, it is a
popular as a ‘pick-me-up’ after a day outdoors.

VELTLINSKE ZELENE

(Czechoslovalial | 2. << cscs ees 5 2.25 24.50
Viniculture is an ancient craft among the Czechs. This is
the dry white wine that is consumed copiously in Prague
and the taverns that dot the countryside.

SAKE RICE WINE (Japan) .............. 2.29 24.75
The traditional accompaniment to dining in Japan. Serve
ice cold or warm—dependent on the weather or your
mood.

CABERNET SAUVIGNON (Israel) ....... 2.35 25.80
The first vineyards of Israel were planted under the
patronage of Baron Edmond de Rothschild in 1882. Rela-
tively recently, an important wine experiment took place
when Cabernet Sauvignon, the grape of Bordeaux, was
planted. Here is far and away the best red wine of Israel.

SAN FELIPE RED or WHITE (Argentina).. 2.49 27.40
Argentina is the largest wine producing country in South
America, and is only topped in production by France,
Italy and Spain. Here is their best wine—you have a
choice of red or white.

AUXERROIS 1969 (Luxembourg) ........ 2.50 27.00

grape variety, is produced.

In America they ask for ‘Cold
Duck’; in Spain, -‘Pato Frio’ is
starting to take hold. It is a blend
of red and white crackling wine
produced in the Rioja area. If you
like ‘Cold Duck,’ you will love
this one.

BURGUNDY 1969 (Australia) ............ 2.69 30.66
The vineyards of Australia are the
same distance south of the equator
as the Napa Valley is north of the
equator. Both of these temperate
areas produce excellent wines. This
Chalambar 1969 Burgundy from the
Seppelt vineyards, is the best Aus-
tralian red wine we have ever
tasted. Full bodied, interesting,
worth trying.

RIESLING TARNAVE (Rumania) ........ 2.79 30.25
The Riesling grape flourishes in the foothills of the Car-
pathians. Dry, clean, intriguing.

BLACKBERRY JULEP (Italy) ............ 2.79 30.25
If you like the taste of fruity, sweet blackberries, you
will like this.

Holland is not noted for its grapes, but for its berries and
fruit. Here is a delicious deviation from the norm. A
true ‘fun’ wine.

SANT’ GRIA IN MAGNUM (Spain) ...... 3.49 18.85

Case

of 6
A bottle of Sangria is consumed so rapidly that it is
hardly enough. Hence, we recommend it be obtained in
the impressive MAGNUM size—your guests will be de-
lighted with your generosity, it will not require opening
so many bottles. And there is a savings over the bottle
size which costs $1.79. Almost one million cases was sold
in the U.S. last year, and its popularity indicates that a
million cases will be passed next year. It is made from
rich Spanish red wine, premixed with the juices of the

oranges, lemons and limes of Spain.
1323 ARCHBISHOP’S MEAD (England) ....... 3.49 39.75

King Alfred is reputed to be the founder of Oxford Uni-
versity and his drink was Mead. This one bears the label
of St. Edmund Hall in the University of Oxford, and is
made of raisins and honey—rather like a first cousin to a
sweet Sauternes. Interesting, excellent.

Here attention must be paid. Normally,
Cassis commands about $8 the bottle.
This one is lower in alcohol, but there
is no loss in concentration of flavor.
Add it to white wine for a delicious
‘Kir.’ It will also embellish ice cream,
ices, or any fruit dessert. We think no
bar or kitchen is complete without at
—— least one bottle on hand.

BOYER BRUT 1969 (Sparkling wine—

Vrauee). soe a kt es 3.99 43.10
The Champagne makers of France move from the Cham-
pagne district to the French Alps, bringing their skills
with them. Here they produce a sparkling wine of dry-
ness and excellence that is not readily distinguishable
from the good sparkling wines of the Champagne area.
Perfect for receptions, before dinner as an aperitif—or
anywhere you would like to serve Champagne but are
not prepared to pay double this price. Skeptical? Try it.
HAMBLETON WHITE 1969 (England) .... 3.99 43.10
We quote the Paris Herald-Tribune, “It would take a re-
tired British Major General to dream of planting vines
and making wine in England. Maj. Gen. Sir Guy Salisbury-
Jones was the British Military Attaché in Paris from
1946-49.” He has succeeded well because this noble prod-
uct of British soil, rich in elegance and finesse, has the
grace of a good Moselle.
