These interesting deviations from the beaten path can add interest and excitement to
your drinking and dining this summer . . . Ever try the popular summer drink of
the British Empire, Pimm’s No. 1 Cup mixed with lemon soda? Or really ice cold
Swedish Aquavit as an accompaniment to the cold Hors d’Oeuvre? .. . And let us not
overlook the delightful Creme de Cassis; simply mix it in a pitcher with dry Vermouth,
soda, lemon peel and plenty of ice. It tastes as good as it looks... Amer Picon and
soda with a twist of lemon peel is a summer favorite in Paris . . . Nor should vou
neglect the wonderful flavor that good Swiss Kirsch can add to your summer fruit
cups ... And we certainly should not forget the wonderful coolness of appearance
and taste that a good Green Menthe served frappe can impart ... And now let us
be off to a gay and festive summer!
