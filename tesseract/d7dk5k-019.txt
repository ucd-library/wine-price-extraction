full maturity until they found
a blend to delight even their most

The blessedness of being a brandy

enthusiast—an experience which
often surprises and delights those
who imagine they have no taste
for it—is well within most peo-
ple’s pockets by virtue of Fort-
num & Mason’s Fine Cham-
pagne Cognac, an unique exam-
ple of delicate good taste, dry-
ness and bouquet. We at Sherry’s
present this superb English
Market cognac at $6.49 the bot-
tle, ($75.00 the case) knowing
that you will find its subtle ap-
peal irresistible.

THE GOODNESS THAT
IS LONDON GIN
‘Victoriana’ passed on one good
deed not condemned by the Eliz-
abethian of 1957, gin made in
the best British manner. Fort-
num & Mason continue the tra-
dition with their exceptionally
fine dry London Gin. The ‘bur-
ial’ of Martinis ruined by a
poor gin probably accounts for
more bad temper and_ broken
friendships than any other cock-
tail. A good Martini should
have only the finest gin obtain-
able as its primary ingredient, so
at Sherry’s we recommend this
relatively inexpensive imported
gin at only $4.79 the bottle
($54.95 the case). Whichever
way you take your gin — this is
the pure, smooth basis for all
your mixtures—it just can’t

help making friends.

SHERRY—AT ALL TIMES

Fortnum & Mason’s Fino, a
traditional aperitif wine of Eng-
land at $2.99 the bottle ($34.75

the case) and their flawless

Amontillado, rich, fine, carefully
selected and well-aged at $3.49
a bottle ($39.75 the case) are
two of the greatest sherries to
be found at Sherry’s.

THE WINES BEING EXAMINED IN THE PRESENCE
OF FRENCH GOVERNMENTAL OFFICIALS

RARE OLD WINES FROM A
PRE-WAR BURGUNDY CELLAR

We launch the Holiday Season with two proud
offerings from the most remarkable collection of authentic
Estate-bottled red Burgundies of pre-war vintage that can be
found in France. This event has only been made possible by
the determined effort of M. Doudet-Naudin, impeccable vine-
yard owner, who concealed some of his liquid assets just
before the German army arrived back in 1942. He, like many
another Frenchman, walled up the cream of the great Bur-
gundies that were in his cellars in a camouflaged cistern.

At long last, in the summer of 1955, in the pres-
ence of the French Tax authorities, it was opened. The wine
had been away from all light, air and vibration for 13 years—
“preserved like sleeping beauties.” Sample bottles were
opened, the wine proved wholly extraor-
dinary; such a collection of rare old vin-
tages cannot be duplicated anywhere
in Burgundy. To make doubly sure, the
cork of each bottle was drawn, the wine
carefully checked and a new branded cork
put into each bottle.
