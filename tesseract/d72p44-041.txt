A NOBLE HOLIDAY DUET

Your choice of

BENEDICTINE or ‘B and B’

The cry of ‘Eureka’ filled the air about the year
4510 at a Benedictine monastery in Fécamp,
France. It was during that period that Dom
Bernardo Vincelli discovered the secret of
making ‘Benedictine’ which was designed to
fortify and restore the spirits of the weary
monks. Shortly thereafter, this delicious
liqueur found favor with Francis | who discov-
ered it when he passed through the region in
1534.

During the 19th Century, the formula fell into
the hands of Monsieur Alexandre Le Grand
and his family have since been trusted to pre-
serve the formula. The ecclesiastical inscrip-
tion D.O.M., which means ‘Deo Optimo
Maximo’ still is carried on every bottle of both
‘Benedictine’ and ‘B and B’.

Note the delightful holiday wrapping. Historic-
ally and symbolically most suitable as a
Christmas gift.
