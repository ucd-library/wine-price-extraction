Let us examine the facts.

The size of the great vineyards of Bordeaux are fixed by
nature and law, and yet they must contend with an ever-
increasing world demand, stimulated by world travel,
added affluence, more leisure, and increased populari-
zation via books, magazines, radio and television. Proof
of this is that Chateau Lafite Rothschild 1959 has dra-
matically moved from $48 the case in 1960 to almost $300
the case today! We also know that 1968 was a relatively
dismal vintage in Bordeaux and the prices of the '66s and
"67s that remain on the Bordeaux market have gone up 10%
to 20% during the last few months.

An objective evaluation of the two vintage years, 1966
and 1967, in red Bordeaux was recently provided in the
new Time-Life book "Wines & Spirits"—here, we quote
directly from the book.

Chateau LOLSEAU (Bordeaux Superieur) ...........

RED BORDEAUX

NOW?

1966—The Chateau owners were happy as they gathered this
great vintage; they were able to obtain the highest
prices for claret in Bordeaux wine history. A bit less
body than the '64s, but compensated for by unusual bou-
quet, better balance, and a remarkable similarity to the
extraordinary '53s, as well as sufficient tannin to pro-
vide the backbone for exceptional longevity. Recon-
mended for laying down in private wine cellars.

1967—The crop was most beneficial to the wine drinker
because it was exceptionally large, above average in
quality, and produced a soft, quick-maturing, fruity
wine with a fine bouquet. This most useful, satisfying
vintage can be consumed joyously while we wait for the
Slower maturing '6ls and '66s to come to their full
fruition.

A 'sleeper'. From an excellent Medoc vineyard owned by

Georges Hereil, President of Simca.

Perin UAeoAULT (ote Emilion) ..............-...

Favored vineyard owned by Marcel Dassault, famed creator of the

Mirage-Mystere, and Falcon Jet. Our tasting notes read,

"astonishing—big, fat, outstanding St. Emilion—obviously good

for another decade".

Catena GATOUR CARNET (Medoec)..............: a

Ranked in the 1855 classification on the same level as Beychevelle,
Talbot, and Duhart-Milon. Since its small size did not permit

world-publicity, it is therefore a "best buy'.

Restaurants of Paris and New York have used up the 1964.

Now is the time to get the excellent '66s all ready—tright away.

CHATEAU PRIEURE-LICHINE (Margaux) ..............

We quote Cyril Ray in the London Observer, "Chateau Bouscaut is a
fine, full-bodied, yet far from heavy wine...typical of red Graves in

developing more quickly than a comparable Medoc yet lasting as long".
