Bachelet-kamonet
In the great Burgundian tradition, the
entire Bachelet family helps vineyard
owner Jean (at left, wearing cap) dur-
ing the vendange. Monsieur Bachelet
is considered something of a “boy
wonder” in the region, for though not
yet 31, he has holdings in six vine-
yards in which he produces red and
white Burgundy of enormous virtue
and beauty.

WHITES _

ct
Pierre Matrot
We have come to expect excellent
white wines from the famous Meur-
sault vineyard and exemplary modern
cellars of M. Matrot. Our expecta-
tions were more than justified when
we tasted through his caves: his 1964s
already possess fruit, style — and a
promise of greatness to come.

Domaine Joseph
Matrot

Since the death of Joseph Matrot two
years ago, the wines of this respected
domaine have been vinified by his son,
Pierre, with obvious diligence. An
almost perfect growing season has
created here almost ideal white wines
with a special tang that identifies them
as amongst the best to bear the Meur-
sault appellation.

LEHMANN'S
FINE BURGUNDY
VARIETALS

To find authentic red and white Bur-
gundies of good quality but modest
price is difficult. Our success can be
judged by this trio of lovely special
bottlings, the result of many tastings
throughout the region. For greater
convenience, we have chosen to call
these excellent 1964s by their grape
varietal names.

Thus, the classic red wine grape that
produces fabulous red Burgundies
like Chambertin and Volnay, makes
our Lehmann Pinot Noir. Our white
Pinot Chardonnay shares the same
delicate dryness as a Pouilly-Fuissé.
The fruit and elegance of Beaujolais’
Gamay grape can be enjoyed in our
modestly priced Lehmann Gamay,
grown close to Fleurie and St. Amour.

BEAUJOLAIS

It is perhaps a mistake to think of
Beaujolais as a Burgundy. The
Gamay grape, scorned in the great
vineyards of the Cote d’Or, comes
into its own in the rolling hills and
granite soil of Beaujolais. The result
is a tender wine, concededly modest,
without aristocratic pretensions, and
consequently always a welcome table
companion.

Edmond Laneyrie

Perhaps no producer in all the region
is more skillful in capturing in the
bottle so much of the fruit that makes
a fine Beaujolais. A distinguished rep-
resentative of the French government
for his area, Monsieur Laneyrie is
especially delighted with his supple
1964 Julienas which will be one of
the first estate-bottlings of the year to
arrive in our cellars.

Rene Bernard

A pleasure to the eye is the elegant
Chateau of René Bernard. A joy to
the palate are the Beaujolais we chose
there, tasting with the proprietor.
From amongst several cuvées we
picked this fruitier, more elegant and
rapidly maturing red — Chateau de
Correaux. Another delicious dis-
covery: Beaujolais Blanc (yes, white!)

—heretofore little known outside
France and never available in quan-
tity. It resembles a Pouilly-Fuissé and
should be served with any food for
which a white Burgundy is appro-
priate.

Beaujolais
Cooperatives

More and more of the smaller pro-
ducers in Beaujolais are using the su-
perior facilities of cooperative cellars
for the making of their wines. From
the extensive production of the 18
cooperatives in Beaujolais, we re-
served the best of several fine cuvées
at St. Etienne des Oullieres especially
for this offering. These include four
favorites:

LOIRE

Along the banks of the Loire River
are made two charming dry white
wines, current favorites in Paris and
now enjoying much popularity here.
The Pouilly-sur-Loire made from the
Chasselas grape is mild in flavor, soft
and fragrant. The Pouilly-Fumé has
great fruit and elegance because of
the classic Sauvignon grape (famous
in Bordeaux) from which it is made,
Georges Gaudry who made these
wines instructs us that they should be
drunk as in France, on arrival.
