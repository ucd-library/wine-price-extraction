The Sherry-Lehmann
‘Chateau Wine Rack’ $9495

Creates a ‘Wine Library’ in your home

Here is the perfect answer to where you can store your wines so they are conveniently
accessible—and attractively displayed. Made of handsome, dark hardwoods, with black iron
braces, this wine rack has been available exclusively at the notable Madison Avenue wine shop, Sherry-Lehmann. But now this useful and
decorative modular unit is being offered to wine lovers everywhere. The Sherry-Lehmann ‘Chateau Wine Rack’ has been duplicated

many times—with lighter, less-durable woods and galvanized-steel braces—but none has been as sturdy or as handsome as the wine
library rack we offer here.

The Sherry-Lehmann ‘Chateau Wine Rack’ is easy to assemble. It measures 1234" x 164" x 9” deep, and can stand either horizon-
tally or vertically, as best suits your available space. By itself, it holds up to sixteen bottles. However, the beauty of the ‘Chateau Wine Rack’
is in its ability to be stacked ‘ad infinitum to create a veritable ‘wine library’ holding as many bottles as you wish. Create an entire wall of
vineal delights—or, if cautious, order a few racks now, and reorder in the future when your cellar needs expand. Here is a versatile method
to keep your bottles properly cradled while adding prestige, beauty and drama to your living space.

Note: Specially designed wood-strip “spacers” are necessary to assure the sturdiness of stacking one wine rack atop another.
Two “spacers” —one placed on each upper corner—are needed before the next wine rack can be firmly positioned on top.

spacers $1.95, set of two
