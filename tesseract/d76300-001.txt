SWISS NEUCHATEL 1953 ee.
Estate Bottled, City of Neuchatel .  . . . ‘Coumed 1.29 14.50

Neuchatel, particularly with the advent of spring, has consistently been one of the most delightful, delicate, sprightly
and most popular of white wines. Here is an authentic thoroughbred, estate bottled at a vineyard which is
proudly owned and maintained by the City of Neuchatel. Most Neuchatel on the market sells for over $2.00 the
bottle — we have compared them to this one and can categorically state that this is the best of the lot. A mag-

nificent companion for warm weather menus.

GERMAN MAY WINE (Gebrueder Lob) . . . . . (I.79 1.29 14.50

One of the most provocative aromas in the garden during the spring is one which few people associate with
drinking. They inhale the fresh, tingling aroma of the woodruff plant, but never quite associate it with the bouquet
of “May Wine.” This one has just reached us from the Rhine — we opened a bottle and were intrigued by the
garden-fresh tang which greeted us, the smell of woodruff. We happily inform you that it costs but $1.29 —a
delightful and inexpensive wine to serve chilled as an aperitif during the coming warm days.

WURZBURGER LINDLINSBERG 1953
Estate Bottled, the Julius Spital . . . . . . 2.49 1.99 22.65

Wurzburg, an important city of Franconia, is quite as famous for its wine as for its beer. Its wines are bottled
in the attractive, squat green flagons called Bocksbeutel, generally known as Steinwein. The best wine of the area
is estate bottled by the Julius Spital, a celebrated charity hospital in the heart of the historic city of Wurzburg.
As far as we can judge, this marks the first time that this supreme example of Franconian wine has been made
available to the New York public. We suggest you try a bottle or two at this low cost.

ALSATIAN RIESLING 1952 (Caves Hanhart) . — Value Continued 1.29 14.50

Riesling is one of the two greatest of all white wine grapes and particularly thrives among the steep hills of Alsace,
where it produces a dry wine of unusual charm. Here is an excellent example at a price that will permit serving
freely this summer.

GEWURZTRAMINER 1952 (Caves Hanhart) .  . Value Continued 1.49 16.95

The most highly regarded grape of the district is the Gewurztraminer which yields a wine not quite as dry as the
Riesling, but with a bouquet that is more prominent and more highly perfumed. This wine would be an excep-
tional value at $2.00.

FLEUR D’ALSACE (F. Hugel) ee ee ee 1.69 18.29

Here is a wine that is aptly named “Flower of Alsace’ — made by F. Hugel, the most famed of the Alsatian
growers, it has all of the freshness, youth and flowery charm associated with the delightful wines of Alsace. A
perfect choice for “spritzers,” terrace-dining, and picnic lunches. Also available in half bottles at 99c each,
$21.69 the case.

GEWURZTRAMINER GRAND CRU 1953 (F. Hugel) New 2.89 31.13

We herald this remarkable Alsatian wine as the best single example of white wine we have ever tasted from the
district. An extraordinary 1953 that can rank with the great vineyards of the Rheingau. Enthusiastically recom-

mended for those who want superb Alsatian wine — you will be amazed by its stature and breed. Half bottles at
$1.59 each, $34.51 the case.
