No. Bottle Case
5000 REGENT COTES DE BERGERAC.....-- 1.29 13.95
Medium dry white, grown 80 miles east of Bordeaux.

520  CORBIERES CHAINTRUEL 1966.....-- 1.49 16.10
An excellent red from the rolling hills of Carcassonne.

847 SCIATINO ROUGE 1966 (Corsica) ..--- 1.49 16.10

 

The Corsicans say, this was the preferred wine of the island’s famous son,
Napoleon Bonaparte. This red is similar to a Cote-du-Rhone and represents good

value.
805 CHATEAU ROUBAUD ROUGE 9067; :: . LD? 19.35

Grown in the Costieres du Gard, just west of Arles. It is best drunk young, while
its freshness is still attractively clear.

808 CAHORS ROUGE 1966....-++-++-+-: ., 2.19 23.65

Interesting legendary red wine grown north of Toulouse. Dark crimson in color,
long-lived, similar to a full-bodied red wine of Graves.

765  APREMONT 1967 (Savoie)..-+++-++++> 2.29 24.75
Apremont in the French Alps is the equivalent of ‘Apré-Ski.’ It is a wine that no
expert skier would be without. Seyssel and Crepy are also popular, but Apremont
is undoubtedly the best. Crisp, clear—and from vineyards overlooking the cherry
orchards of the broad Isére Valley. There is often a slight petillance in the wine
which adds to its charm.

581 CREPY 1967 (Savoie) ..---+++seee 2° 2.79 30.15
Whether you ski at Megeve, Courchevel, Chamonix, or Val d’Isére, you will un-
doubtedly be drinking Crepy—the fresh, dry, invigorating, crisp mountain wine
grown in the Alps.

807 BANDOL ROUGE 1964...-+-++++2e2% 3.49 37.70
The vineyards are terraced on the hills behind the Bandol fishing port. The red
is elegant, often matures quickly, but ages well. Because of its good balance, it
keeps in bottle for 10 years or more, ultimately developing a delicious bouquet
of ripe pears.

782 BOUZY ROUGE 1966 (Champagne) 4.99 53.90
Extraordinary red wine made from the Pinot Noir grape on Champagne soil.
Favored in Paris—first importation into United States.

when young.

473 CHIANTI RISERVA, DUCALE....--+-- . 3.95 42.66

THE WHITE WINES OF ITALY...
506  FRASCATI (Campo Romano) ..-.+++>:> 1.19 12.85

Grown in the Alban hills, southeast of Rome. The wine featured in the Trattorias
of Rome. Dry, golden, agreeable but hardly distinguished.

5023 VERDICCHIO (Or. Fe. Vi.) . +++ e+e 1.89 20.41
Grown in the foothills of the Apennines. One of the lightest, most popular, and
best white table wines of Italy. Now becoming internationally famous.

494 CORVO DUCA DI SALAPARUTA.....-- 1.90 20.52

The best dry white table wine of Sicily. Grown just east of Palermo on the estate
of the Duca di Salaparuta.

438  ORVIETO DRY (Bigi) in wicker ..-.-- > 2.35 25.38
Grown in famed cathedral town. Vineyards are intermixed with potato patches,
married to trees or strung along pergolas. Interesting visually to observe the
impromptu carefree plantings.

579 SOAVE 1966 (Cantina Sociale) .-++-+>+-> 1.99 21.50
In our opinion, the best single dry white wine of all Italy. Pale straw in color,
light, fresh, without excessive acidity.

FROM THE LOIRE VALLEY...

No. Bottle Case

697 MUSCADET, SEVRE ET MAINE, 1968... 1.69 18.25
Only an important wine merchant such as Nicolas of Paris could have done it!
A genuinely fine Muscadet at a price below what you pay for the wine in a
Parisian bistro. Dry, clean, fresh.

987 MONTLOUIS 1968 (Nicolas) .. +--+ +++ > 1.79 19.35
ane Vouvray directly across the Loire. Even experts cannot distinguish between
them.

391 CHAMPIGNY ROUGE 1966

(Caves de Saumur) ..- +--+ +seeeee8% 1.99 21.50
Champigny is a political wine; it was the favorite of Chemenceau and still sells
under the slogan “Le tigre en buvait aussi.”

5008 VOUVRAY 1961 (Nicolas) ..--+-+++e2% 1.99 21.50
The cry of “Ouvrez le Vouvray” is a splendid way of greeting the new year. White,
medium dry, fruity.

503 MUSCADET-SUR-LIE 1968
(Won Gold Medal at Paris Fair as best “
Muscadet produced during 1968) ..----> 1.99 21.50

We are proud. The Beaujolais Brouilly we represent won a Gold Award at the
Paris Fair, and—lo and behold !—the Muscadet we carry also won the Gold Award
in its category. Only 120 cases were produced and we got them all. This is not
ordinary Muscadet—it is ‘sur-lie’ which means that the wine was never racked,
but the precious liquid was taken from the barrel, slowly and carefully. This
assures maximum flavor, bouquet and richness. It is the kind of Muscadet that
you have probably never tasted before, and is surely better than any we have
ever encountered.

448 SANCERRE 1968 (Nicolas) ..-+++ +> 2.49 26.90
Across the Loire from Pouilly Fume. Dry, delicate, with much subtlety.
447 CHINON ROUGE 1967....--+++s+0% 2.49 26.90

The birthplace of Rabelais yields a light fresh red wine—best when young. Most
consumed locally.

741 QUINCY 1967 (R. Pipet). 2. - eee ees 2.59 27.95
“Quincy” is not a town in Massachusetts, but is one of the best wine growing
districts of the Loire. A dry white of much character.

710 BOURGUEIL ROUGE 1966....+-+++2s-> . 2.79 30.15
Not far from Chinon, can be found these soft, delicately perfumed, and ready-to-
drink red wines. Surprising power and not dissimilar, but fruitier than an excel-
lent red Bordeaux.

338 POUILLY BLANC FUME 1967 (Ladoucette). 4.09 44.68
If one were looking for the Montrachet of the Loire Valley, he would probably
find it here at the de Ladoucette vineyard. Excellent.
