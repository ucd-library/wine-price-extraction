THE WINES OF ITALY

Every province of Italy produces wine, totalling more than six times
as much as the U.S. produces. Most is ordinary, but there are some
beauties. If you want to take a wine trip through Italy, choose among

their best wines below.

ITALIAN RED WINES

Bottle Case

CHIANTI RISERVA 1966 1.99 21.50
Marchesi Corsini owns some of the best vineyard land of
Tuscany and this ‘Riserva’ is outstanding. Worth at least
81.00 the bottle more. Also available in Magnums at 4.96
each, 24.50 the case of 6.

LAMBRUSCO DI SORBARA 1.99 21.50
Unusual red wine produced just west of Bologna. Extremely

fruity, slightly sweet, with exceptional bouquet.

VALPOLICELLA 1967 2.19 23.65
Pleasing, fruity, light. Cantina Sociale.
BARDOLINO 1969 2.19 23.65

Frank Schoonmaker selected this refreshing, fruity, light
red wine grown along the shores of Lake Garda. Low price
for its outstanding quality.

BAROLO 1966 2.99 32.30
Here again, Frank Schoonmaker is proud of this discovery
which he founded among the hills of Piedmont. We share his
opinion that Barolo is perhaps the best red wine of all Italy;
full-bodied, slow-maturing and comparable to a top flight
Rhone Valley red. Generally kept at least three years in wood
and then put in ‘Burgundy’ bottles. Powerful, definitely be-
longs in the ranks of great red wines.

ITALIAN WHITE WINES

FRASCATI 1969... 1.79 19.35
While dining at the Grand Hotel in Rome, we were amazed
by the Frascati they served us—way beyond the class of any
other we experienced. The Grand Hotel Manager then told
us that it comes from the Valle Vermiglia vineyard, owned
by Pietro Campilli, now President of Italy’s National Eco-
nomic Council and until recently, President of Edison
Montecatini. Perhaps it was his devotion to excellence in
whatever field he may be engaged that permitted Mr.
Campilli ta produce this agreeable and refreshing white
wine.

CHIANTI BIANCO SECCO 1968 1.99 21.50
Marchesi Corsini, who has sent us his remarkable Chianti
Riserva listed above, has accompanied the shipment with
some of his excellent dry white, grown in Tuscany. Made
from the Trebbiano grape, it is dry, golden, and relatively
full bodied. The best of class—and priced remarkably low.
SOAVE 1967 2.19 23.65
Perhaps we are prejudiced, but we consider this the best
dry white wine of all Italy. Cantina Sociale.
ORVIETO DRY 2.479
From Umbria. In squat straw bottle. Dry, Ruffino.
VERDICCHIO 1966 2.29 24.73

Grown near Adriatic. In amphora bottle. Dry, very light,

30.14

pale, fresh. From the ‘Castelli di Jesi’? vineyards which sets
the standard for all other Verdicchios.

RAVELLO ROSA 2.49 27.49
Although not white, but rosé in color, we think this wine
is too good and too important to be excluded from among
the Italian wines. Some of you may have visited this delight-
ful little town of Ravello overlooking Amalfi and may have
eaten at the enchanting inn, owned by the brothers Caruso
who produce this colorful dry and utterly pleasant pink wine.

THE WINES OF CHILE

The history of wine making goes back to the mid 16th Century in

Chile and there are many wine critics who consider it the best of the

non-European wines. Below we offer only the best of Chile

wines

made from noble grape varieties and from the best sections of the

vinevard. You will find them astonishingly good

they bear little

resemblance to the pleasant, non-descript little Chilean wines that

have been

hipped to the United States up to now.

Bottle Case
CABERNET SAUVIGNON 1967 1.98 22.00
Here is the great grape of Bordeaux producing a full-flayored
red wine deep in color, long-lived, and capable of thriving
for another two decades.
PINOT NOIR 1966 1.98 22.00
‘Pinot Noir’ is the grape that produces the great red Bur-
gundies. It has flourished beautifully here in the soil of
Chile. Will match red Burgundies that sell between $3.00
and $3.50 the bottle.
PINOT BLANC 1966 1.98 22.00
The white wine grape that provides the basis for many white
Burgundies. Finesse, dryness and character are the character-
istics here.

THE WINES OF PORTUGAL
We think of Portugal in terms of port wine, but in truth, over 90%

produced is table wine. Some of the world’s best selling wines, such
as Lancers and Mateus, come from Portugal. The best white is Vinho

\ erde

and the best red is Dao.

RED WINES

1143 DAO CABIDO 1.99 21.50

bodied, heavy and fruity.

Considered the best single example of Dao.

Similar to a white Bordeaux from Graves.

Called ‘green’ because it should be drunk young. Dry.
Lagosta.
