BEEFEATER GIN

Rarely has any spirit cap-
tured the enthusiasm of
the American public as
has BEEFEATER ENG-
LISH GIN. Only two dec-
ades ago, the name was
primarily associated with
a beautifully uniformed
Quard protecting the
Tower of London and
other historic monu-
ments. Now, should you
stop the nearest passer-
by and ask him the
meaning of ‘Beefeater’,
he will respond with ‘the
best gin in the world’. We
suspect future dictionar-
ies will record this fact.
If you have a friend who
likes gin, can you think
of a better gift to send
him than a few bottles of
BEEFEATER?

The characteristics are
unique. Deep in flavor,
elegant, remarkable
bouquet and perfect bal- ,
ance. The Champagne is >
called ‘CERTIFICATE’ be-
cause the House of Char-
baut follows the custom of
sending a hand-written,
numbered certificate to
those who acquire the
Champagne.
