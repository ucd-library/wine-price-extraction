NOW SIX YEARS OLD! — a remarkable Kentucky Bourbon at irresistibly low sale cost. Produced by one of Kentucky’s
finest distilleries and matured a full six years in barrel. It has consistently been one of our best Bourbon sellers at $3.89.
At this new low price, it will permit you to serve fine Bourbon drinks this season at substantial savings. 86 proof. Full
quarts at $4.55, the case of 12 only $53.50.

CPt Ro a a 3.49 40.95

New York’s most outstanding blended whisky value! Here is an unusually fine harmony of mature whiskies and grain

neutral spirits comparable in quality to many blends selling for well over $4.00 the bottle. For added economy, we suggest
full quarts at $4.29 each, $49.95 the case.

3.99 46.75
GOOD NEWS! Old J. T. S. Brown is on sale once again during this pre-holiday season—here is the whiskey that outsold
every other Bonded Bourbon in Kentucky last year—an extraordinary feat in the state that is the birthplace of good
Bourbon. The distillery dates back to 1855. Beyond doubt, the most sensational bourbon opportunity that exists anywhere

Almost without exception the most discriminating of our Bourbon clientele report enthusias-
tically “that it is the best example of Kentucky whiskey available commercially today, regardless
of price.” Made at a small country distillery back in 1938, it was kept in oak barrels for 8 years
until it achieved full maturation—then it was bottled in bond at 100 proof in 1946. There were
only 280 cases in all and they are fast dwindling. If you are interested in securing superb
Bourbon in the classic tradition for your holiday drinking and Christmas gift giving, our advice
is that you anticipate your needs now, to avoid possible disappointment in December. Each
bottle bears its own handwritten number on the label.
