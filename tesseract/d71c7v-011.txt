NO BON VOYAGE GIFT can be more appreciated, or No
better timed, than iced Champagne delivered in the gay, 1

spirited “Le Can-Can”—delivered at the moment when a
it is most meaningful—when friends are gathered in the

stateroom ready to life their glasses in a farewell toast. a
And, not only is this gift imaginative, and the symbolic 5

way of saying “Bon Voyage,” but it need not even be ‘
costly. Simply pick your favorite Champagne (whether 1

Not long ago, at a party given by the “Champagne 7
Growers of France,” the genial member of our firm, 12
Jack Aaron, was given the award “l’Homme de 2
Champagne.” No small part in helping Jack Aaron 2
achieve this honor, was his creation of “Le Can- 3

Can”—many travel agents consider this the most
delightful and original of all Bon Voyage gifts. As To
tank eek a 9

a matter of fact, some seasoned boat voyagers
would no more dream of starting a journey without a
“Le Can-Can” as they would think of leaving their é

passports at home. Whether it be a gift to a sailing
friend, or for your own farewell party in the state- 6
room, we know of no better way of starting the trip 3

than “iced Champagne in Le Can-Can.”
