Our first shipment of the 1957 has arrived and it is beautiful. Here is the kind of heartwarming, cheerful
bottle you will get when you stop at one of the better restaurants of Avignon and ask for the good red wine
of the country. :

This vineyard, one of the most unusual of France, because of its large rock boulders, produces some of the
best red wine ideally suited for warm weather drinking. An extraordinary opportunity at this low cost

CHATEAUNEUF DU PAPE 1955, Clos des Felibres . . . . 2.19 24.50

Demonstrates great depth of flavor, complete roundness and a bouquet that is entirely remarkable. Here is
an estate bottled Chateauneuf, of great vintage year, produced at a vineyard considered the best in the town-
ship. Highly recommended. And there are half bottles at $1.19 each, $26.50 the case.

WESTMINSTER FINE TAWNY PORT . 1.99 22.65

From a century old Oporto firm comes this exceptional Tawny Port. It has enjoyed great vogue in England for
many decades, and as relatively dry Port, would represent good value at twice this price.

Dry, austere and distinctive, this fine Madeira is made from the classic Sercial grape. Also available at this same
