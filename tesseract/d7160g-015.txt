HOW TO STORE WINE

A “wine cellar’ in this day and age need not
be a cobwebbed vault far underground. It can
be a closet, a cool corner of the basement —
if needs must, even a couple of pantry. shelves.
The cost is not very great and the advantages
are considerable.

In the first place, there is the matter of
economy. Wines are cheaper, usually nearly
10% cheaper, when bought by the case.

Second, there is the matter of convenience.
It is at least reassuring to have a little reserve
on hand, when unexpected friends arrive over
a week-end or when a particularly successful
experiment is under way in the kitchen and a
good bottle seems called for.

Third, collecting wine is fun. There are
few hobbies so rewarding, that not only give
pleasure, but enable one to give pleasure to
one’s friends.

The thing is not very difficult. The spot
chosen should be as cool as possible (prefer-
ably never over 70 degrees). The bottles of
course should be stored lying on their side, so
that the corks remain moist and tight, admit-
ting no air. All sorts of ingenious racks and
bins may be purchased, to hold anywhere
from 12 bottles to a thousand; in the long
run, they will pay for themselves many times
