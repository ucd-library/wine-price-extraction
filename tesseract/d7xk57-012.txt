397 SYLVANER 1957 (Caves Hanhart) . . Litiien, iaee 2a ae
Here is a typical Alsatian wine made from the Sylvaner grape—fresh,
young, exceptionally light and delightful. A perfect choice for the
“Spritzer,” terrace dining and picnic lunches.

454 RIESLING 1957 (CavesHanhart). . . . . | 1.59 17.95
Riesling is one of the two greatest of all white wine grapes and par-
ticularly thrives among the steep hills of Alsace, where it produces a
dry wine of unusual charm. Here is an excellent example at a price
that will permit serving freely this summer.

476 GEWURZTRAMINER 1957 (Caves Hanhart) . _ 1.79 19.95

The most highly regarded grape of the district is the Gewurztraminer

which yields a wine not quite as dry as the Riesling, but with a bouquet

that is more prominent and more highly perfumed. This wine would
be an exceptional value at $2.25.

444 GEWURZTRAMINER GRAND CRU 1957 (F. Hugel) 2.89 31.13
The 1957 has just arrived and we do believe that here is the best single
example of white wine coming from the Alsatian district. Enthusias-
tically recommended for those who want Alsatian wine at its best—
extraordinary stature and depth.

753 ST. MICHEL BLANC (California) . . . 97 11.50

a cheerful little vin du pays of France. Like these, it is fresh, clean and
satisfying and there are half bottles at only 54¢ each, $13.00 the
case of 24.

quet. Also available in red or rose at the same price.
