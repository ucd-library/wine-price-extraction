Poveioss Giiey e

Tavel. the most famous Vin Rosé of France, comes from an arid, rocky little valley between
Avignon and Nimes. Estate bottled at one of the most favorably situated vineyards of
[avel. we do not think this Rosé is surpassed by any other produced anywhere in the

world.
BEAUJOLAIS ROSE 1955 (Domaine des Tours) . . . ¥&

The red wine from this vineyard, probably the best of the entire Beaujolais district, 1s
offered elsewhere among these pages. However, the owners set aside a portion of their
vineyard to the production of pink wines—usually for their own consumption. We tasted
it at the vineyard, fell in love with it and persuaded them to send us a small quantity.
It is entirely remarkable. Half-bottles at $1.09 each.
