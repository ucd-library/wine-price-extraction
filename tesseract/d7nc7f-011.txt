WHITE BURGUNDY

In the winter, the rich red wines of Burgundy dominate; in
the summer and early Fall, the classic white Burgundies play
a more important role in menu planning. Below you will dis-
cover the best of the area—from the utterly pleasing low-cost
Chardonnay to the noblest of all Montrachets.

1973 VINTAGE

The yield was record-breaking. The result was that some wines
were too light and thin but others were glorious where they
did not overproduce. It forced us to taste the wines carefully
and choose discriminately so that only the best would reach
you—those with a full quota of body and fruit.

1972 VINTAGE

The whites from the Céte de Beaune fared well enjoying
sufficient acidity to keep’them fresh and alive for at least
another five years. In Chablis, however, one must be chosen
carefully since many are simply too astringent and tart.

1971 VINTAGE

We summarize Frank Schoonmaker’s vintage chart, “In Chablis,
a scant half-crop was produced at best—many wines destined
to rank among the best of their decade. As for the whites of
the Céte d’Or, they appear to be of wholly remarkable quality,
full-bodied, rather high in alcohol, yet well-balanced and
capable of improving if laid away... unlike any year we have
had since the 1961s.”
