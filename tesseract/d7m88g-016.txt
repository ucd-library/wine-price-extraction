 

Many of our catalog readers have developed a genuine fondness for the work of
our illustrator and have made countless inquiries about him. Julian Brazelton
was born in Texas, studied art in Paris, and now lives in New York. His work
reflects the modern easy French approach to illustration and he is most at home
when handling the lighter, spontaneous art forms. He admits to great difficulty
in drawing a straight line. He has illustrated 30 books and is presently chiefly
occupied in street and memory sketching. We ourselves love him for his friend-
liness, humorous touch, flexibility, and unerring ability to capture the basic
essential of each art problem.
