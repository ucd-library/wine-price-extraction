the grapes so please forgive our enthusiasm.

CHATEAU MOUTON-ROTHSCHILD

PN Reh se cic cs cases os 69.50 49.95 579.50
Our Spring visit to Bordeaux yielded much fruit— perhaps the most worthy
plum was our ability to persuade the Bordelais to part with 15 cases of their
beloved Mouton-Rothschild ’67.

CHATEAU LATOUR (Pauillac)......... 60.00 52.50 599.00
In ’67, Latour and Mouton-Rothschild were the favorites of the Medoc
being both, wines of high Cabernet bouquet and flavor providing much
richness in a relatively light year.

Glorious wines of exceptional bouquet with superb balance and style. A bit lighter
in body than the “61s, but still sufficiently tannic to provide happy drinking
until 1995.

Lafite 61 at $3,000 too costly. Try its younger sister, quite its equal at one

Proclaimed as the “vintage of the century” Undoubtedly an exaggeration by the
media but, nevertheless, a truly great year. Softer, fruitier and less austere than the

sturdier 61s.
