M-12 CHATEAU GRAND PUY
LACOSTE. (Pauiliae) =. .< woos. 108.00 105.00

‘Grand Cru.’ Puy means ‘high point.’ Full-bodied, excellent.

M-21 CHATEAU PICHON LALANDE
ame 108.00 99.50
Distinguished for balance and depth of flavor. Similar in
characteristics to the Chateau Latour vineyard, which it
surrounds on three sides.

M-19 CHATEAU MONTROSE

(Se taeeune) a 114.75 99.50
Rich, full, slow to mature, big—in the style of Chateau
Latour.
M-29 CHATEAU MOUTON-BARON
PHILIPPE (Pamitine) 3.3... 135.00 135.00

This vineyard was formerly part of Chateau Mouton-Roths-
child, and then was separated in about 1800. The proprietor
is the same—Baron Philippe de Rothschild. An excellent
‘Grand Cru’—a bit lighter than Mouton, but of the same
noble heritage and breed.

M-25 CHATEAU BEYCHEVELLE
(Sie FAO). 2 oa ei 157.50 135.00
Finesse is distinguishing characteristic of this noble vine-
yard—graceful and elegant.

M-30A CHATEAU LA MISSION
HAUT BRION (Graves)............171.00 171.00
Distinguishing characteristics are balance, finesse—the su-
perb flavor of Graves, and longevity. A classic claret.

Here are the ‘noblest vineyards of them all’ Vineyards that set the
standard—not only for the red wines of Bordeaux, but for the red
wines of the world. Here are clarets endowed with such power,
balance and longevity that they will be alive and vibrant even two
decades hence.

Just as an art collector attempts to buy Picasso and Chagall shortly
after the painting is completed in the fond expectation that he will
not only enjoy its ownership, but relax in the certainty that the price
will surely go up later—the same is true about the wine masterpieces
of Bordeaux.

M-33. CHATEAU MARGAUX
(Wien 295.00 295.00

Tasting from cask, it is displaying fine deep color, good
balance and rich bouquet.

M-37 CHATEAU HAUT BRION

(Gravest § 0° 2 e328 295.00 295.00
Very big, full; power, combined with elegance. Undoubtedly,
the best Graves produced in 1970—in the same exalted league
as Lafite, Mouton and Latour.

M-34. CHATEAU CHEVAL BLANC

(oc Eailienh) ee 295.00 345.00
As in Petrus, the Merlot grape came through absolutely
‘perfect,’ providing one of the best Cheval Blancs of the
generation.

M-32 CHATEAU LATOUR (Pauillac) .... 395.00 395.00
Full-bodied, firm, but with exceptional softness in 1970. Will
live for decades.

M-31 CHATEAU PETRUS (Pomerol)..... 395.00 395.00
Because of health of Merlot grapes, Chateau Petrus 1970
may well be the best Petrus produced in the last two decades.
Only 16 acres—hard to come by. Dramatic velvetyness.

M-36 CHATEAU MOUTON

ROTHSCHILD (Pauiilac) .......... 395.00 395.00
Baron Philippe de Rothschild is proud of the bigness,
power, and beautiful balance of his 1970 Mouton—certainly
one of the greatest of his post-war years.

M-35 CHATEAU LAFITE-

ROTHSCHILD (Pauillac) .........435.00 410.00
We have watched the Lafite 1961 and 1959 climb to the $500
per case mark and beyond. Given another decade, the same
astronomic climb will surely happen to Lafite 1970.
