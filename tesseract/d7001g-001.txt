  

THE GREAT 1952 RHINE & MOSELLE WINES ON SALE!

Most German wines should be drunk yaing, while they are still fresh es eee rae else their
delicacy might be lost. This is particularly true of the ote pe Ria) Here
is an opportunity to drink fine German wines in the same youthful state at which they are
consumed in the homes and restaurants along the banks of the Rhine and Moselle. These
amazingly low sale prices are only made possible because the wines were purchased
immediately after the harvest, before subsequent high reputation achieved by this vintage
forced the price up substantially. Many of these wines regularly sell for 50% higher, We
suggest that you anticipate your Spring and Summer requirements now while our inventory
permits these low sale prices.
