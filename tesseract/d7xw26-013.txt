it, but we do think that we

noblest of Bourbons that

port his favorite spirit in
cask on mule-back. I.W.

Bourbon in Louisville for a
long, long time and know
how to do it. The Managing
Director of the distillery,
when he honors his favorite
guests, does so by serving
his I.W. Harper 10 Year Old,
: bottled at a mellow, beauti-
Lo Hic fully-balanced 86 proof. You
| can honor those on your gift

BENEDICTINE and B & B
Each Can Be Poured Separately Out of the
Same 2 Compartment Bottle!

seseecseeenmmmamesmnnnnanusteniinercennnmstastceteeeett

There is beauty, func-
tional usefulness, and
high excellence in this
two-headed Benedictine
creation.

In addition to its amusing
effect as a gift, it has the
practical virtue of permit-
ting you to serve the ex-
cellent Benedictine — and
for those who want it a bit
dryer, you are in a posi-
tion to immediately pour
the B & B, a combina-
tion of Benedictine and

brandy.

TRADITIONAL DRINK OF BRITISH NAVY
PLYMOUTH GIN

The fame of Plymouth Gin goes back over 150 years of
loyal support by officers and sailors of the British Navy.
The expression ‘Plymouth, Old Boy’ brings back to re-
tired British admirals a thousand memories of ‘Pink Gin’
consumed in every clime. (‘Pink Gin’ is simply 2 drops
of Angostura bitters added to 2 icy ounces of Plymouth
Gin).

PLYMOUTH GIN owes its superiority to dedicated dis-
tillation, a secret, unrevealed recipe, and the soft clear
water of the river Dart. There is only one Plymouth Gin
in the whole world, and that is made in Plymouth,
England, by Coates & Co., established in 1793. It is 94.4
proof, extra dry, and will produce the driest, cleanest
Martini you have ever experienced. The price is aston-
ishingly low. Normally, this world-famous Gin commands

below 6.61 the bottle. Note our sale price. (Below 69.96
case) Below 5.99
