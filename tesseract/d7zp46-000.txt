Perhaps the most intriguing, is the historic 1792 Solera
Madeira. The “London Daily Telegraph’ of October
Sth, 1841, refers to the Vintage 1792 as having been
purchased by Napoleon I in 1815 when he called at

Madeira on his way further south to St. Helena in exile.

of Autumn than to alert you in these pages to some of
our “favorites” — those bottles in our century-old cellars

that we consider particularly notable.
