premier vineyard town of the Rheingau. California winemakers have brought
two names together—to describe one of the most flowery, most aromatic, and
most popular of California white wines.

We present here several attractively dry examples of the Johannisberg Ries-
ling—the sort of wine that makes a delightful aperitif, complements dishes of
trout, chicken or pork, and perfection with fruit or nuts.

Sauvignon Blanc, the grape of Sancerre and Pouilly-Fume—and the major grape
of white Bordeaux—achieves impressive success in California. At last year’s
Gault-Millau “Wine Olympiad? first and third places went to Sauvignon Blancs
from California.

Robert Mondavi was the first to give the name “Fume Blanc” to wines made from
this grape—perhaps because a hint of smokeiness is found in some of them. Weare
not sure about the smoke. But we are glad that the lovely fruit of California Fume
Blancs, often enhanced by maturing in small oak casks, makes them such a
marvelous accompaniment to foods, especially sea food.

The wines we list below—all of them in the drier style—are among the most
appealing Fume Blancs we have tasted in recent years.
