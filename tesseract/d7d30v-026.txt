For the greatest dry white wines of the world, one
must look to Burgundy. We herald enthusiastically the
great ’66s—wines of fantastic breed, airy lightness, and
extraordinary bouquet. Since the two succeeding years,
1967 and 1968, have proven dismal failures among the
white wines of Burgundy, we can only urge—no, we
feel we should plead—that you acquire them now be-
fore they are gone forever or the prices skyrocket.
And happily, most will thrive for another decade.

455 PINOT GHARDONNAY............ 1.59 17.415

Made from the same grape as used in the famous white Burgun-
dies, this wine possesses the same unmistakable flavor and dry
finish but not the fullness of its more expensive neighbors. A wine
that needs no occasion—a price that needs no second thought.

3820 MAGON Viki. . 3.65 2.19 23.65
Estate Bottled, Rt. Hon. Ernest Marples

A fresh, dry, fragrant white wine made from the Pinot Chardonnay
grape. The best white wine of the Macon.

685 POUILLY TUIGSE .. ...2 2... 2.49 26.90

From the Cellars of Nicolas, Paris

A wine of great charm, this Pouilly-Fuissé provides a lovely solu-
tion to the hostess problem; an inexpensive white wine to serve
without fuss to people who enjoy good, dry wine.

792 POUILLY=UISS0 4.420. 2 2.85 32.49
From the Cellars of the Rt. Hon. Ernest Marples

We were with Ernest Marples when he chose this wine. We met
the grower—a dignified farmer whose family’s wine-growing his-
tory goes back for centuries. An outstanding expression of the
heights that can be achieved in the Pouilly-Fuissé area.

319 CHASSAGNE-MONTRACHET ..... 3.49 37.70
Estate Bottled, Ramonet

Even a village wine in the hands of the Ramonet family becomes a
thing of beauty. We have visited the Ramonets often and we can
only say that no one in Burgundy matches their white wine skill.
It was not by accident that the Hospices de Beaune have selected
them to care for their white wines for the annual auction.

456 GHABLIS EPINOTIZ ......:..-... 3.49 37.70

Estate Bottled, Marcel Servin

We first visited Marcel Servin in 1950. He enjoys the reputation in
the village of Chablis as the best wine maker of them all. He has
maintained that reputation since. Here is a wine of heritage.

351 CHABLIS BOUGEUS ......... =. 3.99 43.10
Estate Bottled, Marcel Servin

There are only eight ‘Grand Cru’ vineyards in all of Chablis and
this is one of the best of them. In the hands of Servin, you will be
dealing with Chablis at its absolute best. Dry, much finesse, very
long-lived. A classic.

A-1 MEURSAULT CHARMES .......... 449 48.50
Estate Bottled, J. Matrot

The recent Time-Life wine book gives the high classification
“Great” to only three vineyards in Meursault—and Charmes is
among the three. Soft, round, haunting bouquet with scent of
violets. Half bottles at 2.89 each, 51.50 case.

442 CHASSAGNE MONTRACHET,
Rucholies 0%... 520). 2... 4.99 53.90
Estate Bottled, Ramonet

This vineyard has been a consistent favorite of ours since we first
tasted it in Ramonet’s cellars back in 1948. His skill is impeccable.

840 CORTON CHARLEMAGNE ........ 5.49 59.30

Estate Bottled, Bonneau de Martray

When Corton Charlemagne is good, it is classed with the illustrous
Montrachet. Great breed, and steelier than most white Burgundies.
The slopes are the steepest in Burgundy and must be tended by
hand since horses and oxen cannot climb here. Remarkable, scarce
and excellent.

356 BEAUNE, CLOS DES MOUCHES.... 6.19 66.69

From Ancient Cellars of Joseph Drouhin

Fast becoming the most popular white Burgundy of all those avail-
able in New York. Featured by the leading restaurants and im-
ported by Michel Dreyfus. Superb and delicate.

219 BATARD MONTRACHET...... ... 6.99 79.50
Estate Bottled, Ramonet

Dry, yet rounded; great elegance and breed and a haunting, capti-
vating bouquet. Half bottles available at 3.64 each, 78.50 case.

352 CHEVALIER MONTRACHET ...... 8.95 96.65
Estate Bottled, Chartron

Total vineyard is only twelve acres, and Chartron owns but two of
them, producing not much more than 200 cases per year. We know
of no wine more difficult to obtain nor more worth getting when
you finally acquire it. You will note the enveloping richness with
no trace of sweetness, coupled with extraordinary perfume and
magnificent balance. Often greater than Montrachet itself.

402 LE MONTRACHET............ 9.95 107.45
From the Cellars of Pierre Poupon
King of white wines. Superb in 1966—and will continue to develop

for at least another decade. Extraordinary low price for a fine
wine of this truly great vineyard.
24a Lb. WONTRAGIIE 0.65.52. es 15.05 162.50

Estate Bottled, Marquis de Laguiche

Rabelais always referred to this wine as ‘‘the divine Montrachet,”
and Dumas proclaimed that “it should be drunk kneeling and bare-
headed”. The nobility of Burgundy has no higher royalty than
“le Montrachet”, generally considered to be the greatest dry white
wine of the world.

375. MUSIGNY BLANG 3... 2.05. ns

Estate Bottled, Comte de Vogue

..18.25 197.10

Musigny is more famous for its red wines. However, a microscopic
quantity of big, powerful, well-balanced white wine of tremendous
bouquet and flavor is produced here. It costs a king’s ransom to
acquire any of it in Burgundy—and you are lucky to get it. It is
generally rationed out by the bottle even on a commercial level.
Truly magnificent. Quantity limited.
