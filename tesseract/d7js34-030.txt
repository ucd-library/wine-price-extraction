TEQUILA, the national drink of Mex-
ico, is crossing the border and invad-
ing the U.S. In the southwest, when
they are hot and thirsty, they drink

‘Tequila and Tonic with lime; at Sun-

day brunches along the Pacific they
serve ‘the Bloody Matador which is
simply a Bloody Mary made with
Tequila, which imparts adefinite mas-
culine flavor; and at Guadalajara they
serve cool, refreshing Tom Collins,
using Tequila instead of Gin.

It. is made of the Mezcal century
plants. Its distillation goes back to

the 18th Century, and symbolizes the

Spirit of colorful Mexico. It will be
fun, for your friends and you, to. serve
this summer.

Here is the summer drink of all Denmark, Most AQUAVIT ae
enthusiasts like to serve Aalborg straight and icy, icy cold.
The most dramatic way is to freeze the bottle in a block
of ice and then watch the pleasurable look on the faces of
your guests as they ‘down it accompanied by appetizers,
canapés, herrings, and flavorsome sandwiches.

In Denmark, it represents over 70% of all spirits con-
sumed — in the U.S.A., it has caught on with the “taste
makers” as they serve it instead of Vodka in the Bloody
Mary; or as an intriguing alternative, with beef-bouillon
instead of tomato juice; and with Schweppes Bitter Lemon.

The Danes are known for .their humanity, civilized way of
life, and for. their unique Akvavit'with its subtle hint of cara-
way flavor which adds distinction and freshness to any
summer drink. Try it.

In the summer, all France drinks RICARD,
mixed with five parts of water, over ice.

THE EVIDENCE — over 30 million litres
of Ricard are consumed annually and
account for 50% of all the aperitifs,
liqueurs and spirits drunk-in France.

In a brief period, this has created the
one-man RICARD EMPIRE which in-
cludes the Island of Bendor. on the
Riviera; much of the cowboy country

near Marseilles; ports; hotels; an air- / t
port; shipyards; a bull ring in south- kK BA

PAUL RICARD, only 50, was a painter

and movie star. Not too long ago, he a oe
met.an old shepherd whose ‘pastis’
was cool and delightful. Everything Dreyfas, Hubby & to
followed from this encounter. The
drink, whose formula young Paul re-
membered, has now become ‘Ricard,’
a mixture of anis, licorice and aro-
matic herbs from the Provencal
mountains, macerated in spirits. With
the addition of the right amount of
water (5 parts) this mixture magi-
cally turns into a cloudy liquid whose
very appearance is thirst-quenching.
Tourists have been sampling this
drink on the Cote d’Azur or in a Paris
Cafe, and now repeat the experience
back home in nostalgic reminis-
cences of Provencel and France.

On the auto route from
Bordeaux to the Pyrenees,
there flashes almost every
kilometer a large bill poster
that reads “LILLET.” It is
the popular aperitif of
southwest France, made in
the region, and its undoubt-
edly the driest, the most
sophisticated and the pleas-
antest of this country’s
aperitifs. Many of us know
its virtues when served “as
is,” over ice, or mixed with
soda.
