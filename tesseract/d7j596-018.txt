More and more Americans have adopted the French habit of drinking their Beaujolais young, whi i
freshness of the new wine are at their peak. At the same time, Anigticd a penne to eerane: faa cet ia ae
common denominator Beaujolais is not enough, and they are asking for more and more examples of the finer
Beaujolais—from such superior Beaulojais communes as Fleurie (renowned for its fine bouquet), and Moulin A Vent
(known for its fuller flavor and staying powers).

The honest, unstretched Beaujolais of 1962, from good vineyard soil, and Estate-bottled, are typical and very pleasant.
They have improved beyond original expectations and are, today, ready for drinking—young and fresh. Since the 1963
vintage is poor, outside a few exceptions, 1962 is likely to be the best Beaujolais values for the next year or two, what
with the prices constantly marching up in France because of depletion, and a generally disappointing 1963.

We offer here two of the best Beaujolais of France in the regular 24-o0z. bottle and in the graceful, ‘in-between’ bottle—
fondly called a “Pot”, which holds a generous 17 oz.—not as large as a regular bottle, but almost 50% larger than the
half bottle. If it is dinner for two, we suggest the “Pot”—if more than two, the bottle size. And for those who drink

their Beaujolais more sparingly, there are also half bottles. SALE PRICE

One of the best years in this century—in St. Emilion and Pomerol, it was astonishingly great—and in the Medoc, they
have not experienced such remarkable wines since 1945. However, these comments, true in almost every instance
as far as the great Chateau bottlings are concerned, are not of equal significance when applied to regional wines.
In the instance of regionals, the quality is more dependent on the quality of the wine that the shipper chooses, and
the skill he employs in blending them. If the base has a high proportion of really fine 1961, whether it be Medoc,
Bordeaux Rouge or St. Emilion, we are contending with a superior regional wine. We were careful here—these
regionals of FRESNAY FRERES have gone through several comparative tastings against wines supplied by other
shippers. The wines of Fresnay weathered the storm beautifully, they achieved high ratings, and we can state un-
hesitatingly that at these prices, we suspect that this is the best buy that can oe acquired anywhere in New York by the

consumer who is interested in quality and low cost. SALE PRICE
