Bottle Case

WISDOM’S FINO PALMA 3.59 17.95
This classic “Fino Palma”, bottled with great care in Jerez, has helped the
century old firm of Wisdom & Warter achieve its great international reputation.
Bone dry, pale, straw colored, the ideal aperitif Sherry to serve, slightly chilled,
in city apartment or country terrace. Equals other Finos that sell for over 3.00.

WISDOM’S ROYAL OLOROSO 1.79 19.95
There are few wines produced in the world that quite achieve the rich, deep
flavor, or dark color depth of a fine Brown Sherry. Here is a typical fully aged
example. Highly recommended between meals with fruit, nuts or cake, or as an
after dinner dessert wine.

WISDOM’S AMONTILLADO FINO 1.99 22.65
This Amontillado belongs to the Fino family, but it acquires other characteristics
as it matures; it is very dry, more amber in color, more nutty in flavor and some-
what more body. A 3.50 value.

WISDOM’S GOLDEN CREAM 2.49 27.95
Our clientele constantly asks us how we can sell a Cream Sherry of this luxurious
depth at 3.00. The answer is mass purchasing and modest profit. Now, on sale at
2.49. it is a dramatic value, since it quite easily matches in virtue Cream Sherry
that sell for 5.00 the bottle. O5
