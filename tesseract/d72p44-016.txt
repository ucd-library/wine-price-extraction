CHATEAU BOUSCAUT

GRAND CRU GRAVES — BORDEAUX

 

Frank Schoonmaker’s Encyclopedia states, “Chateau Bouscaut is one
of the most important and best-tended vineyards of the Graves district,
south of Bordeaux.” It was classified in 1953 among the eleven top
Graves vineyards making red wines — a classification that also in-
cludes Chateau Haut Brion and Chateau La Mission Haut Brion. To
understand why it was possible for Chateau Bouscaut to provide the
wine-drinking world with such aged and treasured red wines, we quote
from Alexis Lichine’s Encyclopedia, “Bouscaut continues the aging
and selling of its wine in bottle —a practice instituted long ago by
the Place family. Few large vineyards could start today the expensive
process of having to wait over a number of years, without income, be-
fore selling bottle-aged wines; but behind the barrel-stores at Bouscaut
are a dozen room-sized lockers containing thousands of bottles of wine
being aged.” It is from this TREASURE CELLAR that we offer you
the range of vintages from 1949 through 1970.

Not long ago, the WALL STREET JOURNAL reported the acquist-
tion of this vineyard, Chateau Bouscaut, by a small group of United
States businessmen led by Charles Wohlstetter, Chairman of Continen-
tal Telephone, Howard Sloan, insurance executive, and Allan Meltzer,
public relations consultant. Other Americans who have acquired vine-
yards in Bordeaux are the Dillon family, who have owned Chateau
Haut Brion since 1986; Alexis Lichine, who has been associated with
Chateau Lascombes and Prieure-Lichine since 1952; and a group of
wine-loving Americans who, only last year, proudly obtained control
of Chateau Fourcas-Hostein in the Medoc.

In the LONDON OBSERVER, Cyril Ray, one of Britain’s leading

wine critics states, “The Clarets of the Graves district, except Chateau
Haut Brion, have not been as publicized or have become as famous as

they deserve to be, and many of them therefore,
I consider to be under-priced compared with the
finest Medocs.

“On two or three occasions recently,” continues
Mr. Ray, “I have tasted current vintages of Chateau |
Bouscaut, a fine, full-bodied, yet far from heavy
wine, grown on a famous property only a five-mile
bus ride from the center of Bordeaux. Chateau
Bouscaut is typical of red Graves in developing
more quickly than a comparable Medoc, yet last-

ing as long.
