Kentucky Straight
Bourbon Whiskey

Bottled from a Limited Number
of Barrels each yielding about 123
bottles. Each bottle of this bourbon ts
individually numbered and registered.

Bottledn DOWLING DISTILLERS

1865 Cognac, pre-expulsion
Chartreuse, and original
Currier & Ives prints. (Some
of these whiskies, now when
found, fetch as much as $60
the bottle.)

We believe that at last, our
generation, has provided a
bourbon that will match the
best of the pre-Prohibition
Bourbons. It is not just good
—but superb—a true collec-
tor’s item.

There are not many barrels
of 16 Year Old Whiskey in
all Kentucky—each yields no
more than 128 bottles (we
marvel at the patience of our
Kentucky friends who had
the fortitude to keep the
whiskey so long in wood in
face of serious loss in evap-
oration — over 50% during
16 years).

There is no older or finer
bourbon commercially avail-
able today than COLLEC-
TOR’S ITEM. We proudly
offer these bottles to those
seeking the finest Kentucky
Bourbon in existence today
——whether it be for your own
requirements or as a unique
Christmas gift for apprecia-
tive friends.
