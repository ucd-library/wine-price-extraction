SHERRY:S A WINE LIST TO GREET 1964

This list represents the essence—the ultimate survivors of countless tastings among two thousand candidates

judged during the past three years. We have weeded out the pedestrian and have tried to achieve the best
of class in relation to heritage, as well as cost.

We know of no gift giving that is more symbolic of the Yuletide spirit—nor more traditional—than sending
your friends a few bottles of good wine as your personal messenger of good cheer. And in the spirit of
Christmas generosity, we also suggest that you send yourself some bottles from this list—perhaps the

largest, most carefully selected and complete wine list that has ever been offered to the wine lovers of

 

America.

NOTES ON RED BORDEAUX

Though nature was not kind to the European wine growers in 1963, nevertheless, the
Bordeaux vignerons have little to complain about as they ponder their barrels of fruity,
pleasant 1962s; their useful, charming, wonderfully-ready-to-drink 1960s; and their
glorious bottles of great 1959s which have done more to stimulate world wide interest
in wine drinking than practically any event since the invention of the corkscrew.

And now, in their quiet way, perhaps the greatest of them all—the 1961s—are arriving in

the New York harbor to bring their cheerful notes of drinking pleasure to wine lovers.

1961 did not receive the same glowing press as did the ’59s. The crop was but half the

 

size, the prices at the opening were double those of the ’59s, but surely they were better
in St. Emilion and Pomerol, and certainly a match in the Medoc. However, the character-

istics are different, the 61s have more fat and texture, will not appear as charming at the

beginning—many of them destined for long life. No one who makes claim to having a G0%6

cellar can afford to be without them. Macau 244 CHATEAU BEAU RIVAGE [7 1.99 21.95
