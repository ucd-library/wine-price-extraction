Just as Mark Spitz is the rising meteor in the

¢ 12E international world of swimming champion-

ships, ‘Kir’ or ‘Vin Blanc Cassis’ suddenly
dominates the galaxy of apéritifs. ‘Kir’ has
been the rage of French restaurants for al-
most a decade. Now, in New York, we can
hardly go to good French restaurants such
as Lutéce, La Grenouille, Quo Vadis, Veau
d’Or, Caravelle, Cote Basque, or Le Mistral,
without being aware that almost everyone,
before dinner, is ordering ‘Kir.’ Even at the
excellent ‘21’ Club, Four Seasons, and
Maxwell’s Plum, it has become the ‘in’ drink.
Basically, it consists of 4 02. of good dry
white wine mixed with 1 oz. of Créme de
Cassis (Black Currant Liqueur)—light, fruity,
delicious, and zestful.

Peter Sichel, world-famous wine authority,
after two years of research in France, did
learn how to make KIR GALLIQUE, which is
the perfect blend of good dry white wine and
Creme de Cassis. Mr. Sichel has persuaded
his friends to constantly keep a bottle of
‘Kir Gallique’ in their home refrigerators,
ready to serve at a moment's notice. Being
mathematicians by nature, we have discov-
ered, happily enough, that it costs less to do
it the ‘Kir Gallique’ way, than buying the
costly ingredients, (about $8.00 for the
Creme de Cassis), and doing it on your own.

The price? only $2.98 the bottle, and there
is further economy if you buy a full case at
$32.18.

POUILLY-FUME 1971
BY DE LADOUCETTE

In the world of white wines,
Burgundy has its Montrachet
—and the Loire Valley has
its LADOUCETTE. Produced
at Chateau Du Nozet, it is
considered one of the great
white wines of France.

TIO PEPE

Speak to a Spanish noble-
man and he will tell you that
the classic bone-dry and
most distinguished sherry of
Spain is TIO PEPE. Instead
of a martini, suggest you
serve this chilled before din-
ner—you can even add an
olive to it. Will make the
wines at the dinner taste
better. (67.88 case)

Portrayed here is our associate Michael
Aaron and Peter Sichel, happily enjoying
Kir Gallique. Peter Sichel likes it au naturel
or else, ‘on-the-rocks’—Michael likes it with
a sliver of lemon, adding dryness and re-
freshing acidity.

Why is it called ‘Kir’? Many of us are aware
of the famed French Resistance hero Canon
Felix Kir. He was indeed a remarkable priest
because he was a head of the French Re-
sistance during World War Il, ultimately
honored by the populace by being elected
Mayor of Dijon and a member of the French
Parliament. The vignerons and peasants of
Burgundy loved him with such intensity that
they changed the name of their beloved
beverage ‘Vin Blanc Cassis,’ to ‘Kir,’ honor-
ing him during his life time. The name per-
sists, and its devotées multiply annually.

our associate, Michael Aaron, happily im-
bibing KIR GALLIQUE.
