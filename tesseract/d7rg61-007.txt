BOLLIC Case

CHATEAU TALBOT (St. Julien) 12.95 150.00
Here is a beautiful, understated but elegant claret.

Personifies the very nature of the 1967 vintage.

CHATEAU GRUAUD LAROSE (St. Julien) 12.95
A Second Growth Grand Cru - an exalted category indeed

since it was excelled in the 1855 Medoc classification
only by Lafite, Mouton, Latour and Margaux.

CHATEAU LAFITE-ROTHSCHILD (Pauillac) 29.95
The elegance and haunting finesse of Lafite is

the characteristic for which it is famous.

CHATEAU MOUTON-ROTHSCHILD 34.95 399.00
(Pauillac)

The power of the dominant Cabernet

Sauvignon grape became the critical factor

in making this '67 Mouton so great. A beautiful
harmony of lightness of the vintage, and the

depth of Mouton were in perfect counterpoint,

as if Arturo Toscanini were conducting the vintage.

 

 

 

 

Red Bordeaux

Wine lovers throughout the world have re-discovered the incomparable drinking
pleasure that comes from the great, totally mature wines of Bordeaux. As a
result, prices for these rare bottles have soared in both Europe and America.

We are fortunate to have many in our cellars. Only a few cases remain, however,
and the likelihood of replacing them at anything like their original cost is
dim indeed. We urge you act quickly - before these treasures are gone.
