RED BORDEAUX
1970 REGIONALS

The rise in prices for Bordeaux regionals is astonishing.. Ac-
cording to the Sichel Report from Bordeaux, they have gone
up Over 300% within the last two years. The Bordeaux shippers
are now paying the growers over $30.00 the case for the 1972
Medoc and St. Emilion in order to replenish their stocks. Per-
haps these exorbitant prices will ultimately reach the New York
consumer, but in the interval, we are offering the best regionals
of Bordeaux—from specific vineyards—at livable prices.

1970 VINTAGE CHATEAUX

For over a century, the historic firm of Louis Eschenauer has
made it a practice to buy wine in cask from excellent small
vineyards of the area and bottle the harvest in their own chais,
rather than at the vineyard. All six of the wines listed below
represent the better vineyards of their respective wine growing
districts, and will’ please the most discriminating palate. Ac-
quired early, before devaluation and higher prices, we have
decided to pass the savings on to you, rather than reflect the
higher prices now prevailing in the Bordeaux market. All six
of these wines are available for immediate delivery.

We have just returned from a ten day stay in Bordeaux, spend-
ing all of our time at the vineyards and in the company of the
leading courtiers, growers and negociants. :

To give you some insight as to the cost of the wines in Bordeaux
today, we quote some examples, using as our standard the low-
est possible price achieveable F.O.B. on a wholesale basis (cal-
culated at 23.5c per franc). To this must be added ocean freight,
insurance, state tax, federal tax, local trucking, and importer’s
and retailer’s profits— Chateau Lafite Rothschild 1970 (1,800
francs or $423); Chateau Latour (1,800 francs or $423); Chateau
Mouton Rothschild (1,620 francs or $380); Chateau Haut Brion
(1,500 francs or $352.50); La Mission Haut Brion (1,020 francs or
$239.70); Chateau Leoville Lascases (624 francs or $146.64);
Chateau Pavie (444 francs or $104.34); Chateau Pichon Lalande
(564 francs or $132.54).

We feel we should bring to your attention these lowest compe-
titive Bordeaux trade quotations since they indicate clearly
that the 1970s—the best vintage year since 1961—will move up
substantially in price when present world holdings are sold out.
Replacements will ultimately take place on levels even higher
than those shown above, when the '70s, already in short supply,
become even scarcer. Since we are offering a 10% discount
during the Summer, we strongly advise acquisition now, with
delivery to your home or warehouse in the Fall.

We are not able to quote below all Chateaux since we are al-
ready out of stock in some vineyards. Should you have a favor-
ite, and you do not see it listed here, we will gladly quote on
request. In making your selection, do not overlook some of the
unsung heros that are available to you below $60 the case.
Several of them, such as Latour Haut Vignoble, Greysac, Bous-
caut, Camensac and Picque Caillou, represent sensational op-
portunities, and in some instances, well below the present
Bordeaux quotations.

Delivery by October 1973—and in some instances, this Summer.
