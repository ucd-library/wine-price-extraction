SINGLE CASK UNBLENDED COGNAC
OF THE 1934 VINTAGE

    
    

The knowledgeable Cognac drinkers of France consider this the
best example of brandy produced in their country, regardless of
price, age, or package elegance. We now concur with that opinion,
after much comparative tasting.

 
      

Here is an estate-bottled Cognac that was produced during a great
vintage year (1934) in the most celebrated part of the Cognac
country, “Grande Fine
Champagne.” It has
remained in its un-
blended state in barrel
from 1934 until the
present date.
