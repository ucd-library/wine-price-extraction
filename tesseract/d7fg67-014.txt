A PRACTICAL PICNIC NOTE

| rather hesitate to leave the poetry of
Litchen creation and move into the mun
dane problem of how to keep these cold
foods cold from house to picnic grounds.
The basket that Little Red Riding Hood
used when going to ¢ srandmother’s house
would hardly do it—the pate would be
warm and soft and I fear the hard-boiled
eggs would hardly achieve the proper
degree of crisp coolness

I would suggest—no, I would urge—that
vou quickly acquire the ASCOT
THERMO KEEP BAG from a good ac-

cessory store or get it from Sherr ’s where

it is sold as a gift container.

It is of giant, generous size that can hold
enough for a large picnic party (16” wide,
10” deep and 10” high); it is straw-col-
ored and looks like straw; it is very hand-
some and is made of all those things used
to keep COLD things COLD, such as
vinyl, plastic, fiber glass and all those
other things that man has invented to
combat the effects of heat and the sun.
It even has zippers and a useful side

pocket. My scouts tell me that it retails
everywhere for $10.00; but if acquired at
Sherry’s filled with a few bottles of your
favorite wines and spirits—it holds up to
twelve bottles—the cost to you will be
only $4.95 additional. If I am to believe
my friends. here is one of New York's
best buys; an ideal summer gift to your
hostess filled with a few bottles of wine;
and an absolutely indispensable item be-
tween now and Halloween. And only

$4.95!

“LE CAN-CAN” IN PARIS
When in New York, I hardly ever have
seen a sailing without Sherry’s “Le Can-
Can” filled with iced Champagne not
playing some role in the proceedings.
Here I am in Paris and I have met at least
tour people who have used “Le Can-Can
as part of their luggage accessories to
carry odds and ends’—the Toulouse-Lau-
trec poster on the outside seems to blend
with the Paris mood. If any of your

friends should be boarding a vessel en

route to Europe, don’t overlook sending
at least one bottle of iced Champagne in
“Le Can-Can’—an exciting Bon Voyage
gift with the gay touch of the Continent.
And it’s only $2.95 additional!

WHAT IF HE GOES BY AIR?

This is the question my friends often ask
me—because they would love to send “Le
Can-Can” to departing air travelers, Dut
there is the matter of weight to consider
and how to get it to the airport. Sherry’s
reports to me that they now have a quite
practical solution called the “TRAVEL
TOTE BAG,” definitely handsome, light
cream in color, trimmed with a black zip-
per. It is easy to carry, 15” high, made of

 

J and can Carry three times as

soft viny
airline bag. Here 1s

much as the average

Sherry’s mad idea;

 

|. Send the “Travel Tote Bag” with
two handy half-bottles of Scotch to your
friends at their home the day before de-
parture

2. Enclose a card that reads somewhat
as follows: ‘to be taken over water, in the
air, en route to Paris and London. They
will be delighted to have these bottles
in the airplane

3. Your friends will be grateful to you
for this extra bit of luggage which they
can carry with them to their seat on the
plane, holding books, magazines, toilet
articles, etc
Although this normally sells for $5.00,
the cost at Sherry’s as a gift container is
but a modest $2.50. If you enclose two
half-bottles of Ballantine Scotch ($3.44
each ), the total cost of the gift would be
only $9.38 a sensational Bon Voyage
salute to friends who choose to spurn
the luxury of ocean travel for the magic
carpet speed of the jet-—And only $2.50!

“BOIS IN NEW YORK”
[t all happened while I was in Hong Kong
and it is now a joy I look forward to on
my return! The Tavern-on-the-Green,
beautifully nestled among the trees of

Central Park has long been a familiar

 

sight on the New York scene. | just
learned that it has recently become the
proud property of those creative restau-
rateurs who own the Four Seasons and
the Forum of the Twelve Caesars. In their
note to me, they promise to do nothing
about changing the foliage, the horse-
back riders that go by, or the skyline, but
they do promise to do something about
the restaurant’s decor, the menu, and the
preparation of the food. I have known
Joseph Baum, the Executive Director of
Restaurant Associates for many years and
I am convinced he has the creative ima-
gination, the dedication to good things
and the stamina to ultimately turn the
Tavern-on-the-Green into one of the out-
standing restaurants of New York City.
As a matter of fact, he writes that it 1s

happening right now. Only two days ago
