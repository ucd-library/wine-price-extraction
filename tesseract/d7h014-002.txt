RED BORDEAUX

1974 VINTAGE ~ While still very young, the 1974's were a trifle hard, but they have
developed beautifully over the past year. The wines listed here are generous, full
of fruit--and reminiscent of the attractive '67s.

'Bouscaut! and ‘Haut Brion' -- the two vineyards we
delight visiting when in the Graves area.

Round richness of St. Emilion reflected here.

Love the vineyard, the wine and the proprietor, Alexis
Lichine. When in Bordeaux we delight in staying there
as it is the intellectual wine center of the Medoc.

Alexis Lichine is still the inspiration of this great
Margaux vineyard.

Adjacent to Mouton Rothschild in Pauillac area.

Competes with Chateau Margaux itself for the crown of

this noble wine commune.
One of the great 1974 Bordeaux.
Smooth, silky and endowed with much flavor.

Numerous blind tastings show
this brilliant wine to be best of

the vintage. Has a long life
ahead. Outstanding.
