 

1966 CHATEAU BOTTLED

A great, great claret year—a worthy successor to the classic ’61s
—and an excellent precursor to the ’70s. In the grand tradition—
beautifully balanced—long-lived. Rapidly disappearing off the
market.

No. Bottle Gase

159 CHATEAU MAISON BLANCHE .......-- 2.49 26.90
Discovered on the hills above St. Emilion. Excellent.

Classified among the five great growth in 1855. Vineyard
lies on the boundary line of St. Julien. Beautiful example
of outstanding Medoc at relatively modest cost.

594 CHATEAU FOURCAS-HOSTEIN ......-- 4.49 48.50
Important Medoc vineyard recently acquired by a group
of Americans, including our good friend, Frederick
Palmer, a director of the Chemical Bank. Excellent bal-
ance of finesse and flavor.

Classic ‘Grand Cru’ St. Emilion.

125 CHATEAU BOUSCAUT .........-----:+:: 4.99 53.90

child and under the same ownership.

170 CHATEAU FIGEAC .........-----++--+:: 6.99 75.50
One of the ‘greats’ of St. Emilion. Worth much more.

A classic big wine from Pauillac.
130 CARRUADES DE CHATEAU
LAFITE ROTHSCHILD ............---- 12.50 135.00
Crown and chateau-bottled at Lafite Rothschild. The
only difference is that the vines are younger. Chateau
Lafite has abandoned this practice—so soon this truly
great wine will become a collector’s item.

575 CHATEAU LA MISSION HAUT BRION. .12.95 — 139.85
An exalted Graves. In England, it has won the highest
praise from the Wine Writers Circle. Excellent, will live
long.

Consistently obtains the highest prices in the Medoc
outside the ‘first growths.’

The jewel of St. Emilion. As we go to press, the lowest
prevailing wholesale price in Bordeaux is $240.00.

A Pauillac that is destined to outlive us all.

Margaux. What depth and finesse!

455 CHATEAU MOUTON ROTHSCHILD ....21.95 237.00
Despite the fact that the trade replacement cost in Bor-
deaux is over $300, we courageously offer this classic
until our limited inventory is exhausted.

678 CHATEAU PETRUS .......------+:+:::: 29.95 322.45
Very rare—always staggeringly expensive.

215 CHATEAU LAFITE ROTHSCHILD....... 29.95 322.45

the world.

1965 CHATEAU BOTTLED

Here is a year not to be ignored. The wines may be relatively
light, but the nobility of the soil expresses itself in finesse and
balance. However, it is important to be loyal only to those
vineyards that have put the best portion of their harvest under
their label. Each of the 3 listed below is a top-flight thorough-
bred, and if you have the courage to drink an unfashionable
year, the reward will be great in terms of the cost.

No. Bottle Case

174 CHATEAU CALON SEGUR 3.3555. 2.7 3.49 37.70
In St. Estephe, and at a vineyard such as Calon Segur,
the lightness of the year is compensated for by the depth
of the wine. The balance for present.drinking is excellent.

103 CHATEAU HAUT BRION:.:: . .--..... - 6.49 70.10
Chateau Haut Brion is proud of what they produced in
1965, and rightly so. Do not look for great depth—but
look for breed and balance, and delight for present
drinking.

253 CHATEAU LATOUR .........----+-:::: 8.95 96.65
We do not know the secret of how Latour does it—but we
do know that this ’65 will astonish you by its depth and
richness.

1964 CHATEAU BOTTLED

The 1964 vintage is now expressing itself, particularly at the
famed and great vineyards. Here are wines you can enjoy now,
with the happy knowledge that they will still prove delightful
years hence.

7. CHATEAU GAPET. <2. . -2 ccs center e sss 2.89 31.20
A superior St. Emilion. Now has sufficient bottle age to
make it outstanding in taste and in value. Should you
pull the cork and taste it, we suspect you will come back
for more, again and again.

197 CHATEAU GRAND-PONTET ......-.---- 4.49 48.50
A 1964 chateau-bottled Pomerol, (because 90% has al-
ready been consumed) is now classified as a rarity. Here
is a glorious example that we are fortunate to be able
to bring to you.

941i CHATEAU GLORIA ..........2--++++++> 4.79 51.75
A superb St. Julien.
230 CHATEAU CLOS FOURTET .......-.--- 4.99 53.90

A ‘Grand Crw’ St. Emilion—in the style of Cheval Blanc
but a bit lighter.

169 CHATEAU LAFON ROCHET ..........-- 5.49 59.30
Classified Grand Cru St. Estephe in 1855. Superb.

180 CHATEAU DUCRU BEAUCAILLOU ..... 8.49 91.70
Outstanding example of St. Julien.

209 CHATEAU BEYCHEVELLE ...........-- 9.95 107.45

None available in Bordeaux—a few cases still remain in
our cellars.

114 CARRUADES DE CHATEAU

LAFITE BOFTHSCHILD .. ......-....-. 10.95 118.25
What a beautiful example of Pauillac!
273 CHATEAU MARGAUX ...........---+:: 19.95 215.45
The only ‘first growth’ in the commune of Margaux.
460. CHATEUAD TATOUR = =. 2.20 siesta: 19.95 215.45

The wholesale cost in Bordeaux is over $240 the case—
obviously, this offer must be limited to our inventory.

wan ~=6=- GMATEAU HAUT BRION ........55-52+5> 19.95 215.45
Possibly the greatest of the ’64s. Should be acquired now.
899 CHATEAU LAFITE ROTHSCHILD....... 29.95 322.45

A rarity—the price has climbed and climbed and will con-
tinue to climb—if it will be available at all two or three
years hence.

150 CHATEAU MOUTON ROTHSCHILD ....29.95 322.45
Rich, full, great. The most exalted ’64, in our opinion,
of the Medoc.
