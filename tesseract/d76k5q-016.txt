CAREFREE WINES
FROM EVERYWHERE

WINE pre-dates recorded history and is grown almost every-
where. If you are looking for the great wines of the world you
will not find them below. However, you will find—in an age of
spiralling wine prices—several good, satisfying examples that
will not make too serious a dent in the family budget. Some of
these will represent previously untried journeys into wine
drinking—an Odyssey worth undertaking, particularly in the
summer when there is freedom and leisure to move into the
by-paths of the wine world. These wines are not endowed with
fame and recognition—but each will have its own personal
message.

983. RODITYS ROSE (Greece) ...........---- 1.69 18.25
Most of the wines of Greece do not please us, but we have de-

same league with the more costly ones from France.

Austria has given us the gaiety of Vienna...the music of
Strauss...and now they send us their beloved, light-hearted
dry white wine—Gumpoldskirchner.

Full-bodied, deep colored earthy red wine — like a good red
Bordeaux.

take on a $5 Medoc and compete.

a dry, fruity, white wine.

673 BANDA AZUL 1967 (Spain).........----: 2.79 30.15

from where this wine comes. Look for earthy lustiness, honesty
and depth of flavor. A ‘best buy.’

1323 ARCHBISHOP’S MEAD (England)........ 3.49 39.75
King Alfred is reputed to be the founder of Oxford University
and his drink was Mead. This one bears the label of St. Edmund
Hall in the University of Oxford, and is made of raisins and
honey—rather like a first cousin to a sweet Sauternes. Interest-

ing, excellent.

S71. MONT-SUR-ROLLE (Swiss) ......------- 3.85 41.58
This very wine won the Gold Medal in Lucerne in 1954 and the
Gold Medal at ‘Expo ’64.’ In sum, perhaps the best dry white
