wines;. mixes the punch; prepares the ‘Loving Cup’ from an ancient
and secret recipe; and recommends the Sherry. Here is ‘Cyril’s Own’
cream Sherry, the one served at tea-time and prior to the weekly
ordeal of the tutorial. Rich, full, dramatically luxurious, very old,
and the peer of any Cream Sherry on the market.

PORT AND MADEIRA

Bottle Case
SZ Senior Common Room Fine Tawny Port 3.49 39.75

 

The cellars of Oxford are world-renowned for the impeccable
qualities of their Tawny and Vintage Ports. The Port ceremony—
the table is cleared; its mahogany surface is resplendent with fruit,
bowls of nuts, candelabra; Port glasses are lifted, accompanied by the
ritual salute, ‘GENTLEMEN, THE QUEEN.’ This is the very
Port that has been used countless times for such occasions.

-_ S8 Dry Rainwater Madeira 3.79 42.75

ra Mr. R. E. Alton, our Shakespearian scholar and friend at St. Edmund,
reports, ‘Falstaff was said by Poins to have sold his soul for a cup
of Madeira.’ It is probable that Poins was talking about the

rich, heavy, and sweet Bual or Malmsey Madeira. Here, we recom-
mend a Rainwater Madeira which is light, relatively dry and pale.
og bs ot It is often served slightly chilled, as one would a dry Sherry, before
ered, TH dinner. Experts tell us it is the best example of Rainwater produced
on the island of Madeira.

SCOTCH WHISKY
A distinguished example

S1 The Scotch of St. Edmund Hall*

A Scotch Whisky of exceptional balance and rich Havour. It has
delighted undergraduates and Fellows of St. Edmund Hall for
generations. You will sharé their enthusiasm for its harmonious
balance and full maturity. The Oxford scholars, glass in hand, delight
in quoting from Robert Burns, ‘Freedom and whisky gang thegither.’

BRANDY

S2 Pale and Dry English Market Cognac Brandy*

England has a long history of being the world’s most discerning critic
of Brandy. The Oxonian takes it seriously and requires that it be pale,
dry, delicate and of superior finesse. This mature spirit has passed the
rigid St. Edmund test. In the Senior Common Room the learned
scholars delight in a ‘spot of good Cognac’ with their coffee and cigars.

IMPORTED GIN

S3 London Dry Gin*

A superlative spirit distilled at 90 proof, with a flavour approved by
generations of members of St. Edmund Hall. In Oxford, it is drunk
with water and bitters, or with Vermouth. A pure spirit which will do
honour to any long drink, or to Dry Martini.
