BEAUJOLAIS MONTMELAS 1957.

The engaging and increasingly popular light red wines of Burgundy are at their best
when young and are excellent for summer dining. Here is a particularly pleasant
example at delightfully low sale cost.

BEAUJOLAIS, RINGUET, 1955 .

A distinguished Beaujolais that is everything that fine Beaujolais should be—purplish
red, with the fine aroma and taste of crushed grapes. A true discovery.

BEAUJOLAIS BROUILLY 1955, Domaine des Tours i
Beaujolais at its magnificent best; light, refreshing, from one of the best vineyards of
the district.

CHASSAGNE MONTRACHET ROUGE 1957

This surprising wine comes from a top flight vineyard more famous for its whites
than its reds. Here is a red wine of astonishing class—big, sturdy, and full of what
Robert [Louis Stevenson called “soft fire.”

NOUFPs ST. GEGRGES,; LES VAUCKAINS, 1955. . 95 oS.

A beautiful example of deep, full bodied Nuits St. Georges, Estate bottled by Henri
Gouges, the master grower of Nuits.

Sturdy, slow maturing, one of the great red wine vineyards of Burgundy. Glorious
depth and balance—great, great wine.

LA ROMANEE 1953

This tiny two acre vineyard produces the ‘ne plus ultra’ of France’s red wine. An irre-
placeable treasure that merits present acquisition while still available.

BEAUJOLAIS BLANC 1957

Fine dry white wine from the Beaujolais district is rare indeed—here is an intriguing
estate bottled example that will surely delight you.

Our comparative tastings indicate that this is the best 1957 Pouilly we have yet

worth acquiring.

CHABLIS, LES PREUSES, 1955

Here is a wine from one of Chablis’ seven tiny Grand Cru vineyards, estate bottled by
Servin, an exceptional grower. Magnificent.

CORTON CHARLEMAGNE 1955

Perhaps the elusive white wine of all France to come by is Corton Charlemagne
grown in the smallest quantity on the steepest of slopes. You will be delighted by
its depth of flavor, indisputable distinction and subtle bouquet.

CLOS BLANC DE VOUGEOT 1957 .

Estate bottled, Heretier-Guyot j .
A small portion of the Clos Vougeot vineyard, famous for its red wines, 1s oe
