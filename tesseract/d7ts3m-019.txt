From another district, a little to the south of the Gers Département
of Cognac, comes a very palatable and little known brandy esteemed
by the French as a great delicacy. It is second only to the brandy of
Cognac and highly prized by the true connoisseur. The best Arm-
agnac brandies are distilled from Bas-Armagnac wines and are
divided into three classes, known as Grands, Fins, and Petits.

Ancient Normandy is the home of an exquisite apple brandy, the
like of which few American applejack drinkers ever encounter
Really fine Calvados is indeed scarce. It is magnificent when taken
as a liqueur with after-dinner coffee. ‘
