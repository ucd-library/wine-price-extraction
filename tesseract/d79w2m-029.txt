CLARETS OF THE 1962 VINTAGE

No. Bottle Case
350 CHATEAU LOISEAU
(Bardeaux Superienur) .....-........ 1.69 18.25

We first tasted this wine as a luncheon wine at Chateau Haut Brion. It
was light, of good character, and delicious.

368 CHATEAU LA VIEILLE EGLISE
eGisee) 4.79 i945

From the medieval town of Fronsac overlooking the Dordogne River. A

heavy, hearty red wine particularly enjoyed in England. Outstanding
value.

413 CHATEAU LE BOURDIEU

tant WIEOOE) 8 er. 1.589 21.50

One of the smaller bourgeois growths of the Medoc that Chateau-bottles
its own wine. Good character, light, pleasant.

830 CHATEAU SIMARD (St. Emilion) ... 2.79 30.15

Warm, generous, round, the kind of wine that is pleasing while still
relatively young.

598 CHATEAU ROUGET (Pomerol) ..... 2.99 32.30

A true discovery. Of a grand Pomerol class. Excellent depth and much
longevity. Worth much more.

349 CHATEAU MOUTON CADET,
Baron Philippe de Rothschild ....... 3.49 == 37.70

This excellent light red wine is not Chateau-bottled. It is a selection of
Baron Philippe de Rothschild and it proudly bears his name. This is the
last of the 1962 in America and in France. Get it while still available.

439 CHATEAU GAFFELIERE-NAUDES
Getuliog). 3. | es. 3.59 38.75

Many wine authorities believe that this vineyard is surpassed in St.
Emilion only by Chateau Cheval Blanc. Outstanding.

414 CHATEAU LA LAGUNE

(igen Medee) 2.6... ....5 se. 3.69 39.85

This 1962 La Lagune is now the rage of Bordeaux. It is the proud property
of Mr. Chayoux, who has done much in recent years to make it one of
the oustanding vineyards of the Medoc. Because of a relatively high
ratio of merlot grapes, it is one of the most mature of the 1962 Clarets.
Light, and excellent.

570 CHATEAU LYNCH BAGES
eG) a ee aS: 3.99 43.10

A unique Claret. Much heavier, darker, and deeper in flavor than its
neighbors. A smaller version of either Chateau Mouton Rothschild or
Chateau Latour—similar in style.

431 CHATEAU CANTEMERLE
[Macau-Medgc) ..........1 7.2.02... 3.99 43.10

Admirable balance and bouquet. Similar in character to the finer red
wines of the Graves district such as Pape Clement and Bouscaut.

We again quote from the Vintage Chart that appears in the
newly published book ‘Wines and Spirits”.

“1962—quietly, and with a minimum of publicity, the neglected
1962 Clarets have finally won deserved recognition among
the world’s wine-lovers. In their own way, they have some-
thing to offer us. Uniformly, they are excellent, early-matur-
ing, soft, fruity, a fine bouquet and can be enjoyed for present
drinking. Undoubtedly, the best Claret values available today.”

No. Bottle Case
449 CHATEAU MONTROSE (St. Estephe) 3.99 43.10

A great 2nd Growth, 1855 Medoc classification. A slow-to-mature wine
which reached height of quality in 1962. Similar in characteristics to
Chateau Latour. A favorite in England.

708 CHATEAU LEOVILLE LASCASES
(ot julien) «=. = ee 3.99 43.10

One of our favorite Clarets—particularly since 1959 when Dr. Peynaud,
head of the Wine Department of the University of Bordeaux, directed
the production.

103 CHATEAU LASCOMBES (Margaux) . 3.99 43.10
Alexis Lichine is proud of the wine that he produced here in 1962. The
world must have recognized this because it is among the most difficult
of all Clarets to obtain. Great finesse with a bouquet that is described
as ‘reminiscent of violets’.

420 CHATEAU COS D’ESTOURNEL
fob Bategne) 4.29 46.35

Like Chateau Montrose above, this Estephe is hard and slow to develop
in a concentrated year such as 1961. However, in 1962, a superb balance
was achieved.

184 CHATEAU LA MISSION HAUT
BRION (Geaves) 2 6.19 66.85

This great Graves is in the ‘Grand Class’. It is no ordinary event to be
able to obtain such stature, breed and harmony for $6.19.

619 CHATEAU AUSONE (St. Emilion)... 7.99 86.30
We wanted you to taste a great First Growth from an outstanding year

below $10.00 per bottle. We, therefore, priced this excellent Ausone
down to a workable level. You will like it.

147 CHATEAU PETRUS (Pomerol) ...... 9.95 107.45
Achieves more pronounced velvetiness and fruit than any other Claret
whether produced in Medoc, Graves or St. Emilion. Because there are
only 16 acres in total, it is the most difficult of all of the 1st Growths to
obtain. A rarity. Truly magnificent.

202 CHATEAU MOUTON ROTHSCHILD

(Paula) 6 9.95 107.45
Small production—full-bodied—fleshy—rich. The biggest of all of the wines

of the Medoc—long-lasting and the proud property of the Baron Philippe
de Rothschild.

213 CHATEAU LATOUR (Pauillac) ..... 9.95 107.45

About 85% of Chateau Latour is planted with the Cabernet Sauvignon
grape. This partially accounts for its bigness, deep color, slow matura-
tion and long-life. Even its 1870 is still good today.

115 CHATEAU LAFITE ROTHSCHILD

(eelinee) 9.95 107.45
In 1858, Baron James de Rothschild bought Lafite for five million francs.
It is a pride of the Rothschild family and the present Baron Eli spares no
expense in seeing that the quality, disinction and elegance of the Lafite
wines are maintained.

162 CHATEAU HAUT BRION (Graves) .. 9.95 107.45

Owned by the Clarence Dillon family, Chateau Haut Brion has achieved
a supreme position under the loving care of its director, Seymour Weller.
Great power combines with unique subtlety here.
