tasting experience, almost like ‘drinking and smelling a
flower garden.” The TREASURE CELLAR wines repre-
sents the choicest selections and private reserves of the
famed Reichsgraf von Kesselstatt cellars — long-lived
wines that will not only delight now, but will provide joy
for many years ahead.

BEERENAUSLESE means that individual grape berries
have been selected for their over-ripeness at the time of
the picking. The most perfect and ripest bunches are set
aside and pressed separately—a selection, not of bunches,

5108. STEINBERGER CABINET 1959... ....-..... =. 35.00

Estate-bottled, Staatsweingueter.

The most fabulous and expensive white table wines of the world

but of single grapes cut from the bunches by hand with
scissors. They are always sweet, but never cloying, with
a tremendous amount of bouquet, fruit, and flavor.
Should be served only with dessert, or after dinner for

a fabulous tasting experience.

TROCKENBEERENAUSLESE is on an even more ex-
alted level since not only are the grapes picked indidi-
dually by scissors, but they are left on the vines until they
are so ripe that they are dry (trocken), or have almost

become raisins. Fabulous, expensive, great, rare.
