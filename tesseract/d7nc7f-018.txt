SANTA CLARA VALLEY

The better Santa Clara vineyards are located along the foothills
of the Santa Cruz Mountains which tower high above the
valley floor. Because of the need for further plantings, some

of the vignerons have extended their land holdings further to
the south.

ALMADEN VINEYARDS

Almaden was originally founded in 1852 by two Frenchmen
and has since been acquired by National Distillers. Here we
are dealing with the largest producer of varietals in California.

tities of inexpensive, generic table wines. Many are undis-
tinguished, some represent good value for everyday drinking,
and some are eminently satisfying.

much dedication to quality control with an emphasis on low
cost, so it can be enjoyed as an everyday wine.

Although the wine acreage in New York State is but a fraction
of the vineyard land in California, you will find here the same
sense of challenge and dedication to excellence.

BOORDY VINEYARD

While Editor of the Baltimore Sun, Philip Wagner, and his wife
Jocelyn, started a vineyard at their home property in Maryland,
experimenting with European wine grapes. They succeeded to
such an extent, that, in their quest for good vineyard land,
