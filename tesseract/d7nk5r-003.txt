chestnut trees, the newly-polished buildings
and monuments, the colorful spray of the
fountains at night, the bearded students,
the comfortable, cheerful outdoor cafés—
all combined to make us feel young, care-
free and happy that we were in Paris. Our
visits to famed restaurants made it clear
that there are enough affluent Frenchmen
to fill every table, whether it be Tour
d’Argent, Ledoyen, Maxim’s, Taillevent,
Grand Vefour, Lasserre or Laperouse.
Now the vogue among the “‘in food people”
encompasses such restaurants as Chez
Garin, La Bourgogne, Petit Bedon, Grand
Comptoir, Bistrol21, Relais Bisson, Cochon
d’Or, Conconnas, La Mediterranée, Boule
d’Or and that lovely flourishing, little
known bistro, ‘d’Chez Eux’.

The highlight of our Parisian stay was a
visit to the cellars of Nicolas, the world’s
largest wine merchant, just outside of
Paris. The underground corridors seemed
endless—we believe they are a half-mile
long—and there are 8 of them! During
our mile-after-mile walk, inspecting aging
bottles, we were amazed to see endless
rows of Lafite 1868, Mouton 1870,
Margaux 1900, Haut Brion ’18, La Mission
Haut Brion °34, Leoville Lascases °45,
Cheval Blanc °48, and a galaxy of the
great vineyards from 1952 up to the

recent ’64s.

   
  

 

Managing Director, startled us with an
amazing statistic—650,000 bottles, all at
retail, are sold each day in their 1700
outlets—and most is delivered by truck,
right to the home! He explained that the
bulk of this wine is what the average
Frenchman drinks—good, honest, every-
day moderately-priced red and white wine.
But now an increasing percentage of the
well-known classified wines are also in
demand by Parisians who have become
much more knowledgeable, sophisticated
and appreciative. We happily report that
many of the Nicolas treasures have reached
our cellars,

BURGUNDY

Our Simca headed south on the new
autoroute and did not stop until it reached
the Hépital Psychiatrique de 1l’Yonne,
its many acres startlingly situated dead
center in the bustling city of Auxerre. We
met some of the doctors and several of the
900 psychiatric patients. Adjacent to this
historic medieval institution is a 20-acre
vineyard. The vines are grown and culti-
vated by the patients under a cellar master
who is a graduate engineer in viniculture.
The 1966 Vin Rosé grown here was
startlingly good—perhaps the best pink
wine we have encountered in France. It is

And then Mr. Pierre Nicolas, the

 

made exclusively of the Pinot Noir grape
on good Burgundian soil—there is no
better pedigree. A few cases will reach us
during late June.

Patiently, we tasted through the
vineyards of Vosne-Romanée, Gevrey-
Chambertin, Nuits-St. Georges, Aloxe-
Corton and Pommard. Sadly, we report
that the faces of the vignerons, despite
their many recent successes, were longer
than usual. There were fewer smiles.
Though excellent further south in the
Beaujolais and the Rhone—the more
northerly vineyards of the Cotes-de-Beaune
and Cotes-de-Nuits suffered from frost in
the Spring, considerable loss due to
summer hail—followed by disheartening
cold, dreary rainy days just before the
vintage. Most ’67 red Burgundies proved
much too light, lacking in balance and
color.

As for the older Red Burgundies, acquire
the ’66s and lay them away; enjoy the ’64s
which are truly superb and are worthy
successors to the 61s; skip the ’63s; drink
the excellent 62s which are ready now;
treasure the 61s and seek them out, for
not only are they delicious today but will
thrive for many more years; glory in
the 59s.

BEAUJOLAIS

THE wines of Beaujolais are charming and
so are the enthusiastic, ruddy-faced
growers who greet you warmly, ask you to
dine and proudly serve vast quantities of
their excellent fruity wine from the barrel,
and of current vintage. Perhaps the most
intriguing of our hosts in Beaujolais was
the Rt. Hon. Ernest Marples, M.P., proud
of the wine he produces, and enthusiastic
about his recent acquisition, the 15th
Century Chateau. de Chaintré which

 

Halle aux Vins, or Wine Market, Paris
dominates the vineyards of Pouilly-Fuiss¢
from its Maconnais hilltop. We dined well
with our good friend Ernest Marples, and
we are pleased indeed that we have been
able to bring some of his Fleurie, Moulin-
a-Vent, Macon Blanc and Pouilly-Fuissé
to you. As for the vintages in Beaujolais,
the answer is quite simple—if the label
simply reads ‘Beaujolais’ or ‘Beaujolais
Villages’, stick to 1967 and go no further
back (youth and fresh fruit are virtues
here). However, should the label have a
village name such as Fleurie, Morgon, etc.,
stick to 1966 because these wines will
require more age in the bottle. If the
vintage on the label is older than 1966,
you are probably dealing with a Beaujolais
that is showing age and beginning to lose
much of its charm. In Pouilly-Fuissé, 1966
is the only year you should be involved
with at this time. The ’67s will succeed
next year.

BORDEAUX

BoRDEAUX Is to wine what Florence is to
art—a shrine for wine lovers. We breathed,
talked, and drank “Chateau Wines”
during the entire three days we stayed at
Chateau Haut Brion. Using this historic
Chateau as a base, we made side trips to
the prominent vineyards of St. Emilion
and Pomerol—then a pilgrimage to the
Medoc, tasting recent years of Lafite,
Mouton, Rauzan-Segla, Palmer, Margaux,
Beychevelle, Latour, Pichon Longeville
Lalande, Talbot, Lascombes, Lynch Bages
and Calon Segur. It was strenuous—but
we were finally convinced by our own
tasting notes, the comments of the mAitres-
de chais, and the evaluations of the
Bordeaux authorities that what we were
tasting—the 1966 vintage—was truly
great. It is in the classic tradition; well-
balanced; sufficient tannin to indicate
longevity; an ample supply of fruit—the
characteristics of a great year. If one were
to compare it to previous vintages, it is
closest to 1953. It is an expensive year—
the highest price ever demanded by a new
vintage in wine’s history.

As for the 1967s which we tasted every-
where, our notes read: ‘‘very pleasant,
maturing early, not enough tannin to
ensure great longevity but nevertheless a
most useful, pleasant vintage. It doesn’t
