To be honest, we
are inclined to
agree with the

many French wine
experts who
consider Krug
Blanc de Blancs

to be the single
best Champagne
of France. Its
quality is
unsurpassed. The
wine exhibits a
richness and depth
of flavor and an
elegance of
bouquet that
immediately marks
it as extraordinary.
Handsomely
presented in gift
box. (243.50 case)
