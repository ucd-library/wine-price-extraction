 

1975 WHITE BURGUNDY

Unlike red Burgundy that struggled through a
dismal vintage, the ’75 whites emerged healthy,
fruity, fragrant and delicious. Drink these joy-
ously for the next two or three years.

rarities. Estate-bottled, J. N. Gagnard. Avail-
able for delivery October. (#457)

1974 WHITE BURGUNDY

Some superb white Burgundies were produced
in the better wine-growing districts. There is
a freshness, a lightness, and an engaging charm
—the kind of wine that one will love on a boat,
a terrace, a beach or a lawn.

Bottle Case

PINOT CHARDONNAY ........ 2.49 29.50
Even the most desperate of wine cut-raters
cannot produce a wine that can come close to
this in quality and match it in price. We are
proud to offer the best value in good, honesi
wine made of the Pinot Chardonnay grape
from the prolific Macon area. Meras. (#715)
PELM- GCHABEIS: 37. 3.79 43.25
‘Petit Chablis’ does not mean ‘small’; it means
a lighter Chablis, ideal as a carafe wine and is
utterly delightful when served in carafe, par-
ticularly in warm weather. Lasnier. (#409)
GHABEIS 3 ee 3.99 46.75
Chablis is a little town southeast of Paris
which produces the most famous of all white
Burgundies. This wine has character, the pos-
sibility of ageing in bottle, and is vastly
superior to the ‘Petit Chablis’ described above.
Guy Robin. (#422)

GHABEIS 335 a 4.49 51.20
An even better example of Chablis because it
is estate-bottled by R. Vocoret, the long-time
Mayor and dean of Chablis. Available in half
bottles at $54.20 the case. (#410)
POUILLY-FUISSE,

BES GHaAMPS 1% rote ies 4.99 58.50

in the world—top-flight examples now sell for
over $8.00 the bottle because of scarcity. This
one, only $4.99, is the best we have yet tasted.
A real value. Estate-bottled, G. Burrier. (#488)
CHABLIS, LA FORET, 2... . 4.99 58.50
We now step up to a level above simple

classified area. Estate-bottled, R. Vocoret.
(#430)

GHABLIS VAILEONS:........; 4.99 58.50

Chablis. Moillard. (#496)
CHASSAGNE-MONTRACHET .. 5.99 68.50
There is almost no mediocre wine produced in
the township of Chassagne-Montrachet. This
one, estate-bottled by R. Thevenin, the poet
laureate of Burgundy, is a top-flight example.
(#598)

GHABLIS, LES PREUSES...... bd 68.50
Now we are on a higher level than even
‘Premier Cru.’ Les Preuses is a Grand Cru vine-
yard, of which there are only eight. Superb.
Les Vignerons. (#419)

MERRSAULE 2630s. 09, OSs 5.99 68.50
Domaine Matrot is perhaps the best single
grower in this area. A beauty. (#605) as

lent. Moillard. (#663)

PULIGNY-MONTRACHET ..... 7.99 91.10

sidered to produce the finest dry white wine of

AMERICAN CHAMPAGNE

DESCHAMPS BRUT........... 2.99 35.75
Grown in Hudson Valley, bottled fermented.
Outstanding example of fine New York State
Champagne. (#111)

SCHRAMSBERG 1974.......... $66 oodles

A Blanc de Blancs produced in Napa Valley.
Glorious, rationed, and the kind of Champagne
of which America can be proud. (#17)

‘DOMAINE CHANDON LIMIT

NAPA VALLEY BRUT........ 9.29 6 bottles
Moet & Chandon sent their Champagne experts
to the Napa Valley—they chose the best Cham-
pagne grapes and made this amazingly fine
California sparkling wine. It will not reach
New York until November, but is worth wait-
ing for. Suggest you buy 6 bottles now and ‘be
the first in N.Y.’ to taste this happy transplant.

1973 WHITE BURGUNDY

The year was record-breaking. Those who did
not overproduce achieved some glorious wines
magnificent for drinking this summer and a
year or two ahead. We have chosen carefully
to provide you with the best examples.

Botte Gase

SAINT ROMAIN BLANC....... 2.99 35.75
A true discovery! Grown in the hills behind
Meursault, exhibiting the same character, dry,
good depth and balance. We will now put our
neck out. We believe this is the best value in
good, fine white Burgundy in existence any-
where in the United States. Estate-bottled,
Roland Thevenin. (#733)

CUVEE LOUIS LATOUR BLANC 4.79 54.65
LOUIS LATOUR is the King of Burgundy wine-
makers. Here he has chosen Pinot Chardonnay
grapes from some of the best soil of the Cote
de Beaune. It will match outstanding Meur-
saults—in blind tastings, experts have ap-
praised it at good value between $7.00 and
$9.00. If you want character in your dry white
wine drinking this summer, here it is at low
cost. (*622)

PULIGNY-MONTRACHET ..... 5.99 68.50
Another superb wine from the renowned dry
white wine village of Puligny-Montrachet.
Bernard Grivelet. (#397)

MEURSAULT, CASSE TETE.... 6.45 73.50
Not just plain Meursault—but from the excel-
lent vineyard of ‘Casse Tete.’ Estate-bottled,
Roland Thevenin. (*617)
PULIGNY-MONTRACHET,

GHANIOTW 3 ee 7.49 85.40
‘Chaniot’ is one of the Premier Cru vineyards
of Puligny. Beautiful depth and balance.
Estate-bottled, Roland Thevenin. (#759)
CORTON CHARLEMAGNE..... 9.95 113.45
From the steepest vineyard in all of Burgundy.
A dry white of great depth. Bernard Grivelet.
(#433)

BEAUNE, CLOS DES

MOWGHES? 3 223 10.99 118.69
The best-known white of Beaune is Clos des
Mouches. In the hands of M. Drouhin, it is a
minor masterpiece. Rationed. (#626)
CORTON CHARLEMAGNE..... 14.99 170.89
An even more outstanding example of the
heights that can be achieved by Corton Charle-
magne. Will match Montrachet in depth.
Moillard. (#620)
MONTRACHEN 24.95 270.00
Despite its relatively low cost, we think this is
the best 1973 Montrachet we have yet en-
countered. Only eight irreplaceable cases.
Estate-bottled, Roland Thevenin. (#576)

FRENCH SPARKLING
WINE from HAUT
SAVOIE, LOIRE
and BURGUNDY

The most prestigious sparkling wines of France
are produced in Champagne and are called
‘Champagne.’ In other French wine-growing
districts, some superb sparkling wines are
made that can easily compete in intrinsic merit
at half the price. Here are the best.

Bottle Case

REMYORANNIERG 2 33 54 3.99 46.75
From the Loire. Fruitier and less dry than tra-
ditional French Champagne—but excellent.
(#103)

SPARKLING SAUMUR......... 3.99 46.75
De Jessy sends us this noble example from the
Saumur district of the Loire. Drier than the
Remy-Pannier. (#43)

Tetley ees eee Ware... ee, lk 4.79 54.65
Here we pause again. We are dealing with the
best sparkling wine of the Haut Savoie—as dry
as those made in the Champagne district and
almost indistinguishable in style, flavor and
bouquet—a favorite of Craig Claiborne. (#81)
FRAGNY BLANC DE BLANGS.. 5.49 59.50
A superb example of sparkling wine from
Burgundy. (#31)
