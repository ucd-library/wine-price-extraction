FOREWORD

CO Five YEARS HAVE ELAPSED since the advent of repeal.
These years have confirmed our initial belief that an undevi-
ating adherence to a rigid standard of quality and authen-

ticity will ultimately lead to a devoted and satisfied clientele.

It has been our policy to avoid dubious bargains—pre-
ferring to offer only wines and spirits of undisputed origin
and merit. We believe that the list of wines and spirits which
is contained herein is not surpassed anywhere in the city

from the viewpoint of discriminating variety or honest value.

To serve our clients better we have established a Paris
Office at 52, Avenue des Champs Elysées. This enables us to
offer rare wines and spirits which are not generally available.

It further assures minimum price and complete authenticity.

You are cordially invited to visit our shop. You will find

the price of every bottle plainly marked.

Our experienced staff will be pleased to discuss or advise

you concerning your wine and liquor needs.
