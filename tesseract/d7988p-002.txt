A RARE OPPORTUNITY TO ACQUIRE THE GREAT 1953 MOSELLES

“A very great year, possibly even better than 1949, although quite different in character. The
Moselles, instead of being overpowering, are full of astonishing finesse and charm,” says
Frank Schoonmaker in the recently published book ‘The Wines of Germany.’ It is no exag-
geration to state that the better 1953 Moselles command double the price in Germany today.

if one is lucky enough to find them at all, than they did a year ago.

Because of the failure of the 1954 and 1956 vintages, the German wine. grower has
been forced to raise his good 1953s, 60% or more. This price rise must be reflected

this fine Berncasteler now.

609 ZELTINGER HIMMELREICH SPATLESE 1955 (Due Early November) ............... 3.49
Estate Bottled, Ehses-Decker

Nature was kind to the wines of Moselle, for, unlike the Rhine. they were spared the
devastating frost of October 1955. As a result, we can cheerfully look forward to the
1955 Moselles for their lightness and fragrance. The first of these — a topflight estate-
bottling from the town of Zelting — will soon reach our cellars. We were excited about
it when we first tasted it at the vineyard during May—we have every reason to believe
that you will share our enthusiasm.

——< eu. P ~© Lasting a great Erdener of a year like 1953 is an extraordinary wine

experience. The ‘“Treppchen’”’ or * Little Stairway vineyard is unbe-

Estate Bottled, Johann Josef Prum

“7 For many years, the wines from the Sonnenuhr (sundial) vineyard
of Wehlen, have brought the highest prices of any wines of the
Moselle. Here is an-‘‘Auslese” from the best producer of them all.
Beautifully balanced, extraordinary delicacy and depth. We are
indeed proud to have acquired it and be able to offer this Moselle ~
in our opinion, better even than Berncasteler Doktor.
