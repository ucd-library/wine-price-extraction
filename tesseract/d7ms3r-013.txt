SAMPLERS of ‘LOIRE’ and ‘RHONE’ WINES

the 11 Loire white wines listed above, only...... 26.95

RHONE RED WINE SAMPLER — One each of the

The Loire meanders for over 600 miles through France and
wine is grown along its banks from the Atlantic Ocean almost
up to Lyon. Because of the vast area, Loire wines include a
wide and interesting diversity of both whites and reds rang-

ing from the acceptable to the outstanding. Here are the best.
LOIRE VALLEY RED
Bottle Case
CHINON ROUGE 1968 .................... 1.99 21.50

The birthplace of Rabelais yields a light fresh red wine
best when young. Most consumed locally.

SAUMUR CHAMPIGNY 1969 2.79 30.15
Champigny was the favorite of Clemenceau and this red
wine still sells under the slogan “Le tigre en buvait aussi.”

ST. NICOLAS DE BOURGUEIL 2.89 31.20
1969 ae Pano

High up on the Loire hills, the Cabernet Franc grape thrives,

yielding a fruity, fresh, light red wine of distinction. Estate-

bottled, Rutheil-Couly.

LOIRE VALLEY WHITE

NPONTROUIS 1969 oie es 1.79 19.35
Faces Vouvray across the Loire, and almost identical in taste
—except less expensive. Nicolas.

GROSS PUANT 1970 ea 1.79 19.35
Fresh, light, dry white wine grown near the mouth of the
Loire at Nantes. Ideal accompaniment to shellfish. Estate-
bottled, Drouet Freres.

ANJOU BLANC 1969 ......... a ce 1.99 21.50
Astonishing price for a dry white Loire of this estate-bottled
calibre. Lovingly grown and bottled by Savennieres.

MUSCADET BEAUREGARD 1970... 1.99 21.50
From the Beauregard vineyard—the kind of crisp, dry, pale,
and very light Loire wine that is the present rage in the
bistros of Paris. Excellent example.

MUSCADET-SUR-LIE 1970 ............ 2.19 23.65
‘Sur-Lie’ means that the wine never left the original barrel
and the contents were taken out from above leaving the lees
behind. This is a more costly and wasteful process, but the
result is that you get Muscadet with more intense flavor. This
beauty is estate-bottled by Chateau Briacé and won First
Award in a blind tasting among Muscadets that was held
recently in Paris.

MOP VIRAY 1908) 2 ee 2.49 26.90
The cry “Ouvrez le Vouvray” is a refreshing way to greet
the summer season. White, medium dry, much fruit. Nicolas.

ENE 1970 ae a ae 2.59 27.95
A dry white wine of much character. Estate-bottled, Georges
Mounier.

POUILLY BLANC FUME 1969........ 2.99 32.30
Georges Gaudry is the estate-bottler here. Don’t let the rela-
tively low price dissuade you. In truth, this wine makes a
serious bid to being the best single dry white wine produced
in the charming wine town of Pouilly-sur-Loire.

SANCERRE CHAVIGNOL 1970...... 2.99 32.30
Chavignol is famed for its small rounds of goat cheese; it is
equally known for the Sancerre it produces, since it is con-
sidered the best wine commune of the Sancerre area. Estate-
bottled, Vincent Delaporte.

SANCERRE 196%) ree 3.476 40.65
Estate-bottled, Chateau de Sancerre. This is the most famed
and most sought-after vineyard of the district.

POUILLY BLANC FUME 1969....... 4.29 46.35

Here is the very wine featured in outstanding restaurants of
Paris, London and New York. La Doucette.

The Rhone river starts in Switzerland and empties into the
Mediterranean. Red and white wines flourish along its entire
length. The important wine section is south of Lyon and
includes all of the world-famed names listed below.

RED RHONE WINES

Bottle Case
COTES DU RHONE 1967 1.49 16.50

Not to be ignored by anyone interested in drinking good,
sound, honest everyday red wine at a price so low that even
a thrifty Frenchman would express enthusiasm. Here is the
very wine served so proudly at the small country inns that
surround Avignon and Nimes. This 1967 has now acquired
sufficient bottle age to give it softness and bouquet that only
time can impart. Quantity limited and irreplaceable. Also
available in half bottles at 89¢ each, 19.50 the case of 24.
GIGONDAS 2.49 26.90
If vou dine at the Hostellerie de Beaumaniere at Les Baux,
here is the very wine that the Sommelier w ould recommend
to vou. Full bodied, yet surprisingly soft and similar to a
Chateauneuf-du-Pape. Estate-bottled, Union Vinicole.
CROZES HERMITAGE 1967 2.99 27.95
From a vineyard overlooking the Rhone Valley, located
about one mile south of Hermitage. Similar in characteristics
to Hermitage itself, but with a little less depth, maturing
more quickly—however, it is considerably less expensive.
Estate-bottled, Fayalle.

CHATEAUNEUF-DU-PAPE 1969 2.69 29.05
The 1969 vintage proved eminently successful at the Do-
maine de Beaucastel. It is enjoyable for present drinking,
but will be ever better if you put it away in your cellar for a
year or two.

CHATEAUNEUF-DU-PAPE 1967 2.99 32.30
Estate-bottled, Domaine de Beaucastel. Impeccable source.
Sturdy, deep in color, full-bodied, excellent.

CORNAS 1969 2.99 32.30
As far as we know, this is the first time that the sturdy,
delicious red wine of the Cornas vineyards, located 10 miles
north of Hermitage has ever been imported into the United
States. An intriguing ‘gout de terroir’ taste when young, and
we are dealing with a wine that ages well. Estate-bottled,
Auguste Clope.

ST. JOSEPH 1969 2.99 32.30
One bank of the Rhone River produces Hermitage—the
opposite bank produces St. Joseph. The grape varieties and
taste qualities are similar, although the Hermitage generally
reaches more exalted heights. Estate-bottled, Florentin.
CHATEAUNEUF-DU-PAPE 1964 3.39 36.60
Estate-bottled, Domaine de Beaucastel. Here is the same
wine with three additional years of bottle age—hence better
rounded, more subtle.

HERMITAGE 1967 3.69 39.85
Produced on a very steep terraced hillside about 40 miles
south of Lyon. Referred to by Georges Saintsbury as “the
manliest of all wines.” Estate-bottled, Chave.

COTE ROTIE 1967 oe 40.95
Produced at a celebrated vineyard only a five minute drive
south of the famed Pyramide Restaurant in Vienne. The
incredibly steep vineyard faces due south, held up by sturdy
retaining walls, and everything must be cultivated by hand.
Deep in color, full bodied, amazingly long life, and every-
one looks for the aroma of violets when they drink ‘Cote
Rotie.’ Estate-bottled, Gerin.

WHITE RHONE WINES

CHATEAUNEUF-DU-PAPE

BLANC 1969... 2.99 32.30
A rarity—not easy to come by—dry. Estate-bottled, Domaine
de Beaucastel.
HERMITAGE BLANC 1969 3.85 41.60
Estate-bottled, Chante Alouette. Great character, among the
longest lasting of all dry white wines.
CHATEAU GRILLET 1966 16.50 178.20
The rarest wine in all of France. Only 185 cases produced
annually. First importation into America—highly rationed,
dry, unique.
