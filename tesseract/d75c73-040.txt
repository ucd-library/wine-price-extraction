THE RED WINES OF RIOJA (SPAIN)

In a recent issue of House Beautiful, Frank Schoonmaker states, “Even leaving

price oul of consideration, there are, for my taste, no red wines in the world so

fairly comparable to the best of France as the best Riojas.

In the readable, reliable book, “Wine,” Hugh Johnson states, “If I were asked
[ think is the best value for money of any red wine in the world today—I

what “ :
one of the old Reservas—wine fifteen or more years old—but

would say Rioja, S-
which wine merchants persistently ignore.

In the glorious tome entitled “Sherry and the Wines of Spain,” George Rainbird
comments, “The fine wines of the Bodega Federico Paternina are appreciated all
over the world... the bodegas best known wine is the tinto ‘Banda Azul,’ which,
| suppose, would be about 1 years old and is uniformly good and a real giant of
a wine jh Grell Reserva,’ some bottles having a label reading 1928—it can cer
tainly be recommended as a big wine.

And when Frank Schoonmaker told us of the visit of Ernest Hemingway to the
Paternina cellars, we instinctively understood that Mr. Hemingway’s appreciation
basic and flavorsome red wine must have impelled him to seek out the

ot honest, : . : ‘
certainly among the best in all Spain.

Paternina cellars

THE WINES OF PATERNINA... Bottle Bac
673 BANDA AZUL TINTO 1964 (Rioja)........ 1.49 16.10

Ernest Hemingway visited the cellars of Paternina and enjoyed its lusty, flavor-
some red wines enthusiastically. He was accompanied by the famed bullfighter,
Ordonez, during his stay. We are dealing with honest red wine here, rich in
flavor, of good bouquet, and remarkably low priced in relation to its quality.
Frank Schoonmaker concurs with this judgment.

527 GRAN RESERVA 1955. ee 2.99 32.30
Frank Schoonmaker recently visited these Paternina cellars. He was amazed at
the quality of this authentic 1955. We do not think you can find a better wine

at double the price from France.

670 + =GRAN RESERVA 1949 (Rioja)............ 4.99 53.90
As in Bordeaux, 1949 was a great year in Rioja. After all, they are only 250
miles apart and they shared the same superb weather. Great now—and with 10
good years of vitality ahead of it. From the private reserve of Paternina.

456 GRAN RESERVA 1947 (Rioja)....... | 5.99 64.70
The outstanding 1947 clarets command about $200.00 a case in Bordeaux. Our
tasting notes read “classic—remarkable bouquet, well-balanced, sufficient tannin
to indicate longevity. Canecompete with fine old clarets.” Frank Schoonmaker
considers this probably the best red wine procurable in all of Spain.

dry, and excellent white wine for summer drinking.

it in flavor and depth.

district.

466 TOKAY ASZU, 4 PUTTONOS (16 0z.)..-.-- 4.19 45.26
Here is the equivalent of a German “Auslese,” with a high proportion of over-ripe
grapes, which gives it its dramatic, sweet, flower-like bouquet and flavor. It can be
compared to Chateau d’Yquem in taste qualities, but costs less.
