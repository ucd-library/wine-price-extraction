No. Bottle Case

486 CLOS RENE (Pomerol) . 3.49 37.70

The Pomerols were true co in 1961. This wine is not simply a bargain but a “‘steal’”’.
A small 25 acre vineyard renowned for fat, Burgundian-like claret.

619 CHATEAU ROUGET
(Pomerol). . ..... 93.79 40.95

There are only 19 great growths in Pomerol highlighed by Chateau Petrus—and
“Rouget” is one of the great 19. We bought a large existing inventory of this wine at
dramatically low cost—we are passing the entire savings on to you. Were we to replace
this 61 in Bordeaux today, we would have to charge double the price we are offering it
for here. Buy early before it is all gone.

237 CHATEAU BELAIR
GeuMoton). .... 4.49 48.50

There are 12 “First Great Growths” in the 1955 St. Emilion official classification.
Chateau Belair is one of them. The vineyard is owned by Chateau Ausone, the vines
are adjacent, and the wine is matured in the Ausone cellar. The distinction between
Belair and Ausone can be detected only by the most professional taster. Since Chateau
Ausone sells for $13.95 the bottle, our advice is obvious.

595 CHATEAU LYNCH BAGES
Seema, fe ea ae, 4.79 51.75

5th-growth Medoc—originally the property of an Irishman, Mr. Lynch, who was
Mayor of Bordeaux, Rich, full, round.

630 CHATEAU LEOVILLE
LASCASES (St.Julien) .. 4.99 53.90

The vineyard stretches from the town of St. Julien to the borders of Chateau Latour.

Produces almost 20,000 cases of truly excellent wine each year. However in 1961 they

aoe or make only 9,000 cases of truly concentrated, superb, long-lived wine.

288 CHATEAU BRANE
CANTENAC (Margaux) . 5.09 55.00

For a while, this great vineyard, a second-growth Medoc, languished, but under the

dedicated, creative leadership of the proprietor, Lucien Lurton, it has flourished to a

co where its delicacy and softness and bouquet puts it among the first-rank in
argaux.

615 CHATEAU BEYCHEVELLE
hie. .... .. 8.79 $62.66

Proudly owned by M. Achille-Fould, former Minister of Agriculture. The wine has
developed a world reputation for excellence and prestige, thus making it one of the
moat expensive wines of Bordeaux. Please visit the Chateau when you ere in Bordeaux.
It is the prettiest of them all and you will be made welcome.

Clarets

We quote from Sherry’s Vintage
Chart (a new edition will be forth-
coming during early Summer and we
will gladly send you a copy on request)
1961. One of the best years of this
century, especially in St. Emilion and
Pomerol. Unfortunately, the crop
was about half the normal size. But
this weather, during the growing
season, produced’ well-nourished
grapes, resulting in wines with re-
markable color and body. Although
they appeared over-concentrated,
fat, and less charming than the °59s
in early life, they are the most long-
lived wines of our generation and are
truly in the classic tradition of great-
ness. No one who takes his wine cellar
seriously can afford to be without
them.”

114 CHATEAU CALON SEGUR __ Bottle Case
(St.Estephe). . . . . . 5.79 62.55

Quality at the expense of quantity is the standard procedure at Calon Segur. Thus,
the wine is slow to mature, it is perhaps the most long-lived of all, and it has achieved
a special kind of wine immortality in 1961. Since the production is high, fortunately
ag is no real shortage of Calon Segur and therefore the price is not $8 to 10 where
it belongs.

207 CHATEAU MARGAUX
CPA 6 ee is ey 13.50 145.80

A handsome colonnaded Chateau was built in about 1820 by a pupil of Victor Louis,
architect of the Bordeaux Opera House. It is now owned by the Ginestet family who
have restored its magnificence. It ranks with Lafite, Latour, and Haut Brion among
the first four in the 1855 classification. Very elegant, beautifully balanced, relatively
quick to develop, reach great heights in 1961.

158 CHATEAU HAUT BRION
Gives)... se as 13.50 145.80

We share the opinion of many tasters that this is probably the greatest single wine
produced in of Bordeaux during the 1961 vintage. The vineyard is owned by
Clarence Dillon, and his son Douglas Dillon, formerly our Secretary of the Treasury.
It is reigned over in extraordinary fashion and with complete dedication to quality by
the beloved Seymour Weller, one of the most knowledgeable wine authorities of
France. The wine is relatively full, combines power with elegance; and this 1961
promises to live another 50 years.

195 CHATEAU LATOUR
(Peete) 6k ks. 13.95 150.00

Montaigne, a citizen of Bordeaux, spoke about Chateau Latour in his “essays”. In
1963, the dominant owner became Lord Cowdray, one of England’s prime social and
financial figures. The vineyards and cellars have been brought into perfect shape by
Henri Martin, the Mayor of St. Julien and the President of the Bordeaux Wine
gpenapgeewcl dams 1961 is firm, rich, noble, and requires some more aging to bring out
its true worth.

218 CHATEAU MOUTON
ROTHSCHILD (Pauillac) . 15.95 172.50

The name, Mouton, is evidently based on the fact that Moutons, or sheep, grazed on
the property (that is where the expression ‘‘Pauillac lamb” was born). It is now owned
by the brilliant Baron Philippe de Rothschild who devotes as much time to the vine-
yard as he does to his poetry and museum. Since it is made exclusively of cabernet
sauvignon grapes, the wine is long-lived. Relatively heavy, exceptionally full, with
dramatic bouquet.

203 CHATEAU LAFITE
ROTHSCHILD (Pauillac) . 19.95 215.00

Don’t let this price shock you. This wine costs more than this today to replace in
Bordeaux. Many consider Lafite the eae single red wine vineyard in the world.
It is owned by Baron Hlie de Rothschild, the cousin of Philippe who reigns at Mouton.
A special kind of friendly wine competition has resulted between them. Lafite has
great finesse, a unique softness, delicacy, with the breed of a thoroughbred racehorse—
in contrast to Mouton where weight, depth and power are the distinguishing
characteristics,
