THE LAST TIME AT $3.99—the J. T. S. Brown Distillery has advised
us of a substantial price increase that will take effect with our next
shipment. While our present inventory remains, we continue to offer
this remarkable Bonded Bourbon, Kentucky’s best seller, at the
sensationally low price of $3.99 the Fifth.

THE LAST OF THE “8 YEAR OLD”’—though the front label reads
6 Years Old, the Federal strip stamp on each bottle in our cellars in-

dicates the true age and reads:—‘‘Made Fall 1950—Bottled Spring
1959”—814 YEARS OLD!

487 COTES DU RHONE ROUGE 1955 . .  — .. 2.1.39 15.50

A consistent favorite among our clientele — good depth and balance; rich in the typical Rhone Valley
flavor; exceptionally fine red wine at extraordinarily low cost.

 

420 CHATEAUNEUF DU PAPE 1955 (Clos des Felibres) . .2.19 24.50

This vineyard, one of the most remarkable and dramatic of France, towers high above the town
where one can hardly see soil because of the large rock boulders. It is generally conceded among the
citizens of Chateauneuf that the best wine of their district comes from this eagle’s nest vineyard.
