MULTITUDE OF SINS
The anathema of all sound
Champagne-drinking Britishers
is a sweet Champagne — “out,
out”’ they cry, even if it is slightly
sweet. This may account for
their dry humor! At any rate the
term English Market when ap-
plied to champagne means a
light, clean, bone (we repeat,
bone) dry wine produced in the

 

Champagne district with the
least possible amount of sugar
dosage added. We urge you to try
a bottle or two of Fortnum &
Mason carefully selected Eng-
lish Market Brut 1949 at $4.99
the bottle, ($56.50 the case).

FHE DIGGINTTY-OF

SERVICE
With a quiet friendly assurance
that you could buy none better
(and at a price equal to any other
yood store), the morning-coated
assistant in Fortnum & Mason’s
fabulous grocery department es-
tablishes the close understanding
that exists between clerk and
customer in a store which has
created dignity without pom-
posity.

Whether you are a Queen, a
Bishop, a film star or just plain
Mr. Smith, your welcome at
Fortnum & Mason’s will be
warm, sincere and unflurried.

Of all the thirty-seven famous
departments none quite equals
the broad canvas covered by the
food stuffs. The ghosts of Mr.
Fortnum and Mr. Mason must
be truly proud to pace this world
market of every conceivable
produce. In or out of season —
rare or commonplace—costly or
Inexpensive — known or un-
known, you'll find it in this pal-
ace of the gourmets. The dignity
of service which the visitor ex-
periences at all times is bred
from the pride in working for
this landmark of luxury, which
supplies the needs of the discrim-
inating, far and wide.

BELOW DECKS
Biased as we are at Sherry’s, the
wine crypt below Fortnum &
Mason has our special interest.
Its impresario is a Mr. Polley
(assisted by an able staff) ; there
to help advise customers with an
honesty that is impressive.
Whether you intend laying down
a cellar or wish to buy a dollar
bottle of ‘vin de table,’ Mr. Pol-
ley, who has devoted his life to
the study of ‘la raisin,’ will be
only too happy to assist you —
but he will always tell you “let
your palate be your final guide’!
Mr. Polley believes that enjoy-
ment of the grape is all that
really matters and fiddlesticks to
any mystery or formula as to
what the rules should be.

 

The American visitor who
feels he may be leaving behind
him something he relishes from
his visit to Fortnum & Mason’s
will find on his return to New
York the same measure of serv-
ice, friendliness and personal at-
tention in our shop (Sherry’s)
on Madison Avenue, where the
wines and spirits of Fortnum’s
will greet him once again.
