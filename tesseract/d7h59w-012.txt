Rare, Irreplaceable

Vintage MADEIRA

From the
Last Century

“The very existence, let alone the sheer perfection of these
vintage Madeiras, is an historic wine event—these 19th
Century Madeira have provided one of the great wine
tasting experiences of my life,” states James Beard.

Here is an unusual offering of remarkable, authentic 19th
Century Vintage Madeiras. Each bottle (except the three
Soleras) is signed by a director of the impeccable firm of
Blandy certifying that the bottle contains a genuine Ma-
deira of the vintage stated. Most of these vintage Madeiras
have disappeared from our cellars, but these thoroughbreds
remain. We suggest the acquisition of these precious bot-
tles while they are on sale during this period.
