The 15 Yr. Old “Royal Ages” Scotch
of

Is Now Available in Rationed Quantity

In Time to Send as a Distinguished

WHEN JUSTERINI & BROOKS opened their doors in 1749,
the war of the Austrian Succession had ended, England was
recovering from the Jacobite uprising, Bonnie Prince Charlie
had invaded England; in distant India and the Americas there
was continual friction between the British and French Colo-
nists, and Samuel Johnson conversationally dominated the
Coffee Houses of London. Justerini & Brooks has been privi-
leged to serve through ten reigns of English sovereignty and
even today proudly carries the grant “By Appointment to Her
Majesty, The Queen.” It is out of this heritage of Justerini &
Brooks that this noble 15 Year Old Scotch ‘Royal Ages” has
been born.
