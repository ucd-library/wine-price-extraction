Here are authentic wines of a previous period—treasures that have survived
the wine merchants’ need to sell and the wine lover’s impulse to open the cork.
Everyone of these has started as a great wine and has been permitted to reach
its full maturation in bottle. Commercially they are non-existent and their
acquisition is not far removed from the art collector’s search for a rare painting.

 
   
     
 
  

Tasting any of these wines can provide an aesthetic experience for the sensitive

 
 

palate quite in the same league as listening to a good concert or watching a

 
 

Shakespearean play well performed.
