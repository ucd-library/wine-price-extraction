WHITE BURGUNDY

We suggest buying in’78—1979 will not be a happy year economically
for those who are fond of the good white wines of Burgundy. The cost of
a fine Macon Pinot Chardonnay 1978 will be so high at the vineyard,
that it will retail for about $7.00 the bottle; a good Pouilly-Fuisse over
$10.00; Puligny-Montrachet about $18.00; and believe it or not
Batard-Montrachet will be hard to come by even at $30.00 the bottle!
The economic lesson is obvious

1977 VINTAGE

Dryness and austerity are the dominating features less fruit than in

v must be chosen
