THE MOST REMARKABLE COGNAC OF FRANCE

9.45 108.00

Here is an Estate-bottled Cognac that was produced during a great vintage year (1929) in the most celebrated
part of the Cognac country, “Grand Fine Champagne”. It has remained in its unblended state in barrels from 1929
until the present date. Cognac of this calibre is difficult to obtain because no more than a few small growers have
the patience and aptitude to put aside, year after year, a distillation of their outstanding vintages.

Since the early 19th century it has been the custom of the Hine Family to set aside

the best Cognac produced during a particularly outstanding year for their own
future use—ultimately this old precious reserve is served to honored guests on spe-
cial occasions, For the first time, Francois Hine, managing director of this venerable
firm, has consented to part with a few of these treasured bottles—each is numbered
and bears a back label relating the unique history of the contents, hand-signed by a
Hine director—the entire shipment is less than 300 bottles.

For those who wish to experience a Cognac laid down in the mid-nineteenth cen-
tury, we know of no better example—particularly suitable as an exciting Christmas

gift to an appreciative friend.
