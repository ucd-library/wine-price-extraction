NOILLY PRAT

We all know the excellence of NOILLY PRAT Extra Dry
Vermouth from France—and now France sends us, the
superb NojHy Prat Sweet Vermouth.

Noilly Prat is the classic dry French Vermouth by which
all other Vermouths are judged. It is pale, extra dry, of
impeccable origin, and renowned through the world. It is
the ideal companion for the Dry Martini—also excellent
on-the-rocks with a twist of lemon peel.

Its delightful counterpart—Noilly Prat Sweet Vermouth
from France—is now available. You will be delighted with
its fruity richness and beautiful balance. (36.18 case)
