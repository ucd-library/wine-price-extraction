Audubon drew it...
the great, golden
bronze bird...so
American that
Benjamin Franklin
urged its adoption
as our national
symbol...can out-
run a galloping
horse...hunters
testify to its sagac-
ity... the Tom wild
turkey is the undis-
puted master of his
harem... civiliza-
tion encroached,
and not too many
remain in the land
... but we happily
report that WILD
TURKEY BOURBON is still among us — ready to add its dis-
tinction to your own drinking — and its uniqueness to your gift-
giving. (Below 7102.50 case).
