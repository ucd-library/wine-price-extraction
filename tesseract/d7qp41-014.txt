RED WINES FROM THE RHONE VALLEY...

No. Bottle Case

813 COTES DU RHONE ROUGE 1968 (Nicolas) . 1.29 13.95
The kind of heartwarming red wine you get at the better inns of the Van Gogh
country surrounding Avignon.

388 CROZES HERMITAGE 1968 (Nicolas) 1.99 21.50
A “Best Buy.” The wonderfully deep, ricl red wine character of Hermitage and
at half the price.

569 CHATEAUNEUF DU PAPE 1964 (Felibres) . 2.49 26.90
From an eagle’s nest of a vineyard towering above the town. Some say it is the
best in the entire area.

492 CHATEAUNEUF DU PAPE 1961 .......- 3.49 37.70
From the superb Felibres vineyard on a high plateau dominating the valley.
Crimson in color, full-bodied, without dullness, soft. Ready now.

623 COTE ROTIE 1966 (B. Thierry) ...... 3.49 37.70
Generous, rich in color and with a taste of truffles and raspberries. This may
partially explain the name ‘roasted slope.’ The slope is steep, mechanization is
impossible—hence the vineyards are shrinking because labor is scarce.

WHITE WINES FROM THE RHONE VALLEY...
470 ST. PERAY 1966....... 2.79 30.15

The favorite wine of France’s Second Empire (1852-1870) —now only beginning
to come back into favor. This dry, pleasant white wine is grown on cliffs over-
looking the Rhone Valley’s right bank.

484. CHATEAUNEUF DU PAPE BLANC 1966. . 2.99 32.30
An intriguing white wine of the Rhone—not easy to come by. Deep in flavor,
much character, and with an individual taste of its own.

823 HERMITAGE BLANC 1964 (Noyer) .. .- 3.89 42.00
More red wine than white wine is produced in Hermitage—however, the white is
excellent, dry, delicate and well endowed with body and bouquet.

693 CONDRIEU, CHATEAU DU ROZAY 1966. . 5.99 64.70
Dry, robust, perfumed and fruity with distinctive bouquet. Featured at la Pyra-
mide.

441 CHATEAU GRILLET 1966.........- 16.50 178.20
The rarest wine in France. Total production is only 180 cases per year. Full-
bodied, golden, dry—like no other wine.

 

 

THE RED WINES OF RIOJA (SPAIN)

In a recent issue of House Beautiful, Frank Schoonmaker states, “Even leaving
price out of consideration, there are, for my taste, no red wines in the world so
fairly comparable to the best of France as the best Riojas.”

And when Frank Schoonmaker told us of the visit Ernest Hemingway to the
Paternina cellars, we instinctively understood that Mr. Hemingway’s appreciation
of honest, basic and flavorsome red wine must have impelled him to seek out the
Paternina cellars—certainly among the best five in all of Spain.

Don’t let the low price that these wines command discourage you. They are gen-
uinely and intrinsically good. The taste of a single bottle will reassure you—
experiencing, with your friends the contents of an entire case will make it a
certainty. It required much persuasion to obtain the 1949 and 1947; and we think
it would be wine wise of you to consume, now, the ’55 and ’64 if you want
genuinely good red wine at low cost.

THE WINES OF PATERNINA...
673 BANDA AZUL TINTO 1964 (Rioja) .. - 1.49 16.10

Ernest Hemingway visited the cellars of Paternina and enjoyed its lusty, flavor-
some red wines enthusiastically. He was accompanied by the famed bullfighter,
Ordonez, during his stay. We are dealing with honest red wine here, rich in flavor,

of good bouquet, and remarkably low priced in relation to its quality. Frank
Schoonmaker concurs with this judgment.
527 GRAN RESERVA 1955 .....-.-- oe 2.88. 22.30

Frank Schoonmaker recently visited these Paternina cellars. He was amazed at
the quality of this authentic 1955. We do not think you can find a better wine at
double the price from France.

670 GRAN RESERVA 1949 (Rioja) ....- 4.99 53.90
As in Bordeaux, 1949 was a great year in Rioja. After all, they are only 250 miles
apart and they shared the same superb weather. Great now—and with 10 good
years of vitality ahead of it. From the private reserve of Paternina.

456 GRAN RESERVA 1947 (Rioja) ..-+-+-+-> 5.99 64.70

The outstanding 1947 clarets command about $200.00 a case in Bordeaux. Our
tasting notes read “classic—remarkable bouquet, well-balanced, sufficient tannin
to indicate longevity. Can compete with fine old clarets.” Only a few cases remain
—Frank Schoonmaker considers this probably the best red wine
all of Spain.

THE WINES OF SWITZERLAND...

The Neuchatels, Dezaley, and Doles now fetch over $3.00 the bottle on the world
market. By acquiring one of the best Neuchatels of Switzerland in large quantity,
we are able to roll the price back to where we think it belongs—just below $2.00
the bottle.

No. Bottle Case

488 NEUCHATEL, BEAUREGARD 1967..... 1.99 21.95
Normally $2.75. The dry, crisp, refreshing mountain background is reflected in
this white wine.

ALSATIAN WINES...

780 SYLVANER 1967 (St. Odile) .....-++-e-s 1.69 18.25
Fresh, light, delightful and of high drinkability.
757 RIESLING ST. ODILE 1967 .....-+-+--s 1.99 21.50

A truly dry white of unusual charm and at a price that permits carefree serving.

718-7 GEWURZTRAMINER CRU ST. ODILE 1967 2-49 26.90
This wine was first served us by Jean Calvet of Bordeaux. We were enthusiastic,
and he quietly made it possible for us to bring this outstanding white wine to our
clientele. You will share our sense of discovery.

887 GEWURZTRAMINER GRAND CRU 1966... 3.29 35.30
F. Hugel is to Alsace what a ‘First Growth’ is to Bordeaux.
490 CLOS STE. HUNE RIESLING 1967..... 3.49 37.70

Clos Ste. Hune, because of its pre-eminence is the only Alsatian wine that is being
served at the State Banquets held at the Palais d’Elysees, the residence of the
Presidents of France. It was served proudly at the official dinner given by General
de Gaulle in 1969, honoring the visit of President Richard Nixon. Our supply is
limited and irreplaceable.

THE WINES OF AMERICA

With each passing year, the excellence of the wine produced on our native soil is
improving in dramatic fashion. The red wines of California, and some of the white
wines produced in the east, have earned high praise and recognition from the
world’s leading wine experts, including those of France, Germany and England.
Below are outstanding examples from some of the better vineyards employing
superior grape varieties.

THE RED WINES OF AMERICA...
888 NAPA GAMAY 1967 (Mondavi) ....-+-+-> 1.99 21.50

Here is the grape used to make Beaujolais expressing itself beautifully in the
Napa Valley soil of northern California. Excellent.

927 MT. ZINFANDEL (L. Martini) ..... os «eae fate
‘Zinfandel’ is America’s answer to ‘Beaujolais’—fruity, quick-maturing red wine
to be consumed joyously and easily.

903 PINOT NOIR (Almaden) ......-+-+-+--s 2.29 24.78
In California, the Almaden vineyard has devoted goodly acreage to the production
of Pinot Noir, the grape that produces the great red Burgundies.

912 CABERNET SAUVIGNON 1966 (Beaulieu) . 2.88 31.14
Attention here! This grape, which produces the great wines of Boi deaux, finds
supreme expression at the Beaulieu vineyard of Napa Valley. Deserves to be put
away for another year or two, if you want to experience American red wine at its
best.

984. BULLY HILL 1967 (Finger Lakes)... 2.98 35.18
This tiny vineyard, surrounding a wine museum, is owned by Mr. Taylor, Dean of
the vignerons of the Finger Lakes area. If you are skeptical about the possibility
of producing truly fine red wine in New York State, look no further—here is
evidence enough!

THE WHITE WINES OF AMERICA...
929 MOUNTAIN WHITE (Almaden)... .- 1.35 14.58

Young, refreshing—from some of California’s best northern soil.

g
974 BLANC DE BLANCS (Wente Bros.) .. - 2.21 23.87
Here is California’s answer to the fresh, fruity dry white wines of the Loire. There
is a beautiful balance between the dry freshness and fruit. Some consider this the
most successful dry white wine of all California.

879 CHENIN BLANC 1966 (Mondavi) ...-.--> 2.29 24.73
This grape, the basic one of the Loire does exceedingly well in Napa Valley.
Fresh, pale, and with considerable finesse.

945 HIGH TOR WHITE 1967 ... 2.40 25.92
Within half an hours drive from Columbus Circle, towering above the Hudson,
there is a beautiful vineyard that produces this refreshing, surprisingly good dry
white wine.

936 PINOT CHARDONNAY (Beaulieu) ....-.- 3.70 39.96

If you are looking for the Montrachet of California, you will find it here.
