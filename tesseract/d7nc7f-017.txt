BEAULIEU VINEYARD

Visiting Beaulieu Vineyard is not far removed from visiting a
great Chateau in Bordeaux. You will discover a beautiful turn-
of-the-century house, classic gardens, and great wines in the
cellar. The vineyard was established in 1900 by a Frenchman,
Georges de Latour, and here are red wines that are surely
worth laying down.

Joe Heitz is to California what the Domaine de la Romanee-
Conti is to Burgundy—small, dedicated to the making of great
wine, expensive, but worth the cost.

INGLENOOK VINEYARDS

Inglenook was founded in 1879 by a colorful Finnish seafarer,
Captain Niebaum. The family title subsequently passed on to
John Daniel. And then in 1964, this historic vineyard was
acquired by Heublein. The wines are excellent.

SOUVERAIN

Back in 1943, Lee Stewart, a wine lover, decided to enter the
wine business. He fell in love with an area, not far from St.
Helena, above the Silverado Trail. It started as a hobby, but
kept expanding. Only recently, Frank Schoonmaker became
associated with this beautiful vineyard dedicated to excellence.

LIVERMORE VALLEY

Because of its 30 mile width, Livermore looks rather like a
wild, rolling plain than valley country. Like Germany and
Bordeaux, the soil appears coarse and gravelly. These condi-
tions are peculiarly adapted to the cultivation of good white
wines.

WENTE BROS.

The Wente family came to this country from Germany during

the early ’80s, studied viniculture and started this remarkable
vineyard.
