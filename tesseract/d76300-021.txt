EDITOR’S NOTE: Many of you are
familiar with James Beard by chatting
with him in the shop, or have read his
books “Paris Cuisine’? and “The Fire-

another member of Sherry’s staff, Sam
Aaron, he has just completed “HOW

Food and drink never seem to taste quite
as good as they do when dining on a
terrace, or under a shade tree, or in the
city after a pleasant stroll in the park,
or along the Avenue. At this time of
year, no other drink is quite as tradi-
tional or as cooling as a Mint Julep and
none quite takes its place in respect to
flavor. There is something about the
blending of fresh mint and good Bour-
bon that spells “coolth”. With the won-
derful Old Jeb Kentucky Bourbon now

3.69 the bottle, no one can now point
to high cost as the objection to serving
a Mint Julep. So let’s just for the record
repeat that time honored recipe.

MINT JULEP

First of all, I see to it that I have plenty
of finely-pounded ice. I start about
forty minutes before I serve the Julep
by crushing six or seven leaves of fresh
mint with a teaspoonful of powdered
sugar in each glass. I then pack each
glass with ice and pour over enough
Bourbon to reach almost to the rim
of the glass. Then, with a long-handled
spoon, I stir, stir, stir, until the glass
begins to frost. At this point I add
enough ice to reach to the top of the
glass and place the drinks in the
refrigerator to mellow for twenty to

 

twenty-five minutes. When I remove
them, if there is room, I float a little
more Bourbon on the top and add a
sprig of mint, well dusted with pow-
dered sugar. This provides one of the
pleasantest summer refreshers I know
of. Repeat as often as deemed wise.

MEMORY REFRESHING

Almost everyone is ‘convinced that he
has the perfect method of grilling a
steak over a charcoal fire, but I thought
a few reminders might not be amiss.
The first thing to remember when you're
buying a steak for your outdoor grill is
never to buy one under an inch and a

      
  
  
  
   
   
   
   
  
   
    
  
 
  
      
     
    
  
 
 
  
  
  
 
 
  
   
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
  
  
 
  
  
  
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
       

quarter or an inch and a half thick—two
inches is even better — and be certain
you get one with plenty of fat which
should look somewhat like white marble.
And again, if you are buying chopped
meat to cook outdoors, get, contrarily
speaking, lean meat, well ground. Chops,
too, should be thick and well edged with
fat. Always keep in mind, in spite of
appetite pressure, that the best results
in outdoor cooking come from glowing
coals and never from the blazing fire.
Your guests will enjoy waiting if you
serve them pleasant summer drinks and
one or two things for munching. Here
is a neat little trick which Helen Evans
Brown and I worked out while prepar-
ing our “Complete Book of Outdoor
Cookery”:

Spread thin slices of well-textured firm
bread with freshly ground beef of about
14% inch thick — sprinkle well with salt
and pepper and top with another slice.
Toast well on both sides over your out-
door charcoal fire, or in the rotisserie
or oven. When the bread becomes well
toasted, the meat will be cooked to a
degree of rareness and heat that will
make it toothsome and delicious. Cut
into squares for eating. Have plenty of
them around, with appropriate drinks,
for the rate at which they tempt the
palate is amazing.

WORDS OF ADVICE

I know of no more glorious way to bid
fond farewell to the chill blasts of win-
ter than with a bottle of the lean, deli-
cate, pleasing Swiss Neuchatel 1953
(costs only 1.29) ...or any better way
to demonstrate good spring cheer than
lifting a glass-of Fortnum & Mason
Scotch Whisky ... for those who want
Spain’s finest wines at unbelievably low
cost, do not overlook the amazing sale
of Wisdom & Warter’s Sherries de-
scribed on page 4... nor should you
let any of your friends sail to Europe
without sending them at least one bottle
of Champagne iced in “Le Can-Can’...
