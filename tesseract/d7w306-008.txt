NO. BOTTLE CASE Here is an extraordinary opportunity to acquire the
676 GRAACHER MUNZEAY 5% he ee 2.19 23.65 great wines of the Moselle and Rhine at savings up

 
 

to 50% below the current market. Choose among
such world-famous growers as Dr. H. Thanisch, Egon
Muller, Joh. Jos. Prum, von Kesselstatt, von Schu-

bert, Staatsdomaine, Prince von Metternich and
Graf Matuschka.

long-lived 59s and sprightly 64s. Since many of these
wines will surely be depleted rapidly, and are irre-
placeable at these prices, we advise ordering early
and anticipating your Spring and Summer require-
ments now.
