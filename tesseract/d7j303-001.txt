es hroughout the centuries, the traditional shops of London have preserved
their unique character and responsibility, making this ancient city the most
regarded shopping centre of the world. And even here in London, no other
street has quite achieved the fame and distinction enjoyed by Piccadilly. Our
happy lot at FORTNUM & MASON, as one of its oldest inhabitants, has been a
continuous responsibility to quality, service and the ever increasing demands of
a critical, international clientele.

We have been privileged to “hold the fort” for 250 glorious years — today we face
an exciting and challenging future, knowing that our customers have demonstrated
their support of us as resolutely as we have engaged their attention. You who live
in America have, in your own great and vibrant city of New York, an outpost for
our cellar treasures, zealously presented by our old and good friends SHERRY

WINE & SPIRITS CO., INC. at 679 Madison Avenue.

We commend to your serious attention their very attractive shop, where you will

find a little part of Piccadilly devoted to the display of the best we have to offer

you among our wines and spirits.

THE BLESSING OF
FIVE CENTURIES —

MX

CQ herry, an anglicization of Jerez, comes from the
SN) world famous vineyards around the Andalusian
I town of Jerez de la Frontera in Spain and dates
back some 2,500 years. For five centuries the English and
the Spaniards have worked and collaborated to produce
this most versatile wine.

Like all great shipping houses, FORTNUM & MASON
blends its Sherries to its own particular style. These
blends, the pride of our experts, have evolved over the
years to bring out the most desirable characteristics of
the two classic Sherry types.

The blessedness of the unique and versatile Palomino
grape is governed by the mystery of its first fermentation
— whether it decides to become fino or oloroso — it is,
however,the long learnt skill of the solera system and
the patient blending that achieve the perfect wine.

From these two basic types are developed the glorious
range of Sherries — very dry to very sweet — wines to
suit every occasion or taste.

In England, we welcome you with Sherry, we bless your
feast with Sherry, indulge your relaxation with Sherry
and finally wish you “God speed” with Sherry.
