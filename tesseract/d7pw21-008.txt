For Those
Who Love
Food @ Wine

Important

Book!

Many of the delightful photo-
graphs which you see throughout
our brochure are but a small part
of the photographic profile of
France and the United States
which appear in the two wonder-
fully-illustrated and recently-
published cook books, SAM-
PLER OF AMERICAN COOK-
ING and THE FLAVOR OF
FRANCE. These were prepared
out of the profound knowledge
and loving care of the Chamber-
lain family.

‘The text is the work of the charm-
ing Mrs. Chamberlain and _ her
handsome, well-informed daugh-
ter. ‘The pictures mark a high
point of the internationally-fa-
mous and brilliant photographic
career of Samuel Chamberlain.
Many of you may know his aston-
ishingly fine work from “Bouquet
de France,” Italian Bouquet”
and the annual Chamberlain
calendars that cover New Eng-
land, Italy and France.

Acquire THE FLAVOR OF
FRANCE for a delightful tour
through French Chateaux vil-
lages and country roads—and for
those who wish to see some of the
greatest photographs ever taken
of the regional United States, we
strongly advise that you quickly
get a copy of SAMPLER OF
AMERICAN COOKING. Both
are studded with classic, as well as
original recipes representing the
various regions involved, whether
they be in France or in America.

For your copy, simply write the
publishers, Hasting House, Inc.,
Port Washington, New York...
the book will be mailed to you
immediately. The invoice ($5.95,
modest indeed!) will follow later.
