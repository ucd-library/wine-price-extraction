to love the lady known as Vouvray,
for example, and I gladly surrender
all rosé wines to their admirers.
Yes, we have had our ups and
downs, wine and I, our misunder-
standings and our reconciliations,
our delights and our discords. On
the whole however I think of our-
selves as a model couple: faithful,
mutually solicitous, still ardent,
and, in the case of the lady, well-
preserved.

The record of our union is con-
tained in my Cellar Book, the earli-
est entry being that of October 17,
1935 at which time I seem to have
laid down a dozen Morey, Clos des
Lambrays °29 at a price ($28) that
today induces wistful dreams. ‘‘Quite
beautiful” is the notation under
“Remarks”: vague phrasing, but
from the heart. The day before yes-
terday I binned three cases that for
some years had been maturing their
charms for my special benefit: Vol-
nay, Clos des Ducs °43; Niersteiner
Rehbach °43 (which may be foo ma-
ture—it is such delicate uncertain-
ties that give to wine drinking what
hazards give to golf); and Piesporter
Goldtrépfchen Schloss Marienlay
’47. Between these two entries lies a
third of a lifetime of adventures,
each one drawn by the twist of a
corkscrew from its horizontal tor-
por in the dim cellar to the vivid life
awaiting it within the clear glass.

The drinking of wine seems to me
to have a moral edge over many
other pleasures and hobbies in that
it promotes love of one’s neighbor.
As a general thing it is not a lone oc-
cupation. A bottle of wine begs to
be shared; I have never met a mi-
serly wine lover. The social emo-
tions it generates are equidistant
from the philatelist’s solitary gloat-
ing and the football fan’s gregarious
hysteria.

“Wine was not invented,” says
J. M. Scott. “It was born. Man has
done no more than learn to edu-
cate it.” In other words, wine is
alive, and when you offer it to your
fellow man you are offering him life.
More than that, you are calling out
more life in him, you are engaging
in what might be called creative
flattery, for you are asking him to
summon up his powers of discrim-
ination, to exercise his taste, or per-

 

haps merely to evince curiosity or a
desire to learn.

That is why there are few better
gifts to send a newly married couple
than a case or two—or a bottle or
two—of wine. It is not that, when
drinking it, they will recall the
donor—if you crave such vulgar
satisfactions it is more efficient to
send them a chair with a pair of
spurs set in the upholstery. It is that,
when drinking it, they will become
more conscious of themselves, of
their own capacity for joy. I doubt
that you get the same result from a
toaster.

It is for this reason that men of a
wiser generation than ours left wine
to their sons after their death. I can-
not leave much, but I have care-
fully seen to it that I own more wine
than Ican possibly drink before I die.
What good will three thousand dull
dollars, which can at best yield five
or six per cent, do my son as com-
pared with 1200 inherited bottles of
wine, guaranteed to generate cheer
and laughter and good talk long
after my last swallow?

But, if such considerations seem
too rarefied, I retreat to my last line
of defense, that of enlightened self-
ishness. I heard once, or perhaps
read somewhere, that the palate is
among the last of our organs to de-
cay. I do not know whether this is
so; I am not so great a fool as to
hand over to the Inquisition of sci-
ence a statement that has all the
marks of a self-evident truth. Yes,
our muscles give way at last to grav-
ity’s quiet, resistless pull; the best,
the most joyful of our glands, in the
end withers; the eye, the ear lose
some of their fine quick power to
seize upon the world; the limbs be-
gin to ask, What’s the hurry? but I
know men of eighty whose infirmi-
ties for the brief space of a bottle’s
emptying vanish as they sip their
wine, their taste buds as lively as
when they were one-and-twenty—
nay, livelier. The pleasures of old

age are few, but what one is more
worthy of cultivation than a pleas-
ure that the body, even in decay, is
still able to enjoy without enfeeble-
ment, and which the judgment and
the memory can still lift to the plane
of the non-material?

I turn the pages of my Cellar
Book. Two lines, appearing toward
the end of The Waste Land, slip un-
bidden into my mind:

London Bridge is falling down falling
down falling down... .

These fragments I have shored
against my ruins,

HIS delightful discussion on

wine forms part of the newly
published book “Any Number Can
Play” by Clifton Fadiman. Long
beloved as a favorite radio and tele-
vision master of ceremonies, he
won much acclaim two years ago
with his first book “Party of One.”
As for the mind of Fadiman, it is
one of the most diverting as well as
the most penetrating now at large
in the area of comment on our life
and letters. There is not a page that
is not lit with a phrase, or an epi-
gram that will be joyfully quoted
wherever people value good com-
pany. His penetrating comments
cover a seemingly endless range of
subjects—from Alger to Wine with
way-stops at Cheese, Conversation,
Eggheads, Exurbia, Puns, and Tol-
stoy. We strongly advise getting
hold of a copy of “Any Number
Can Play,” as soon as you can, and
enjoy some pleasant hours in highly
civilized company.
