COTES-DU-RHONE

The Cotes-du-Rhone, although it is
not too many miles south of Bur
gundy, because of different weather
and sun conditions, does not neces
sarily follow the same vintage graph
that prevails along the Cote d’Or.
However, it did prove similar in the
fact that not much more than half
a crop was gathered and that prices
did open about 40% higher than
1967. Nevertheless, the quality
heights achieved in Burgundy sim-
ply did not prevail here. There is no
question but that the wines are good,
entirely acceptable and destined to
be appreciated, but they simply lack
the concentration and guts that
make great years in this area—such
years as 1961 and 1966. With Bur-
gundy prices:at new high levels, it
appears surprising to us that fine
wine such as Chateauneuf-du-Pape
have not found an increasing de-
mand and have not gone up even
further in price. They still remain
within the economic reach of a wine
drinker of modest means.

THE WINES OF
THE RHINE & MOSELLE

The weather conditions that prevail
in France are not necessarily appli-
cable in Germany, because we must
remember that the wines of the
Rhine and Moselle are grown in a
more northerly altitude than that of
Labrador and spend much of their
existence reaching out for the sun’s
warmth to survive. And as in the in-
stance of human beings, the vine’s
‘struggle to survive’ is what gives
German wines their character, com-
plexity and finesse.

In the Rheingau, the three weeks of
foggy weather, just before the har-
vest, proved detrimental to the
ripening of the grapes in the lower
sites, near the Rhine River itself.
However, the higher hill sites were
less affected by the fog—obtained
more sun and produced some truly
extraordinary wines—particularly
at Schloss Vollrads, Schloss Johan-
nisberg and Steinberg. Since the re-
sults are rather mixed here, ranging
from high average to excellent, both
the wine merchant and the wine con-
sumer must make a selection based
on the location of the vineyard,
and the wine merchants tasting
judgment.

During the period that fog prevailed
over the Rhine, the Moselle Valley
was bathed in sunshine. As a result,
the Moselles typify the fine vintages
of the ’60s. They are exceptionally
fine, fruity and elegant. They are
destined to please and bring much
tasting reward to German wire
connoisseurs, who have enjoyed fine
previous vintages. The ‘Berncasteler
Doctor’ vineyard has maintained its
dramatic and superior finesse, is be-
ing rationed because of low produc-
tion and has hit a-new high in cost.
The ‘Scharzhofberger’ vineyard, the

 

  

one we personally consider the best
in Germany, reflects in its quality,
the full quota of sunshine it has re
ceived, and can be considered one of
the best examples of Moselle pro
duced during the decade.

“HOW TO HAT BETTER FOR
LESS MONEY” is a most timely
title for the book that has been writ-
ten by two of our associates, James
Beard and Sam Aaron. Simon &
Schuster announces the publication
date of July 28th. Despite the mod
esty of these two gentlemen, this
volume will not enter the ‘world of
books’ without its share of fanfare
and advance drum-beating. ‘Ladies
Home Journal’ will feature a rather
detailed summary of the tome in
their forthcoming September issue.
The ‘Cookbook Guild’ have selected
‘How To Eat Better For Less
Money” to send their subscribers in
the near future. And the national
publication ‘Better Homes & Gar-
dens’ have chosen it for their book
club. On top of all this recognition,
those of you who subscribe to the
‘Book-of-the-Month’ Club, will be

able to make it your pick for the
month, since it has been chosen as
an ‘alternate selection.’

3eing curious by nature, we decided
to find out why this particular book
has achieved so much attention in
advance of publication from leading
magazines and book-clubs of
America. In interviewing wine and
food editors who have seen the gal-
ley proofs, we discovered that this
work genuinely has something new
and important to say —particularly
at a time when people have learned
to be sophisticated about food, be-
coming more involved in creative
cooking, wine drinking and would
like to do this without making too
serious a dent in the family budget.
