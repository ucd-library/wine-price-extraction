PARIS, THURSDAY, APRIL 17, 1969

gene eae sour came by jet and well-oiled by Moet &
Chandon, the Wine and Spirits Guild of America
rrived this week for its first Paris convention. The Guild
consists of 44 members who, despite the occasional whim-
sicality of their store names (Hocus-Pocus Liquors, Home
Liquors, Horseneck Liquors), have a dead-serious total

volume of $400 million a year.

Their convention, accord-

ing to Guild president Sam Aaron, is very significant.

“Wines and spirits have now become of age,’ Mr.
Aaron wrote in an excited letter heralding the group’s

arrival.

“Oniy a uecade ago,” the letter continued, “the pos-
sibility of a convention of American wine merchants

taking place in France would
have been a phantasy.”

What accounts for the phan-
tastic change? An enormous in-
crease in wine consumption,
says Mr. Aaron, president of
Sherry-Lehmann’s in New York,
co-author of Time-Life’s ‘“Wines
and Spirits,” lecturer at US.
universities, and non-stop enthu-
siast.

“The consumption of Eu-
ropean wines in America is
going up by 15 percent per an-
num—which means about three
times as much is being drunk
now as ten years ago—and the
quality has gone up by six
times,” said Mr. Aaron. He had
had Corton Charlemagne for
lunch, had bought a paperback
called..“Brandy on the Rocks”
after lunch, and was now pour-
ing Heidsieck Monopole Diamant
Bleu.

“The best wine cellars are in
the hands of individuals in the
United States,’ Mr. Aaron said.
“The most sophisticated wine
drinkers are in America. The
best wine literature is by Amer-
icans Schoonmaker Lichine,
me. The future of French wines
lies in America!”

What, in that case, about the
future of the American liver?

Aaron said soberly. ‘The lon-
gevity rate will increase as we
go from cheap spirits to wine.
The medical profession has
established that the greatest
tranguilizer is wine. Hippo-
crategy used it to treat psychi-
atric problems and to heal cuts.

‘Wine is also the best invest-
ment you can make. ‘Adam
Smith’ wrote an article about
it. He said you can’t go wrong

Mr. Aaron was pouring prior
to a reception given by Mr.
Charles Heidsieck (ALL male
members of the the Charles
Heidsieck branch, even brothers,
are christened Charles). Here

Marquis de Roussy de Sales—
a leading Beaujolais grower, and
Allan Meltzer, a happy business-
man with a Florida suntan who,
with five other happy business-
men, had just bought the Cha-
teau Bouscaut vineyard in Bor-
deaux for $2 million.

The marquis and Mr. Meltzer,
who had not heard Mr. Aaron's
pep talk about American wine-
bibbing, were exchanging horro
stories about being served

an ice “Cube In  o& Slass. oF

asked if he agreed about the

high level of American con-
noisseurship.

“T think non-French people
who know about wine are more
enthusiastic. he sald. | they
have to import it, which makes
it more precious.”

“Familiarity breeds contempt.
That’s the basic psychological
basis of it all,” said Mr. Aaron.

‘Tt seems an awful fuss to
make when you consider that
the average American only con-
sumes 1.2 gallons of wine per
vear compared with the French-
man's 30 gallons,” said Mr.
Meltzer.

“You can look at it negative-
ly if you like,” said Mr. Aaron,
hurt. “But remember Ameri-
cans only averaged half a gallon
of wine ten years ago, and the
French use wine for iIntoxica-
tion. We have other means
scotch, bourbon.

“Psychologically speaking, wine
is the thing of the moment in
America,” said My. Aaron. “Af

lecting. Now it’s the collecting
of wine cellars.”

table, says Mr. Aaron, they are
already apparent: “An Ameri-
can millionaire could get a $60,-
000 Picasso more easily than a
case of Romanée-Conti which
would cost about $300. In fact
T’ll bet $500 that no one can
get a case of Romanée-Conti.”

(With production of Ro-
manée-Conti at about 500 cases
a year, Mr. Aaron might win
his bet.)

One reason why Mr. Aaron
feels he can claim superiority
for American winemanship is
that Americans put a lot of
elbow grease into their elbow-
bending.

“They come to my store like
it’s the Museum of Modern Art.
They study, they work at it.
Frenchmen think they’re born
with an innate wine knowledge
on their birth certificate. It’s
not true.”

Mr. Aaron took up the stu-
dy of wine in 1934. “I went to
a department store, the Galeries
Lafayette I think it was, and
had a Graves—a cheap, lowest
common denominator Graves
that I would disdain now, but
then I paused and thought it
was the greatest experience in
life outside of sex.”
