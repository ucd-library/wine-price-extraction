Most of you are familiar with
James Beard’s food and wine ac-
tivities, particularly his classic
books on cooking, his monthly
column in GOURMET MAGAZINE,
his internationally famous cooking
school. and the consistent regard
and respect he has obtained
through the years from the food
editors of America.

Aware of Mr. Beard’s creative
imagination, and the sense of joy
with which he approaches the
Christmas dinner, we asked him
what he would like to serve at
Christmas IF PRICE WERE NOT
A FACTOR. The menu appears on
the front page of this brochure—
the step-by-step details of how to
proceed follow below.

‘And what goes with the best caviar ¢
My opinion is simply good toast, butter
‘f vou wish. and a touch of lemon—as
vou can see, I am a purist. For those
who are willing to dilute and make the
caviar go further, of course the tradi-
tional thing to do is to add chopped
eoo and onion. Many like to have Cham-
nagcne with their caviar but not me. |

Stolichnavs or Russkaya—or a superb

accompanied by the superb Corton

Charlemagne 1966 of Laléur-Piot—the

Malpaque of Canada are now out of sea-

son and the Belon of France are much

too hazardous to bring in by air. In my

opinion, the Chincoteagues are the best

available at this time of year. The Chin-
coteagues can be obtained at any good
fish dealer on the East Side. | suggest
vou order them in advance before your
dealer runs out. Plan on 6 to 12 oysters
per person, dependent on the appetites
of your guests, the size of your serving
plates and the generosity of your purse.
Simply serve lemon wedges and the
thinnest of rye bread, with good sweet
butter, as the oyster accompaniment.
This simple approach, rather than dous-
ing the oysters in sauce, will bring out,
‘n most dramatic fashion, the great
white wine—Corton Charlemagne 19066.

Corton Charlemagne is one of the
creat white Burgundies — when at its
hest. as in this case, it is in a class of the
‘llustrious Montrachet. It is a dramati-
cally fine accompaniment to oysters.

Fditor’s Note: Sherry’s share of this
Corton Charlemagne 1966 is not many
cases. We urge ordering it early. It costs
$6.99 the bottle ($75.50 the case) and
our comparative shoppers indicate that
this wine generally commands almost
$10.00. If you want an outstanding wine
that is not quite as costly, we strongly
endorse the Puligny M ontrachet Referts
1964 of Sauzet at $4.79 the bottle,

$51.75 the case.
