port, on the dry side, particularly popular as an aperitif in France.

BLANDY’S SERCIAL (Very dry) .............

Dry, austere and distinctive, this remarkable Madeira, made by Blandy

POSITANO

APERITIF WINE

  
   
 

     
  
 

Here is an entirely new French
aperitif specially created to sat-
isfy demands for a light, refresh-
ing, delicate, “bitter-sweet”
drink. It contains less than one-
third the sugar content of any
other aperitif. Positano is delight-
ful served straight or on-the-
rocks—equally exciting when
mixed half and half with gin or
vodka.
