462 NEUCHATEL, grown by the town of Neuchatel 20 1.89 20.40

We have represented this vineyard for two decades. It is the proud property of the charming, civilized town of
Neuchatel. The Mayor shows the vineyard with the same sense of pride that the Mayor of New York points out the
Metropolitan Museum of Art. This wine can contribute a lot to your summer pleasure. It is bone dry, thirst-
quenching, refreshing and with a subtle, haunting bouquet. Available in half bottles at $1.09 each, $23.40 the case.

541 FENDANT SPATLESE, Estate Bottled, Bishops of Sion 2.25 1.89 20.40

A DISCOVERY! — one of the most highly regarded dry white wines of Switzerland. From a vineyard owned for
centuries by the Bishops of Sion. Time stripped the Bishops of their temporal power, but their vineyard properties
were respected. A bone dry white wine of unusual breed and charm — quantity limited — and a superb 1964! Don't
overlook this one. Available in half bottles at $1.09 each, $23.40 the case.

830 ST. SAPHORIN, ROCHES BRULLES, Cave Pinget 2.49 1.99 21.50

There is a 10 mile stretch of a mountainous semi-circle from Lausanne to Montreux. Its steep slopes, which
include the jewel-like town of St. Saphorin, produce some of the finest white wines of Switzerland. This one is
extraordinary.

892 CORTAILLOD, PREMIER CHOIX, Caves des Coteaux 2.49 1.99 21.50

Agreeable, crisp, light white wine produced around the village of Cortaillod, a charming town on the shores of
Lake Neuchatel. The equally distinguished sibling of Neuchatel.

895 TWANNER ENGELWEIN, Bielerseewein 2.49 1.99 21.50
In the Canton of Bern, (not far from the Swiss capital, Berne). This delightful dry white angel wine is grown
on the hillsides that surround the town of Twanner.

889 JOHANNISBERG DE VALAIS, Martel 2.49 1.99 21.50

The Swiss respected the Riesling grape of the Rheingau and brought it to the suburbs of Lausanne, from where
this wine comes. Some consider this the best wine of Switzerland.

886 AIGLE GRAND VIN, Cave d’Aigle 2.75 2.19 23.65

At the eastern end of Lake Geneva, in the Canton of Vaud, there are the wonderful vineyards of Aigle. Has all
the crisp freshness of a mountain wine. Available in half bottles at $1.24 each, $26.65 the case.

893 YVORNE, GRAND VIN, Cave d’Aigle 2.75 2.19 23.65

A wine that the Swiss like so much that it rarely leaves their country. Made from the Fendant grape in the district
that bears the somewhat confusing name of Chablais, southeast of Lake Geneva.

885 DEZALEY RENARD, Cave Pinget 2.75 2.19 23.65

The two great aristocrats of the Lavaux area are Johannisberg, made from the Riesling grape, and Dezaley, made
from the Fendant grape. Here is a clean, refreshing, bone dry white wine of exceptional character.

SWISS VIN ROSE...
757 ROSE DU VALAIS SEG 2.49 1.79 19.35

The vineyards of Valais stretch from the foothills of Mont Blanc and extend to the northern side of the Simplon
Tunnel. The mountain altitude is ideal for the production of a pink wine, giving it the crisp freshness, clean
dryness and austere taste born out of the adversity ‘of high altitude survival.
