Here is one of the best non-vintage Champagnes we have ever tasted. It is a remarkable blend of the light and ele-
gant 1960’s, combined with the wonderful, fruity Cuvee of the 1959. Though there is no vintage date on the label,
here is a wine that will rival and equal even the better of the vintage Champagnes. Specially priced at $6.98. Also
available in half bottles at $3.75 each, and in Splits at $1.97.

available in half-bottles at $1.99 each, $42.95 case of 24.
