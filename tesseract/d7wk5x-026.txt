RED WINES

POMMARD EPENOTS 1953
Estate Bottled, L. Poirier

One of the best examples of Pommard produced during
this decade.

CLOS DE LA ROCHE 1952
Estate Bottled, Jacques

Some of the greatest wines of Burgundy are produced in
the township of Morey from whence comes this remark-
able Clos de la Roche. Sturdy, full — a big wine.

BEAUNE GREVES 1949
Estate Bottled, Duvault-Blochet

Authentic 1949s have almost disappeared completely.
Here is an extraordinarily fine survivor.

WHITE WINES

CORTON CHARLEMAGNE 1955
Estate Bottled, Chapuis

The white wines from the Corton Charlemagne vineyard
are among the noblest of France, hard to come by, and
can be classed with the great Montrachets.

MEURSAULT, CLOS DES PERRIERES
1955, Estate Bottled, Grivault

Many authorities consider Clos des Perrieres (43 acres )
the best single vineyard of Meursault. A consistent favorite
among fanciers of white Burgundies.

RHINE & MOSELLE WINES

GRAACHER HIMMELREICH SPAT-
LESE 1955, Estate Bottled, Pfarrkirche

The vineyard is owned by the Church of St. Michael on
the Moselle and the proceeds thereof go towards support-
ing the Church. The devotion to the care of the vine and
the celler is reflected in the outstanding quality shown
by this truly magnificent Moselle.

SCHLOSS VOLLRADS CABINET 1953
Estate Bottled, Graf Matuschka-Greiffenclau

In great years, the wines of Schloss Vollrads are among
the greatest of Germany. The title “‘Cabinet”’ is not given
lightly here — it means the best of class and extraordinary
wine of great distinction.

Your choice of

Estate Bottled, Du Clos Maire

A distinguished example of Estate bottled Cote de Beaune.

BEAUNE, CLOS DES MOUCHES 1953
Estate Bottled, Duvault-Blochet

The Clos des Mouches vineyard is directly adjacent to the
boundary of Pommard and produces a distinguished red

Burgundy — ‘‘tres elegant’’ says the local growers.

WHITE WINES

MEURSAULT CHARMES 1953
Estate Bottled, Joseph Matrot

One of the pleasantest Meursaults we have run across.

CHABLIS VAUDESIR 1955
Estate Bottled, Louis Begue

Perhaps the most famous of the 8 Grand Cru vineyards of
Chablis is that of Vaudesir. Here is a perfect expression
produced during an outstanding year. Unfortunately, all
we could acquire were 30 cases.

RHINE & PFALZ WINES

RUDESHEIMER ROTTLAND
SPATLESE 1953, Estate Bottled, Staatsweingut

A glorious 1953. Only 20 irreplaceable cases remain.

FORSTER JESUITENGARTEN
1955, Estate Bottled, Bassermann-Jordan

The Jesuitengarten vineyard of the Pfalz is rated as the
most valuable agricultural land in Germany. A rare wine
with great elegance.

A few of the wines of the Rhone Valley, such as Chateauneuf-du-
Pape and Tavel, need no introduction. But there are many others,
red, rosé and white, which are less celebrated, but nevertheless won-
derful for everyday drinking.
After tasting over a hundred such wines, we have selected three, bottled

in Avignon, and we are calling them PONT D’AVIGNON, in honor of the
old broken bridge and the old roundelay. They are just glorified ‘vins du
pays, but delightful ones; a dry white wine, pale and clean: a soft, full-
bodied, well-balanced red; a fragrant little rosé, fresh and gay and charming.
