“DISCOVERED IN THE SANTA CRUZ MOUNTAINS”

ST. MICHEL WINES
From a vineyard in the Santa Cruz
mountains of California comes our
St. Michel wines.—both red and
white. Like the cheerful ‘vins du
pays’ of the French countryside,
these two delightful wines have
won an ever increasing number
of devotees. The red is delicate

and flavorsome — the white is

‘light-as-air’ and completely dry. And ifit is small bottles that you prefer,
we have them at 49c each—$11.50 the case of 24 halves.

Editor's Note:—James Beard, one of our associates at Sherry Wine & Spirits Co.,
Inc., has written several leading books and articles on the subject of food and
wine. The enthusiastic acclaim with which his articles in our recent catalogs
were received made it a ‘must’ that it appear in this issue.

We can now doff our extra heavy coat and once again put
the rubbers into the rear of the shoe closet as gentle
Spring joyfully emerges from the winter cocoon. Even
your palate reacts to the new-found freedom of Spring -
you rush madly to buy the first asparagus in the market
and revel in the fresh rhubarb and strawberries and all
the crisp, delicious greens. And drinking habits, too,
change with the calendar - as for me, I know Spring has
officially arrived when a great yearning develops within
me for that fragrant liqueur of Alsace, the clear white
and delightful Eau-de-vie de Framboise. After an
absence of several years, I can now happily bring the
news that the first shipment is about to arrive in time
to add its delightful touch of pleasure to your Spring
entertaining. It is our advice that you reserve your
bottle soon, for the supply (both in France and here) is
quite limited. It will be fairly expensive (12.42), yes
indeed, but well worth the investment. Its delicious
companion, the Mirabelle de Lorraine, will also be
available, but at lesser cost.

Succulent ham is a dish that flourishes at this time of

the year and it seems to be an unwritten tradition in this
country to celebrate the pascal season with the smoked

hip of the pig. Each of us has his favorite method of
preparing this popular dish - however, I shall be courageous
and offer a variation that I think you might like. Buy a
tenderized - ready to eat - ham of good mark. Remove
