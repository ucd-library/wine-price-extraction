Our associate, Sam Aaron, has just returned from his
January vineyard tour of Burgundy. He reports the follow-
ing, “Armed with a fist full of money, and even if the wine
buyer ignored price as a factor, it is questionable whether
he could find, visitng grower after grower, 200 cases of
genuine, truly fine, estate bottled red 1959 Burgundy among
all of the reputable growers of the Cote d’Or.

The effect of the title “Vintage of the Century” which has
been bestowed on the 59s, has created enough buying pres-
sure to denude the cellars, despite the large crop. Most were
soundly made, are perfect today and display great charm
and delicacy. If you want te drink great red Burgundy,
vibrantly alive with fruit and charm, drink these for the
next few years—and you will match wine pleasure of a pre-
vious generation, who were equally lucky with the 1934s—
a vintage similar in its character.

217 BEAUNE GREVES . 3... . mee 43.95
Estate bottled, Roger Duchet

The better vineyards of Beaune are characterized by softness and lightness,
noted for finesse and aroma, and are relatively quick to mature, Here is per-
haps the best single vineyard of this famed wine producing town and is a true
glory in 1959.

816 NUITS ST. GEORGES,
VAUCRAINGS. 2 2s 3 eee 43.95
Estate bottled, H. Gouges

We saw Mr. Gouges last month, just before this venerable gentleman reached
his 74th birthday. We tasted through ten vintages from this vineyard and none
were more remarkable than this 1959. Destined to be very long-lived. Worth
at least 50% more.

263 VOSNE ROMANEE,
MALCONSORTS ..-« «+s » 4.99 54.95
Estate bottled, Olivier

We went through the cellars of five leading growers in the town of Vosne
Romanee last month. Believe it or not, there weren’t 25 cases of an authentic
1959 to be had anywhere. From 15 blessed acres and a gem.

684 BONNES MARES. ... . . 499 54.95
Estate bottled, A. Lichine

Soft, ready for drinking and exhibiting wonderful delicacy despite deep texture.
A thoroughbred.

225 POMMARD, RUGIENS. .. . 4.29 47.25
Estate bottled, B. Courcel

There are thousands of cases of Pommard shipped throughout the world but
only 1500 cases of authentic Rugiens are produced a year. The wine is firm,
ready, with wonderful bouquet and breed.

"710 CORTON © Bok ee eee 53.50
Estate bottled, Prince de Merode

The good prince lives in a 15th Century chateau surrounded by a moat. His
prize wine is his Corton and he produces only six barrels or 150 cases in a
year. The heritage is undisputable and the wine shows it.

*206 VOLNAY SANTENOTS,
CUVEE GAUVAIN. ... . 5:39 59.50
Hospices de Beaune

Twelve barrels of 25 cases each were produced in 1959 and they went up on
auction. The price they commanded was record-breaking and some of this
wonderful wine found its way to our cellars. Cote de Beaune at its best.

685 VOSNE ROMANEE,
CLOS DES REAS. .. 3. « 4 Sere 63.75
Estate bottled, Louis Gros
The distinguishing characteristics of the great wines of Vosne are lingering
bouquet and rich, full character. In the masterful hands of Louis Gros, Mayor
of the town, the Clos des Reas vineyard has achieved the delicacy and balance
in this year that provides classic distinction.

786 CLOS VOUGEOT 1959... . 6.99 77.00
Estate bottled, Henri Lamarche

We first tasted this remarkable 1959 Clos Vougeot in London last month and
we immediately were aware that not only were we drinking the best Clos
Vougeot we have ever tasted but one of the most magnificent red Burgundies we
have experienced in a long time. We salute Mr. Lamarche for his perfect

vinification.

213 BONNES MARES. ... + > 7.95 $5.86
Estate bottled, Comte de Vogue

The most classic red Burgundies of all are those produced by the Domaine
de la Romanee Conti and by the Comte de Vogue. As far as we can judge the
last 12 cases of the 1959 that exist in commercial channels are available at our
shop. We suggest early acquisition before these treasures quickly disappear.

237 MUSIGNY, VIELLES VIGNES . 9.50 102.60
Estate bottled, Comte de Vogue

The price is high—the wine is truly great. Made from original vines that pre-
date the phylloxera. This year is fabulous. We are contending with one of the

greatest red Burgundies produced during our lifetime.

“Half bottles available at $3 extra the case.
