691 SCHARZHOFBERGER AUSLESE ........ 6.49 70.10
Estate Bottled, Egon Muller
Very rich, superb — a true “great.”

If you intend serving Rhine and Moselle this com-
ing summer, don’t overlook this list. It must be
remembered that the German mark has been re-
valued upwards by 8%; the better wines of 1966
and 1967 are becoming scarce, thus forcing the
prices upwards, and shipping costs have gone up.
All this will surely be reflected in higher prices
next summer. Obviously now is the time to acquire
these wines.
