Ne RED BURGUNDIES

911 BEAUJOLAIS MONTMELAS 1957... - - + + = :

The engaging and increasingly popular light red wines of Burgundy are at their best
when young and are excellent for summer dining. Here is a particularly pleasant
example at delightfully low sale cost.

Bea HRATIOLAIS, RINGUEL, 1955.
A distinguished Beaujolais that is everything that fine Beaujolais should be—purplish
red, with the fine aroma and taste of crushed grapes. A true discovery.

274 BEAUJOLAIS BROUILLY 1955, Domaine des Tours... x.
Beaujolais at its magnificent best; light, refreshing, from one of the best vineyards of
the district.

oo PL EURIE LES MOBILES 1957, Mioussett = =. we te ~
Estate bottled at a magnificent vineyard; particularly appreciated by the connoisseurs
of gastronomic Lyon. The perfect red wine in warm weather.

304 CHASSAGNE MONTRACHET ROUGE 1957... . . x.
Estate Bottled, C. Ramonet
This surprising wine comes from a top flight vineyard more famous for its whites
than its reds. Here is a red wine of astonishing class—big, sturdy, and full of what
Robert Louis Stevenson called “soft fire.”

oe ACN CUGVES (953 8 we ee ee.
Estate Bottled, Duvault-Blochet
Perhaps the finest red wine of the Cote de Beaune comes from the Greves vineyard
not far from Beaune, the wine capital. Here is a glorious 1953, round, well balanced.
of fine texture.

oo 2 RIN CCOR CHAPIPRE, 1955.
Estate Bottled, P. Gelin
A red wine of distinction and breed, and a flavor that recalls that of the famous
Chambertins which are produced a few hundred yards farther south on the same
slope.

3274 6NUIFES ST. GEORGES, LES VAUCRAINS, 1955... .. . x.

A beautiful example of deep, full bodied Nuits St. Georges, Estate bottled by Henri
Gouges, the master grower of Nuits.

351 POMMARD, LES EPENOTS, 1952
Estate bottled, L. Poirier

The best vineyard of Pommard—nurtured to perfect maturation by the great grower
Poirier. A beautiful harmony that will delight the lover of outstanding red Burgundy.

323 CLOS DES TART 1952
Estate bottled, Monmessin
Sturdy, slow maturing, one of the great red wine vineyards of Burgundy. Glorious
depth and balance—great, great wine.
232 VOLNAY, POUSSE D’OR, 1949
Estate bottled, Domaine Chavigne et de Lavorielle
This is truly a connoisseur’s reward in great Burgundy. Only 20 cases remained in the
proprietor’s cellar—it was not easy to persuade him to part with them. A perfect 1949.
204. LA ROMANEE 1953

This tiny two acre vineyard produces the ‘ne plus ultra’ of France’s red wine. An irre-
placeable treasure that merits present acquisition while still available.

171 POMMARD, DAMES DE LA CHARITE, 1934

Hospice des Beaune
A great 1934 acquired over 20 years ago at the annual Hospice de Beaune auction. It
had been resting, untouched, in one of the best private cellars in France until last Fall.
Sheer perfection.
