565 MUSIGNY, Thévenin Diet 249.50

Incomparable is the word for Musigny. Delicate
and feminine where its peers are dramatic and
powerful, Musigny is rightly renowned for its
complexity of flavor and bouquet. This eminent
example from the highly regarded Roland Thévenin
only now comes into its own.

Richebourg's renown need not be repeated here. Let
it suffice to say that Charles Vienot's Richebourg 1966
ranks as one of the giant Burgundies of our generation.
