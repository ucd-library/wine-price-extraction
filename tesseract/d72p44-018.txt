After carefully perusing this wine list, James Beard commented, “‘I have
spent almost a half-century travelling throughout the world and collect-
ing wine lists from everywhere. I know of no other list in existence that
matches this one if judged by width of range, discriminating selection,
and realistic prices. Whether the standard be day-in and day-out jug
wine, wines for laying down, rarities from previous decades, the choicest
examples from the leading wine-growing areas of the world—all are in-
cluded. The wisdom of over three decades of tasting, learning, compar-
ing, is reflected here. I extend my congratulations to Sam and Michael
Aaron and David Reilly for the creative joy that they have brought to
the wine lovers of America.”
