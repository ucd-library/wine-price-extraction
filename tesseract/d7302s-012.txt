QUAI DES ETATS-UNIS—NICE Riviera

1959 WHITE BURGUNDIES continued

620 MEURSAULT CHARMES 1959... 3.99 43.95

Estate bottled, J. Monnot

We feel sentimental about the 80 year old Mr. Monnot whom we recently
visited and his tiny wine cellar which perfectly houses the total production of
all his white Burgundies—never more than 250 cases a year! However, though
the quantity be small, the wine that he puts in the bottle is unsurpassed and
possibly unequalled among the white wines of France. Here is a treasure indeed,
a great 1959, with extraordinary depth of flavor and bouquet.

662 CHASSAGNE MONTRACHET,
CAWLTERETS, fa5° . 3.49 38.75

Estate bottled, Claude Ramonet

We recently visited M. Ramonet and tasted this wine in barrel. Like Archi-
medes. we shouted “Eureka” because here was one of the most flowery and
perfectly balanced white wines we have ever tasted. Like its predecessor, in
1947. we are dealing with a wine of great power and class that will bring its
rewards, not only for present drinking, but for several years to come.

*684 BATARD MONTRACHET 1959 ..........--. 4.39 48.50

Estate bottled, Ramonet-Prudhon ;
Like its next door neighbor “Le Montrachet”, Batard Montrachet 1s surely one

of the great white wines of the world. Only a small quantity 1s reaching us and
683. LE MONTRACHET 1959

we suggest early ordering to avoid disappointment.
7.10 78.00
Estate bottled, Baron Thenard

The tiny bit of soil called “Le Montrachet”, which has the look of a cemetery
because of its stone wall, produces what many believe to be the greatest dry
white wine on earth. Some of the choicest land is owned by Baron Thenard and
we are here dealing with the “ne plus ultra”. This 1959, estate bottled, 1s a
work of art among wines, 1s expensive, but well worth it to those seeking out

new heights in wine treasure. 13
