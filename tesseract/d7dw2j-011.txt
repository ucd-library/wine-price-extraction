 

BEAUJOLAIS

We quote Frank Prial from the New York
Times of April 13th, “Anything older than 1975
Beaujolais should be consumed .. . if you think
of laying in some Beaujolais, it might be wise
to forget 1975 and wait for the arrival of the
1976s.”

We happily report that thanks to the generous
cooperation of our Beaujolais growers, we can
offer you for practically immediate delivery
the superb ‘76 Beaujolais Villages and the
utterly astonishing and truly great Brouilly,
Chateau de La Chaize 1976. Perhaps the best
Beaujolais we have ever tasted in our lifetime
is the Tete de Cuvee, Chateau de La Chaize
1976 in Gold Magnums. (Only a token ship-
ment has been sent to the United States.)

you want them for future gift-giving, suggest
you buy your supply now while still available.
Last year’s Christmas stocks sold out in a

1975 BEAUJOLAIS
BEAUJOLAIS, Marquis de Sales 2.99 34.75
The proprietor of Chateau de La Chaize also
makes a small quantity of wine bearing only
the simple name ‘Beaujolais.’ This is the kind
of wine, served cool, that goes well with ham-
burgers and steaks as they come off the grill.
(#285)

BROUILLY, Chateau de

Ne ee 3.99 44.50
Beautifully balanced, much finesse. Not quite
as deep, fruity or mouth-filling as the ’76 La
Chaize above, but utterly delicious. (#299)

RED BURGUNDY

Again, we quote Frank Prial (N.Y. Times, April
13th)—‘The 1973s were excellent wines (the
biggest crop in modern times in Burgundy) ...
the 1972 vintage should peak in another three
years.”

We suggest that the ’73s, rich in charm and
exhilerating bouquet, should be consumed
within the next few years. The ’72s will reach
their best in about three years, remaining at a
plateau level of high excellence for another
five years before the fruit starts to weaken.
We list only one 1976 now-—the greatest we
have tasted. We could not resist offering it.

1976 RED BURGUNDY
CHAMBERTIN RUCHOTTES ..13.95 159.05
There are nine tiny vineyards that are classi-
fied Grand Cru Chambertin, and Chambertin
Ruchottes is among those regal nine. Even in
an average year, this wine is always astonish-
ingly deep, very expensive, and hard to come
by. In 1976, it hit a pinnacle of true greatness.
Order now—we will deliver in November—if
you wait none will remain. Th. Bassot. (#475)

1973 RED BURGUNDY

The charm, the fruitiness and the disarming
deliciousness will delight you. A year we can
all be grateful for.
