COLLECTOR’S ITEM — 16 YEARS OLD

The first annual Jeffersonian Dinner, spon-
sored by Institutional Investor, was held
recently at the Savoy Hotel in London. Dra-
matically, this very bourbon was served in
a brandy inhaler instead of Cognac to accom-
pany the coffee. This noble Kentucky spirit
won plaudits for excellence from the many
Europeans who attended. Quantity limited—
priced below $12.00.
