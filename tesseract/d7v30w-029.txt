ome minor economic miracles are taking place here.

The wondrous Muscadet “La Nobleraie” sold for $4.49

two years ago—and despite the weakness of the dollar

we are still able to offer it at only $4.49; Cler’ Blanc is
maintained at $3.59 and not priced at the $4.29 it should
currently demand; the Sauvignon Blanc de Touraine, a wine of
dryness and high’ quality, is only $4.99. These delightful fruity
wines from the “Garden of France,” the Loire Valley, are
among the best wine values on the globe. They are wines that
will stand you in good stead throughout the summer.
