While shopping for antiques in London last year, we chanced upon a beautifully
executed “FIRKIN”, embellished with brass hoops and it cost $30, which now occu-

will be forever grateful for the “FIRKIN” and its
manifold after uses—for fireplace logs, magazine or
umbrella holder, plant stand or just as a decorative

object in it’s own right.
