CARRUADES 1967 was the last vintage at Chateau Lafite

Rothschild that was bottled under the Carruades
label. This 1967 is therefore a collector's item,
available in limited quantity only, and will
never be replaced by any future vintages. The

196% complexity and distinction of a wine grown and

TA CHATEAU PETRUS 1972 975 119.40
(Pomerol)

We quote from Terry Robard's New
York Times Book of Wine, "The
unchallenged King of Pomerol is
Chateau Petrus; year atter year one
of the greatest red wines produced

in the world. It is big and rich,

but soft and elegant at the same
time, reaching extraordinary peaks."

 
   

POME ROL i

Here is the only red wine of Bordeaux
that frequently commands a higher
price than Lafite. This is particularly
true in a year such as 1972 when Petrus ——

outshines Lafite. It must be remembered that Petrus produces great wine
regardless of vintage. Petrus 1972 makes a bid to being one of the best
clarets you are likely to run across - rich, full, dramatic; with enough
tannin to assure longevity.

 

At $9.95 the bottle, it is undoubtedly the best value in great red Bordeaux
available anywhere in the United States. A word of caution - we doubt
whether 300 cases exist in the country - none remains at the vineyard — so
we suggest you order quickly before it is all gone.

Also available in half-bottles and magnums at $3 the case additional .

1001 CARRUADES DE CHATEAU LAFITE ROTHSCHILD 1966 (Pauillac) 2597 119.00
Here are the facts: 1) Chateau Lafite Rothschild 1966 now sells for
over $400 the case wholesale in Bordeaux and will probably approach
$1000 the case in a decade; 2) Carruades de Chateau Lafite Rothschild
1966 is the same wine but of younger vines. The difference between
them is subtle; 3) You can acquire a case of the Carruades 1966 now
for only $119, We predict it will triple in less than five years because

only a few hundred cases exist throughout the world.

315 CHATEAU LATOUR 1969 (Pauillac) 15 136.25
Not yet mature - will benefit from several more years in the cellar
- but acquire now at this low price.

We tell a story to gladden the heart of
the wine lover. It is the story of the best
red wine produced in Spain—the tale of

Henri Forner, an important Bordeaux
wine grower, Spanish by birth—and the
wine miracle he performed in Spain.

Because of his uncompromising dedi-
cation to excellence in wine-growing
Henri Forner is highly regarded in Bor-
deaux. He is the proud proprietor of two
of the noblest vineyards of the Haut
Médoc—Chateau de Camensac and
Chateau Larose Trintaudon. M. Forner
had long been aware that when Bor-
deaux was devastated in the 1880's by
Phylloxera, its more foresighted wine
growers crossed the Pyrenées to con
tinue their beloved craft in the favored
wine soil of the Rioja

vinced that if he applied the modern

complexity and finesse of those he pro-
duced in the Haut-Médoc. To fulfill his
dream, he decided to take no chances.
Firstly, he employed, as consultant, the
famed Emile Peynaud, the foremost
oenologist of the University of Bor-
deaux. He also obtained the best vine-
yard land in the Rioja Alta region and
built a new bodega, the equal of any
in Bordeaux. He brought in the finest
equipment for cool fermentation. To
assure proper aging, he imported thirty
million pesetas worth of small oak bar-
rels. The first harvest coincided with a
great vintage year—1970. Every drop is
of this vintage, and unlike most Spanish
wines, there is no blending among vin-
tages. We are dealing with a pure entity.
