English merchant ships. Charles II
in 1665 reaffirmed these laws but
added some exceptions, notably
the wines of Madeira.

American sailing vessels plying
from Boston, New York, Baltimore
and Savannah found the pleasant
island of Madeira a refreshing stop
on route to and from Europe and
Africa. On their return trips, they
brought goodly supplies of the
wines.

Records of colonial families
show that they regularly ordered
generous amounts of Madeira.
George Washington wrote in 1763
for a pipe (approximately 95 gal-
lons) of the best Madeira. In 1768
he ordered a butt of about 150 gal-
lons. Not long ago the Mount Ver-
non collection acquired a set of
six fine Madeira glasses that were
once the property of Washington.

Anyone who has had the plea-
sure of visiting Thomas Jefferson’s
hilltop home, Monticello, will re-
call his account books, which list
the purchase of large quantities of
Madeira.

The 1770 inventory of the
Governor’s Palace in Williams-
burg, Virginia included almost a
thousand gallons of Madeira. In
Boston the wealthy merchant,
John Hancock, of Revolutionary
fame, brought it in by the barrel-
ful in his sailing ships.

As Americans adopted the wine
they also left their impress on
its character, for it was because of
the rigors of the long voyages and
the demands of their customers
inthe New World that the shippers
in Madeira gradually altered the
wine-making process on the island.

Most likely the first Madeira
wines were simple red table wines,
with a small amount of the scarce
and rich Malmsey in addition. But
such wines did not travel well. By
the early 18th Century, some in-
genious shipper of Madeira hit
upon the idea of adding a good
jolt of brandy to each cask to give
the wine the strength to withstand
a long overseas trip.

Soon it became apparent that
Madeira wines turned out best
when they went on long voyages
into tropical regions. Shipments to
East India were the finest. The
brandy and wine

mixture of
shipped to India seemed to blend
together more smoothly and the
resulting drink had a mellow
quality most pleasing to the palate.

Some shippers believed this su-
perior quality could be attributed
to the rolling and pitching of
the ship; others surmised that
the slow heating in the hold of the
vessel fused and harmonized the
elements in the wine. For a time,
fine Madeiras were deliberately
shipped on ocean trips—to China,
to India, to the East Indies, and
back again—to mature the wines.
But a less costly and less precarious
method was needed.

In order to duplicate the effects
of a voyage in a hot climate, some
Madeira shippers took to exposing
casks of their wines to the sun,
letting them mellow for weeks or
even months. By 1800 many of the
leading wine merchants of Madeira
had built estufas—special rooms
in which the wines could be
brought to a high temperature
slowly and then slowly cooled.

At the same time Americans
were experimenting with their
favorite wine. At least one im-
porter, subscribing to the theory of
rolling and rocking, suspended his
casks of Madeira in the entry of his
offices. Each customer was expected
to give the cask a push as he en-
tered. Presumably the better the
business the more the Madeira
rocked and mellowed.

In Savannah, a wine merchant
and great connoisseur, Mr. William
Hebersham, became famous for
his Rainwater Madeira. It was
light and very dry—an elegant
apéritif. There has been much
argument about the origin of the
term ‘“ Rainwater.’’ It may have
come from the American practice
of storing casks in  housetop
cisterns.

At the peak of Madeira’s popu-
larity, the true Madeira fancier
had his own special shipper and
brand. Some of the wines were
named for the ships in which they
traveled, such as Hurricane and
Southern Cross; others carried the
names of the families who im-
ported them—Rutledge, Cadwala-
der, Gerry, Butler. The Butler 16
achieved some fame by capturing
the fancy of Daniel Webster.

When that well-known states-
man was invited to taste from a
friend’s stock of Butler 16, he
tasted and then stayed a fortnight
to consume the host’s entire sup-
ply—twelve bottles.

Historic Madeira

A wine that shines
from soup to nuts

By PAULA PECK and FLORENCE AARON

Americans once used Madeira extensively in the kitchen.
It was, and is still, the classic wine for cooking. The French
know this. Though they are not drinkers of Madeira (being
notorious nationalists when it comes to wines), the French
chefs have discovered its value. Sauce Madére is one of the
great French sauces. If you love fine foods as well as fine wines
you need Madeira in the kitchen.

There are wines that are so negative, or so delicate, that
their flavor disappears in cooking. There are others so aggres-
sive that they drown out all other flavors. Madeira has the
ability, more than any other wine, to blend, to add of its own
characteristic flavor without overpowering others. More than
this, it tends to fuse all other seasonings. Perhaps it is so at
home in the kitchen because it has already been through a
heating process of its own, so takes kindly to heat and can
act nobly as a catalyzing agent for other food flavors.

Rognons de Veau, Duc de Clarence
(Veal Kidneys in Madeira Sauce)

2 veal kidneys Salt and pepper

2 tablespoons butter + teaspoon thyme
1 carrot, diced 1 small bay leaf
8 small white onions 1 cup Rainwater Madeira
4 cup chopped parsley 4 cup brown meat gravy
2 cups sliced mushrooms (canned may be used)

Trim fat and core from kidneys. Slice $ inch thick. Cover
with cold water. Place over a medium flame and bring just to
a boil. Remove from heat and drain kidneys.

Melt butter in a heavy pot. Add carrots, onions and a little
parsley. Cook over low heat till vegetables are soft on the
outside. Stir in sliced kidneys and mushrooms. Season with
salt, pepper, thyme, and bay leaf. Add # cup Madeira. Cover
pot tightly and place in a 350°F. oven for an hour and a half,
or until kidneys are tender.

Remove lid from pot. Skim off fat, if any. Liquid in the pot
should barely cover kidneys. If there is too much, reduce it
over a high heat, after removing kidneys, till it has cooked
down. Stir in meat gravy. When mixture begins to bubble
again, add remaining Madeira. Arrange on serving plate,
sprinkle with chopped parsley and serve. Serves +4.
