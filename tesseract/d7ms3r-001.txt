The Artist and His Wife—a 15th Century engraving executed by

ISRAHEL VAN MECKENEM in c. 1490. As testimony to his

 

productivity, 624 of his plates are presently known. This work represents the first self-portrait of an early engraver. The lady to his

right is his wife, who in all likelihood, was his business partner.

Art, Wine and Wine Merchants ...a pleasing trinity united by
this sumptuous catalog. And quite properly so. For, without wine
merchants, wine, though still a thing of glory, would be bound
to its own narrow parish. Wine merchants transform a local
miracle into a universal blessing. As for great art, does it not
march well with the offerings of a great wine merchant? I think
your hosts at Sherry-Lehmann have done well to embellish their
catalog with these dazzling reproductions from the magnificently
mounted edition of Great Prints and Print Makers, written by
Herman J. Wechsler, and bearing the imprint of the famous art-

book publisher, Harry N. Abrams.

Rhine, framed in Baccarat glass against a background of gleam-

incomparable as Daumier, Picasso, Chagall, Toulouse-Lautrec,
Renoir, and other graphic masters, is not only a pleasant thought
on the part of Sherry-Lehmann—it is a most appropriate one.
These superb pictures and these excellent wines and spirits move

in harmonious tandem.

Some strange, inexplicable pattern that once flashed through
