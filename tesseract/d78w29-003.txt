among discriminating wine
drinkers for good, everyday
red wine at modest cost. Here
is an excellent collection. Each
will pass the test when the
cork is drawn.

174 CHATEAU LESTAGES 1949
(Haut Medoc)

One of the most extraordinary Claret opportunities
ever offered during the last decade. Here is a 1949
Claret of distinction and breed at a price consider-
ably below the usual cost of the average regional
wine.

381 COTES DU RHONE ROUGE 1953,
Pont d’Avignon

A fully, well-balanced red wine from vineyards not far from
Avignon. “Best red wine value in N. Y.” says James Beard.

110 MEDOC 1953, Albert Freres

An ideal selection for an everyday red wine.

228 GRAVES 1953, Albert Freres

A pleasing, relatively dry example of fine white Bordeaux.

The wines of the “Domaine de la Romanée-Conti”, be-
cause of their scarcity and magnificence, have always been
collector’s items among serious wine drinkers. It is there-
fore no ordinary event that twelve of its wines of excellent
vintage years are offered by a single wine merchant at
such relatively modest prices.

The Domaine de la Romanee Conti, which estate-bottles
everything it produces, consists of five vineyards; all of
La Tache, all of Romanée-Conti, goodly portions of Riche-
bourg, Grands Echezeaux and Echezeaux. These are the
most long-lived and the most sought after of all red
Burgundies.
