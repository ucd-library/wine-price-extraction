WHEN YOU SELECT

LEHMANN Private Brands . . .
Why?

@ At the time of the formation of the Scottish Trust
controlling distilleries identified with most of the
highly advertised brands, several other distillers,
equally reputable and some of longer existence, re-
fused to join and thereby lose an identity painstakingly
earned over a very long period.

Many of the best American distillers of Bourbons
and Ryes are independent.

Most of the reputable wine growers of Europe have
refused to join selling cartels.

It is with these independent distillers and wine
growers that our increasingly popular private brand
business is being developed. The reasons for this must
appeal to you.

1. Direct dealing between independents and
Lehmann, eliminating two intervening pro-
fits of agent and wholesaler.

. Saving of heavy magazine, newspaper and
display advertising charges assumed by agent
and paid by consumer.

. Freedom to capitalize on our judgment, in

your behalf, by selecting quality at sub-
stantial savings.

. Assurance of continuity of product without
deviation.

~

>. Our money back guarantee at all times.

For all of the reasons outlined above we unqualifiedly
recommend to the thrifty the carefully selected and
analyzed wines and spirits herein described, mindful

at all times of the enduring value of our reputation
earned since 1893.
