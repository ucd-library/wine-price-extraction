Discovered in Paris—
the rarest, finest, and most remark-
able Brandies of France.

In a recent issue of HOLIDAY Magazine, art lovers
were advised, when in Paris, to go to the Louvre—
and Brandy lovers to visit Jean Danflou, one flight
up on Rue Thabor. We heeded their advice and
found the most remarkable treasure-trove of Eaux-
de-Vie, Armagnacs and Cognacs we have ever ex-
perienced. It was a delightful afternoon we spent
with Mr. Danflou—not only an extraordinary taster
and authority on spirits, but one of the most civilized
of men. There are few outstanding gourmets in Paris
that have not frequented the ‘brandy boutique’ of
Mr. Danflou.

We happily report that we have brought the best
examples of his treasury to you—some of them over
a half-century old.
