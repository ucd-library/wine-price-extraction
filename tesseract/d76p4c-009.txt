Cognac fanciers, particularly the discrim-
inating brandy-drinkers of England, speak
glowingly of the brandies produced by the
century-old firm of Bisquit. The distin-
guishing characteristics are unusual
paleness and dryness, coupled with
delicacy and superb bouquet.

It is no ordinary event to be able to obtain
Cognac of such excellence—a brandy
that can pass the ‘balloon-glass test’ with
flying colors—at only $9.98 the bottle.
