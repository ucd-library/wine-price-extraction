RHONE VALLEY

Price-conscious wine lovers searching for excellent French wines at modest cost are
moving away from Bordeaux and Burgundy, and are turning their gaze toward the

Rhone Valley. Why? Because it is still possible to get some superb wines below
$5.00 the bottle - in some instances as low as $2.99!

LA VIEILLE FERME ROUGE eet?
1976, Cotes de Ventoux
Dry, fruity, splendidly-made
red from the slopes of Mt. Ventoux
in the Southern Rhone. The heritage of
this wine is simple and honest. Don't let
the low price dissuade you.

COTES DU RHONE 1976, La Vieille Ferre 3.79
From sore of the choicest vineyard land in the Rhone

Valley. A bit more complex and longer-lived than the

La Vieille Ferme listed above.

CROZES HERMITAGE ROUGE 1973, Caves Cooperative ou 77
Not quite as exalted as Hermitage itself, but similar in
style - and much less costly.

LIRAC ROUGE 1974, Domaine des Causses
Won Gold Award as best red produced at Lirac.

CHATEAU LA SERRE 1976, 4.49 5495
Cotes du Rhone

Burgundy has its Romanee Conti,

Bordeaux its Lafite Rothschild - and

the Cotes du Rhone its Chateau La Serre.
Considered the best single vineyard of its area.

HERMITAGE ROUGE 1973, Tain I'Hermitage
George Saintsbury called it 'the manliest of wine, '
Deep, intense - a powerful, velvety red.

CHATEAUNEUF=-DU-PAPE 1972, Comtes de Lauzes
Superb wine - deep crimson in color, full-bodied.

CROZES HERMITAGE BLANC 1977, Tain I'Hermitage 3.99
Dry clean taste and full body - like a good white Burgundy.

HERMITAGE BLANC 1973, Tain I'Hermitage Vue

Sauvion et Fils l Vin de Ta

be so named as French law permits

In truth Muscadet - but cannot Chor’ Blanc

only so many liters per hectare to bear

the name 'Muscadet.' Any over-production,
such as we offer here ~ although identical -
is not so entitled. Fresh, pale, bone-dry.

 

GROS PLANT SUR LIE 1976, Sauvion et Fils
In Nantes, no one eats oysters without Gros Plant. Very
dry, very delicate. Cuvee de Seigneur.

MUSCADET SUR LIE 1976, 3.97
Sauvion et Fils

Other Muscadets in the same league

are now fetching up to $4.99 the bottle.
Only an early, foresighted acquisition
permits us to offer a Muscadet Sur Lie of

this caliber at only $3.99. An absolute delight.

MUSCADET SUR LIE 1976, Chateau du Cleray 4.39
'Musaadet' is the favorite carafe wine of Parisian restaurants.
‘Muscadet Sur Lie’, however, is a more serious wine which

gains body and intensity after being left on its lees during

winemaking. Here is an estate-bottled beauty - very dry and flavorful.

VOUVRAY 1977, Chateau de Montfort 4,69

Ouvrez le Vouvray" is the cry that resounds throughout
the Loire Valley - and here is the echo that reaches New York.

QUINCY 1976, Raymond Pipet 4,99
Adjacent - and almost identical - to Sancerre and Pouilly
Fume, but at dramatically less cost.

MUSCADET SUR LIE 1976, Marquis de Goulaine

A best-seller throughout the U.S. The importer advises

us that based on current replacement cost, this should be
selling for $5.99 the bottle. A true value at this low price.

POQUILLY FUME 1976, Sauvion et Fils 8.49

Frosts practically wiped out both the '77 and ' 78 harvests
in Pouilly Fume. Sad indeed because this is one of the most

popular dry white wines of the world.

POUILLY FUME, LA DOUCETTE 1976 13.92
Note the effect of scarcity caused by frost damage on the
price of Pouilly Fume. Here is the best of them all. Let's

hope for a plentiful harvest in 1979.
