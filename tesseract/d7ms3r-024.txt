All wine experts agree that the best German wines are superb, and
are possibly among the best white wines of the world. Even the less
expensive ones are charming and have finesse.

The latitude of the German vineyards extend as far north as Labra-
dor. Grapes struggle to survive, but when they do, they are superb.
The most important areas are the vineyards that overlook the Rhine
and Moselle Rivers. We take these wines sufficiently seriously to
offer you, after many visits and tasting, those that we consider the
best of Germany.

! 1969 RHINE WINES

Some extraordinary wines were produced during this ex-
cellent year on the higher hills that avoided the fog that
prevailed prior to the vintage lower down along the river.
We have made a selection below based on geographical
position of the vineyard and our tasting notes. These are
truly outstanding and many can be laid down for future

drinking. ALL ARE ESTATE WINES.

During the 1969 harvest period, although the lower Rhine
was somewhat disturbed by fog, the Moselle Valley was
bathed in sunshine. The vintage can be called great, pro-
ducing fine, fruity and elegant Moselles—destined to please

is the time to acquire these outstanding 1969 Moselles. ALL
