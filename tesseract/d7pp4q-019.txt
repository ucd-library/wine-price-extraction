MUSCADET-SUR-LIE 1976 Be ee ae 37.55
‘Cur-Lie’ means that the wine never left the original bar-
rel and the contents were taken out from above leaving
the lees behind. This is a more watts and wasteful proc-
ess. but the result is that you get Muscadet with more
intense flavor. This beauty is estate-bottled by Sauvion.

Classic, clean. A distinguished example of this popular
wine. The first 1976 to arrive. Michat.

POUILLY BLANC FUME 1975 ..........- 6.99 75.49
The wines from the charming town of Pouilly-sur-Loire
have won the hearts of wine drinkers ’round the world

is acknowledged as the very best.

WINES OF SPAIN

There is more vineyard land in Spain than in any other country
in the world—less than 3% is Sherry. The best table wines are
from Rioja and some good ones are produced in Valdepenas.
For those who want good everyday table wine of quality, don’t

overlook the Marqués de Caceras red and white vintage
offerings.
