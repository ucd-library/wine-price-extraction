One of France’s
Noblest Vineyards

CHATEAU HAUT BRION was con-
sidered Bordeaux’s greatest red wine
back in the Middle Ages; it was immor-
talized in Samuel Pepys diary; during
the early 19th Century, it was the proud
property of France’s greatest diplomat,
Talleyrand; and now it has achieved its
highest apex of excellence under the
uncompromising dedication of the
Clarence and Douglas Dillon families.

Here is the uncontested “King of Graves” which was ranked as a ‘First
Growth’ in the 1855 classification simultaneously with Lafite Rothschild,
Latour, and Chateau Margaux. It was the lifetime favorite of His Majesty,
King Edward VII. Now it is sought after by discriminating wine drinkers
throughout the world. Experts claim it is the gravelly soil of Chateau Haut
Brion that gives the wine its unique combination of great power, harmoni-
ously coupled with delicacy and finesse.

The production is inadequate to meet the vast world demand — less than
6,000 cases were produced during the great 1969 vintage. Now is the time
to acquire the more recent vintages, which are still economically accessible,
and enjoy watching them skyrocket in value as they gain bottle-age.

EPOCH-MAKING SALE OF CHATEAU HAUT BRION 1965

1965 makes no claim to being the ‘vintage of the century.’ It is not a 1961 or a 1966, but some
Superb wines were produced, particularly at Chateau Haut Brion where the nobility of the soil
is reflected in the elegance and balance of the wine. This astonishingly fine '65, relatively light,
is quite ready to drink even today. With many good years ahead of it, it is probably the best
value in superb Claret that has been offered to the American public in over a decade. It costs
hardly more than ¥% the price of its famed successor, the 1966 vintage — yet it tastes better
than the ’66 today, simply because it is developing faster and is readier to drink.

We do not exaggerate when we state that the wholesale Bordeaux market price for this wine
commands more than the price we are here quoting. There is no better value in great ‘First
Growth’ Claret today than Chateau Haut Brion 1965 at $3.99 the bottle, $46.75 the case.
Quantity limited, and irreplaceable. We suggest you anticipate not just your summer, but also

your winter requirements NOW.
