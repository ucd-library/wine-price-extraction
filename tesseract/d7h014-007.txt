BEAUJOLAIS

" .q great, great year like 1976 in Beaujolais closely
followed by an equally great 1978, Ow research reveals that no 1976 Beaujolais
remains in Beaujolais cellars, and all U.S. importers are equally devoid of such

treasures. However, we do have a small reserve of the precious '76s still remain-

ing, and they are offered below at modest prices.
