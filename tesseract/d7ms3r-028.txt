SANTA CLARA VALLEY

The better Santa Clara vineyards are located along the foothills of
the Santa Cruz Mountains which tower high above the valley floor.

Because of the need for further plantings, some of the vignerons

have

extended their land holdings further to the south.

RIDGE VINEYARDS

Dominating the Santa Clara Valley are the Santa Cruz Moun-
tains. On one of the peaks, 2,300 feet above sea level. can be
found the remarkable Ridge Vineyards. The high altitude
lends itself to making superb Sylvaner and Riesling, and an
excellent red wine—Zinfandel. David Bennion, the wine-
maker, is a purist, insists on small barrels, avoids stainless
steel and aspires towards traditional perfection.

ALMADEN VINEYARDS

Almaden was originally founded in 1852 by two Frenchmen,
and has since been acquired by National Distillers. Here we
are dealing with the largest producer of varietals in Cali-
fornia. The dedication to quality is symbolized by the fact
that Fank Schoonmaker supervises their standards of excel-
lence. In addition to the familiar Mountain Red and White,
some of the best vintage varietals are produced here and the
Almaden rare and older reserves are listed below.

LIVERMORE VALLEY

Because of its 30 mile width, Livermore looks rather like a wild, roll-
ing plain than valley country. Like Germany and Bordeaux, the soil
appears coarse and gravelly. These conditions are peculiarly adapted
to the cultivation of good white wines.

WENTE BROS.

The Wente family came to this country from Germany dur-
ing the early ’80s, studied viniculture and started this re-
markable vineyard. It is their Pinot Chardonnay that won
the enthusiastic endorsement of inspectors from Guide
Michelin, who compared it to the best Meursaults.

NEW YORK STATE

Although the wine acreage in New York State is but a fraction of the
vineyard land of California, you will find here the same sense of

challenge and dedication to excellence. The important wine-growing
areas are the Finger Lakes, the Chautauqua area along Lake Erie,
and the Hudson Valley. The most significant development, after
years of experimental work, has been the introduction of a new
family of European wine grapes known as the French hybrids. They
have exhibited the ruggedness and excellence needed to grow wines
of European character under the hardship conditions of the cool
New York State climate. The best of them are listed below.

BOORDY VINEYARD

While editor of the Baltimore Sun, Philip Wagner, and his
wife Jocelyn, started a vineyard at their home property in
Maryland, experimenting with European wine grapes. They
succeeded to such an extent, that, in their quest for good
vineyard land, they established a second vineyard on the
south shore of Lake Erie.

DR. KONSTANTIN FRANK

We have recently visited Dr. Frank at his vineyard near
Hammondsport and were most impressed by his knowledge,
his complete commitment, and the astonishing excellence of
his white wines. Dr. Frank brought many of his cuttings
with him from Europe where he headed a vinicultural
school.

The Walter S. Taylor family have pioneered wine making

Lakes Museum is adjacent to their large plantings of su-
perior French hybrid varieties. Both their red and their
white represents a new trend towards excellence in New
York State wines.

HIGH TOR VINEYARD

 

There is a vineyard only 28 miles from Columbus Circle, up
the Hudson near Haverstraw, on High Tor Mountain. The
proprietor is Everett Crosby, a man of taste, who enjoys
making the local ‘vin du pays’ of New York City.
