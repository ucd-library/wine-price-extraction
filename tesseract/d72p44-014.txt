THE FAMOUS GROUSE
90° SCOTCH WHISKY

Our associate, David Reilly,
who taught at the University of
Edinburgh, states ‘‘THE FA-
MOUS GROUSE was the favor-
Ite Scotch whisky of the
University’s faculty. No weak
praise, since we must presume
that the most intellectual seg-
ment of Scotland would know
what whisky would reflect in
best fashion the best efforts of
their distilling industry.

THE FAMOUS GROUSE now
comes to America—the first 90
proof Scotch to reach us. We
did a bit of research and we
discovered that it was known
and respected in the Scottish
Highlands for over 170 years.
At 90 proof, you can use less
Scotch and more water, and get
the same results, if you are
careful in your measurements.

A PRINCE OF

COGNAC

MARTELL CORDON
BLEU is often the stand-
ard by which all other
aged, fine Cognacs are
judged. Remarkable deli-
cacy, coupled with long,
lingering taste and bou-
quet. Rare, truly out-
standing.

THE DISTINGUISHED AMBASSADOR SCOTCHES
YOUR CHOICE OF 8 OR 12 YEAR OLD

Mellowness comes with maturity. Unlike most scotch whiskies,
AMBASSADOR uses no whisky younger than 8 year old in

their regular blen

d—and in their premium whisky, even the

youngest ingredient has rested at least a dozen years in barrel.
Add age and distinction to your Christmas gifts this year—send

AMBASSADOR.
