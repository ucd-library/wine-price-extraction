THE 1966 VINTAGE IN BURGUNDY

We must remember that the recent good years such as '61, '62, and '64 in red Burgundy no longer
exist in the cellars of the growers. Most of them have sold off their bad '65s and are now trying to
dispose of their pathetic '67s which, by and large, were ruined by the September rains. The only
great Burgundies that remain in their cellars are the glorious 1966s and because this is the only
excellent wine they have to offer. The price at the vineyard therefore must be obviously very
costly - the highest in history.

Frank Schoonmaker puts the 1966 Burgundies just below the great 1961 level in his forthcoming
vintage chart where he states, "a wholly remarkable year. From the very beginning, the wines
had a special character and charm, an early sprightliness and fragrance and fruit which set them
apart." Their development has surpassed our highest expectations and are definitely headed for
great things. They would all be bottled and shipped by September or October 1968, and the
lighter ones, ready to drink 6 months or a year later - even those should have a life expectancy
of 7 or 8 years. Perfect wines for the early 1970s.
