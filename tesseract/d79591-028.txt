MADEIRAS

“The very existence, let alone the sheer perfection of these Ma-
deiras, is an historic wine event—these 19th Century Madeiras
have provided one of the great wine tasting experiences of my
life,” states James Beard.

We launch the holiday season with a wine event of significance—
an epoch-making offering of the most remarkable collection of
authentic 19th Century vintage Madeiras ever seen either in con-
tinental Europe or the United States.

Some of these wines are made exclusively from wine grapes that
predate the Phylloxera scourge that devastated the island in 1873.
The front label, individually numbered, states the total number
of bottles in existence while the back label, which gives the per-
sonal history of the wine, is hand-signed by a director of the im-
peccable firm of Blandy certifying that the bottle contains a
genuine Madeira of the vintage stated.

We have searched through the archives and have discovered that the existence of such splendid
examples in Madeira is chiefly due to the foresight and courage of Charles Blandy who, unlike

most of his contemporaries, built up stocks of fine Madeira.

When these are gone, the opportunity to taste authentic 19th Century Vintage Madeira of this

calibre will be lost forever.
