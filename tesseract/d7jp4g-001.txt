book :—

HOW TO EAT BETTER FOR LESS MONEY

by James Beard and Sam Aaron, associates at Sherry-Lehmann

The philosophy of the book inspired much of the text contained in these pages and has influ-
enced the selection of wines and spirits.

We happily report that “How to Eat Better for Less Money”
is the current selection of the Cookbook Guild, Better
Homes and Gardens Book Club, and the dividend selection

of the Book-of-the-Month Club. Excerpts have appeared in
the Ladies’ Home Journal, Woman’s Day, and ‘House and
Garden.’

dation on Automation and Employment, has just awarded
the book a special ‘book citation’ with the comment: “The
quality of life need not be diminished by the onslaught of
technology. James Beard and Sam Aaron have proven in
their book that gourmet food and wine is possible without
Straining the budget and with enthusiastic dedication to
excellence can actually elevate our standards.”
