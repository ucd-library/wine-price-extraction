EPOCH-MAKING SALE OF
CHATEAU HAUT BRION 1965

In gratitude for their patronage, we offer a uuane
holiday gift to our clientele. We offer them with
# gratitude Chateau Haut Brion 1965 at a price sub- |
stantially below the current prevailing wholesale {
cost in Bordeaux. Why do we do this? Because we

“4 have decided to price this wine not at the very

high current replacement cost, but on our early
acquisition cost, which was dramatically lower.

1965 makes no claim to being the “Vintage of the
Century!” It is not a 1961, but superb wine was
made in 1965 by some vineyards, particularly at
Chateau Haut Brion. The nobility of the soil, the

& | care and selection, the dedication—all are reflected

in the elegance, balance, bouquet and satisfying
taste of the wine itself. 1965 is not a year to lay

i! down—it is relatively light, delicious for the next

two or three years, and the kind of wine you can
serve proudly at even the most distinguished of
dinner parties.

These two wines should not be overlooked. The Simplet
is beautifully balanced and a delight. The Chateau
Bahans Haut Brion was grown at the famed Chateau
Haut Brion vineyard and is a blend of the 1964 and 1965
vintages. Extraordinary opportunity for those who want
truly outstanding wine at relatively modest cost.
