Since the early 19th century it has been the custom
of the Hine Family to set aside the best Cognac of a
particularly outstanding year for their own future
use—ultimately this old precious reserve is served

Merrie et iu

to honored guests on special occasions. For the first
time, Francois Hine has consented to part with a
few of these treasured bottles—each is numbered
and bears a back label relating the unique history

of the contents, hand-signed by a Hine director—

Dep, Ni

The glories of Burgundy, the
Rhine and Bordeaux are well rep-
resented here. Each of these is
an Estate bottled jewel, hard to
come by, and represent top flight
vinicultural efforts.

NUITS ST. GEORGES ARGILLIERES
1953, Estate Bottled, General Gouachon

Monsieur Gouachon, a retired French Army General, is

292 BONNES MARES 1953
Estate Bottled, Claire-Dau
In Chambolle, there are two really great vineyards —
Musigny and Bonnes Mares. Like Musigny, this has a

667 CLOS DE LA ROCHE 1952

Some of the greatest wines of Burgundy are produced in
the township of Morey from whence comes this remark-

A tremendous wine of great depth, vigor and balance.

SCHLOSS VOLLRADS CABINET 1953
Estate Bottled, Graf Matuschka-Greiffenclau

In great years, the wines of Schloss Vollrads are among

lightly here — it means the best of class and extraordinary
wine of great distinction.

308 BATARD MONTRACHET 1955

Estate Bottled, J. Bavard
Though quite in a class with Montrachet itself, the Batard
is not quite as fabulously expensive. A beautiful 1955.
