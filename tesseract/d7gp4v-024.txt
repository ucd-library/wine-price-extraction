RED WINES

278 CHAMBERTIN 1955

Estate Bottled, Gen, Rebourseau

Here is “Le Grand Seigneur,” a title that Chambertin
carries gracefully. Amazing balance and fullness, classic
distinction—the proudest of the red Burgundies.

MUSIGNY 1955 Estate Bottled, Hudelot

The magnificent wines of the Musigny vineyard are much
sought-aftet throughout the world. In our opinion, this
classic, velvety rarity will stand up against the noblest.

Crowning jewels among the
great red burgundies can be
found here — any one of them
can provide an extraordinary ex-
perience in wine drinking. Quan-
tities Limited!

RED WINES

Two of the greatest white wine
vineyards of the world are Mont-
rachet and Berncasteler Doctor.
They are hard to come by re-
gardless of price. At $5.99, this
is a unique opportunity not to be
overlooked by those who want
white wine at its absolute best.

WHITE WINE

336 GRAND MONTRACHET 1955
Estate Bottled, J. Bavard
The ‘ne plus ultra® of all French white wines is Le Mont-
rachet itself—an absolute maximum of 2000 cases a
year is produced by this single 18 acre plot owned by a
dozen proprietors. A glorious, much sought-after 1955.

MOSELLE WINE

513 BERNCASTELER DOCTOR SPATLESE
1957, Estate Bottled, Dr. H. Thanisch

Perhaps not as rich or sweet as 1953, but surely the
equal in class and distinction.

204 LA ROMANEE 1953

This tiny two acre vineyard produces the ‘ne plus ultra’ of
France’s red wine. An irreplaceable treasure that merits
present acquisition while our small inventory still remains.

1934

Hospice de Beaune

A great 1934 acquired over 20 years ago at the annual
Hospice de Beaune auction. Sheer perfection.

288 LA ROMANEE 1952

The same great vineyard as above, but of the 1952
vintage.
