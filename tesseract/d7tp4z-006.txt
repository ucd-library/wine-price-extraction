greatness of 1959 on the Rhine and Moselle.
This is certainly my opinion, and I have tasted
these wines, in Germany, and we here at
Sherry’s have quite a few of them alre: ady in
our cellars. What is your feeling about the
German wines now that many of them have
started to be bottled?

SCHOONMAKER: We are dealing with an
exceedingly great year, certainly unsurpassed
since the last war and in many ways compar-
able to 1921. But wine making methods in
Germany, as in France, have i anged con-
siderably in the past two decades: the wines
are bottled much eatlier than they were before
in order to conserve their freshness and charm.
As a result, the 59s will probably prove shorter
lived, but most of them, on the other hand, are
now ready to drink and the others will be by
mid ‘61. Their average quality is am: wzingly
high—though some of the commoner ones
might prove flat and dull, being too low in acid

—the estate bottlings, from the driest to the
sweetest, have great ripeness and fruit—they
are as full bodied as the ’49s and ’53s, but with
more distinction. As always, there are some
variations in quality from one district or town-
ship to another. Truly, on the whole, a “Vint-
age of the Century”
