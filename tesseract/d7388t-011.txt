VOUVRAY

The popularity of vouvray in this country is traceable to World
War days, when the American Army Headquarters was established
at Tours amidst the vouvray vineyards. Men and officers developed
a great fondness for this charming wine.

Vouvray is light gold in color, and possesses fresh, fruity, and
gay qualities which make it the perfect luncheon wine.

VIN ROSE

The pink or rose color of these light, fresh wines is the result of
fermenting black grapes in a special manner.

They should be served chilled, and make a pleasant accompani-
ment to any meal.
