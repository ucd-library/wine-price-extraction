BONBONNE DE BEAUJOLAIS |

ate ale Oe BB:

In terms of quality, the 1969 Beaujolais vintage was out-
standing, achieving a wonderful purple-red color, a great
deal of fruit, exquisite bouquet—all coupled with charm
and balance. In terms of quantity, it was a disappoint-
ment and the prices soared rapidly because of quick
depletion. 1969 is the Beaujolais year you should drink
while you wait until 1970, which promises to be excellent,
puts in its appearance in the Spring of 1971.

Case of 4
BONBONNE DE BEAUJOLAIS...... 4.49 16.95
The Bonbonnes is a large container holding 68 oz. (only
4 oz. less than three full bottles) of excellent Beaujolais.
Like the thrifty Frenchman, this is the size you should
buy because it averages out at $1.50 the bottle. Four
Bonbonnes in case—16.95)

 

The French dictionary describes bon-
bonne ‘‘as a large glass or pottery
container for storing wines used by
French families to acquire a week, or
a month’s supply of wine.’ The thrifty,
wine loving French buy in ‘bonbonne
size’ to get a family supply of good,
everyday wine—a Gallic habit worthy
to be adapted by economy-minded
American wine lovers.

listed above, you will find elsewhere
