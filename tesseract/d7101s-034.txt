THE SPIRIT OF SOUTHERN FRANCE

Parisians long ago
discovered the
sophisticated
pleasures of pastis
—the dramatic
anis-flavored spirit
from Marseilles.
No pastis captures
as much of the
flavor of Paris and
Marseilles as does
Pernod. One sip
can transport you
to the cafés of the
Left Bank or the
bistros of the Old
Port. Makes an
excellent and
intriguing gift.
