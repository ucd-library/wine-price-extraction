We have searched long and hard
for a pleasing red and white
wine to sell under $1.00 the bot-
tle. We know of no more pleas-
ing examples available than the
red and white Bordeaux of Boyer
Freres.

BORDEAUX ROUGE 1953, Boyer Freres
No ordinary regional wine this! An authentic 1953 from
Bordeaux’s most important firm. Price has moved up sub
stantially in Bordeaux since acquisition because of 1953
depletion and frost damage.

CHIANTI, Buzzoni (Quart Wicker )

\ pleasant red table wine from Tuscany—in the traditional,

colorful, wicker bottle at a cost of only 3¢ the fluid ounce.

BORDEAUX BLANC 1953, Boyer Freres
A distinguished counterpart to the Bordeaux Rouge de
scribed above — medium dry, pleasant and full of fruit.
From an impeccable shipper.

vineyards of Germany, Alsace,
Bordeaux, the Loire and Provy-
ence. You can make up a superb
selection for summer drinking
from this group.

BEAUJOLAIS 1955, Domaine du Ringuet

Our best-seller among our red wines and for good reason

we quote the review this wine received in the New
York Times, January 29th, ‘‘then there is a Beaujolais that
is all a Beaujolais should be, but alas, seldom in this
country purplish-red, with the fruity aroma and taste
of crushed grapes. In our opinion, a true discovery for
those who want true Beaujolais at a modest price.”

CHATEAU VERDIGNAN 1952

From the Haut Medoc of Bordeaux comes this distin
guished Chateau bottled Claret. A real beauty. Only 18
cases remain.

MUSCADET 1955, Chateau de la Bidiere
One of the most popular of the delicate, dry white wines
of the Loire Valley. Our sales have multiplied ten times
in one year.

ALSATIAN RIESLING 1955, Hanhart

From the steep hills of Alsace comes this young, fresh,
dry white wine. Rich with charm and bouquet.

ANJOU, BLANC DE BLANC, 1953

A most pleasing dry white wine of the Loire — approxi-
mates in taste, color and dry delicacy, the still, non-
sparkling Champagnes that are so popular in France.
HOCHHEIMER DAUBHAUS 1955,

F. Kries

The distinguishing characteristics of Hochheimer are mild-

ness and softness with a trace of earthy taste. Here is a
fine example.

BERNCASTELER BRAUNES 1955

for warm weather menus.

GRAACHER HIMMELREICH 1955

Well balanced, fragrant and fine.

ANJOU ROSE 1955 (Chateau Tigne )

Chateau de Tigne, the most highly regarded vineyard of

the area.

LA RESERVE ROSE 1955 (Provence )
This delightful pink wine reflects the spirit, color and
gaiety of the Cote d’Azur. A selection of “La Reserve
Restaurant,” Beaulieu-sur-Mer.

BONNE AUBERGE ROSE
Under this friendly name — “The Good Country Inn”

La Bonne Auberge, located at Antibes, is known through-
out France as one of the finest eating places in Europe.
This charming ‘“‘Vin Rose’’ is typical of the wine served

there.

Don't let the low price of $1.29
deceive you — fine thorough-
breds can be found in this group.
You can make up your own as-
sortment of any twelve bottles in
this group and enjoy the case
price.

74 CHATEAU LESTAGES 1949
One of the most extraordinary Claret opportunities eve
offered during the last decade. Here is a 1949 Claret of
distinction and breed at a price considerably below the
usual cost of the average regional wine.

91 PUISSEGUIN ST. EMILION 1953, Boyer 162
A good St. Emilion is now hard to come by because of
the February 1956 frost. Several years will elapse before
they will be in good supply again. Here is a most satisfy
ing example at exceptionally low cost.

211 BEAUJOLAIS 1955, Montmelas

A pleasing, young example of France’s most popular red

wine. 140

284 CHATEAU FAYAU 1955 (Cadillac)

From the land that lies between two Bordeaux rivers of 161
Garonne and the Dordogne, comes some of the most full-

flavored, medium dry and delightful white wine of the

world. Here is one that carries the kind of richness and

fruitiness usually associated with Sauternes. An astonish

ing value.

530 LIEBFRAUMILCH 1955, Gebrueder Lob

A pleasing example of the ever popular Liebfraumilch. 184
