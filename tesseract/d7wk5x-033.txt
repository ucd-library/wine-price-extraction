ing the Spring of 1956, tasting wine after wine, to make certain that the
1955 wines we would ultimately offer would be beyond reproach. In our
opinion, many of the great treasures of Burgundy are included in the
list below.

Here are wines in the classic tradition, beautifully balanced, and ideally
suited for laying down. Because of the unsatisfactory quality, generally,
of both the 1954 and 1956 among the red Burgundies, followed by the
frost damage of 1957, we think it particularly advantageous to acquire

these scarce estate-botilings.
