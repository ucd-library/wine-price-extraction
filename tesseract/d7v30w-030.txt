True vintage Port is rare wine indeed—and is unquestionably considered to be
great. Since vintage Ports are long-lived, they are often called “investment
wines,” because their value goes up with each passing year.

Never in our long experience as wine merchants have we ever
observed such excitement and eagerness to acquire vintage Ports
as with the 1985s. To a certain extent this happened before with
the 1963s and 1977s—but it was not quite the same. The facts are
clear. 1985 is truly a great, long-lived, rich, full-flavored Port
vintage that will prove to be a worthy successor to both the 1963s
and 1977s. We offer a selection of these true gems below. We
urge that you acquire the 1985s promptly.

Robert Parker, in The Wine Advocate reports: “... they [the ’83
Ports] are very concentrated, very rich wines. From a stylistic
standpoint, the 1983 may be closest in quality and character to the
1970s, a wonderful vintage.”
