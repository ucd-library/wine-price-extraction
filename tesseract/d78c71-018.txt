Disti ished

qua as 4 These wines and spirits proudly bear the name of St. Edmund Hall, one of
the 32 independent institutions of learning which, collectively, comprise
the University of Oxford. St. Edmund Hall, which can be identified on the
ancient map above (1713), dates its origin back to the 13th Century.
Some of you may have seen St. Edmund Hall’s medieval library which ap-
04 peared so prominently in the recent film “Accident.” It is with no small
sense of pride that we offer these carefully selected wines and spirits to the
discriminating drinkers of New York.

The bust of Sir Thomas Bodley (1545-1613) was given to the University in 1605, in the
sitter’s lifetime, by the Earl of Dorset. Nicholas Stone, the sculptor, recorded at that
time, in his notebook that — ‘Il was paid £100 of good mony.”’!
