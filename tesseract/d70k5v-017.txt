Back in 1831, when S. S. Pierce Co. first opened their doors, Andrew Jackson was
President of the United States, Abraham Lincoln had just become 21, and the
national debt was not quite $50,000,000. During the 117 years that have since
elapsed, S. S. Pierce Co. has developed a national reputation for integrity, high
quality, and honest value.
We are consequently proud indeed to be able to offer the superior wines and
