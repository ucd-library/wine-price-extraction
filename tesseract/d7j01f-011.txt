The 1966 BEAUJOLAIS VILLAGES arrived during early December
on the S/S Queen Mary—bottled within three months of grape pick-
ing—the kind of Beaujolais they are drinking in Paris today. The
reward in young Beaujolais is great—rich in fruit—reminiscent of
a grape arbor, and, like a “pretty young girl from the farm,” it
must be enjoyed NOW, during its youth. We have sold many cases,
and rarely, in our experience, has so much enthusiastic acclaim been
showered on a wine.

And, in the last harvest, MUSCADET, CUVEE BEAUREGARD
1966—the lovely white wine of the Loire—also flourished—and
it too, is here, right now, to bestow its delight. Our associate, James
Beard, after tasting, commented, “here is the disarming country
white wine of France at its best — delightful bouquet, charming
freshness, easy drinkability—certainly one of the best Muscadets
I have ever tasted.”

A WORD OF ADVICE—we suspect these first shipments of Beau-
jolais Villages ’66 and Muscadet ’66, because of the world acclaim
given this publicized vintage year, will be depleted, we fear, before
replacements reach us. We therefore urge that you order now to
avoid disappointment and be the “first on your block” to taste two
superb wines grown in this outstanding year of 1966.
