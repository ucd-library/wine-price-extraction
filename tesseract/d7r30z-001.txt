Jo A. GA VY om 7 FE SIVV: E Su Vy KV R,

The wise and imaginative choice of wines and spirits can add
much to summer living. This booklet was created by our staff
in the belief that it will help you choose wisely. One of the
staff members, James Beard, author of “Cook It Outdoors”
has contributed a chapter which points out the relationship
of good wine and good food to good summer living.

In these pages, you will discover that all French wines listed
reflects the full price advantage resulting from the recent
devaluation of the franc. Because of their present low cost,
these wines should not be overlooked in planning your
summer menus and entertaining.

We also wish to stress that we can continue to supply your
needs, even though you may leave town for all or part of the
summer. We ship to all points where regulations permit, and
maintain free daily delivery service to Westchester and Long

Island.
