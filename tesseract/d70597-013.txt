passed by 1961.

355 NUITS ST. GEORGES, ARGILLIERES ... 7.95 85.85

enthusiasm. Estate-bottled, H. Gilles.

1010 LATRICIERES CHAMBERTIN ........--- 7.99 86.30
Can compete with Chambertin itself. Estate-bottled,

Cuvee Dames de la Charite—acquired at the annual Hos-
pice de Beaune auction in November 1966. The 1971

1964 VINTAGE

We quote from the Time-Life book ‘Wines & Spirits’—“1964—
rich in fruit, well balanced, big and sturdy. Sufficient depth and
staying power to indicate many glorious years ahead.”

354 MAZOYERES CHAMBERTIN ........--- Too 86.30

bred.

229 ROMANEE ST. VIVANT .....-------+::° 12.95 140.00
M. Drouhin is considered the dean of Burgundy. This
Romanée St. Vivant 1964 is a pride of his reserve wine
cellar. A few cases of this treasured wine has reached us.

798 VOSNE-ROMANEE, LA GRANDE RUE. . .16.50 178.20
If there was a better red wine produced in Burgundy
during the 1964 vintage, we are yet to find it. Truly great.
Estate-bottled, H. Lamarche.

1963 VINTAGE

Far from a banner year in Burgundy, 1963 did turn out some
astonishing surprises. Certainly the Clos de la Roche of Ponsot
and the Grands Echezeaux of Mugneret will provide superb
Burgundy at dramatically low cost for those who choose to
adventure.

1003

1963 VINTAGE (cont'd)

However, the most startling of the 63s come from that glittering
jewel of Burgundy—the Domaine de la Romanée-Conti. The pro-
prietors gambled on a harvest, waiting two weeks after most
other growers had picked, thus reaping the benefits of steady
sunshine during that fortnight. Ready to drink now, these extra-
ordinary wines of the Domaine de la Romanée-Conti can hold
their heads high in the best of company.

No. Bottle Case

283. CLOS DE LA ROGHE .........------++:: 3.99 43.10
Clos de la Roche is one of the great ‘Grand Crus’ of Bur-
gundy, particularly when Ponsot is the estate-bottler.
Don’t let the low price discourage you—you will fall in
love with this wine.

278 GRANDS ECHEZEAUX ........---++++:: 4.99 53.90
Like the Domaine de la Romanée-Conti, this wine was
picked two weeks after the general harvest period, thus
providing added sunshine. Estate-bottled, Mongeard-
Mugneret.

409 GRANDS ECHEZEAUX .........---+-:::: 9.95 107.45
Delicate, subtle and utterly delicious. Estate-bottled, Do-
maine de la Romanée-Conti.

eey RICHEBOURG <......-. 225s e erect es ees 11.95 129.00
The greatness of this vineyard is legendary. Soft and
velvety. Estate-bottled, Domaine de la Romanée-Conti.

esg TA TAGHE 56 ee 12.95 140.00
In our opinion, La Tache is quite the equal of Romanée-
Conti itself, though substantially lower in price level.
Fantastic and memorable.

478 ROMANEE-CONTI ........-:--+seeeeee: 24.50 264.60
Grace and elegance reign supreme here. A glory. Estate-
bottled, Domaine de la Romanée-Conti.

1962 VINTAGE

The recent Time-Life Wine Book states “The ’62s are not simply
good, but can be considered great. Red Burgundies ideally
suited for present drinking.”

289 AUXEY-DURESS, DURESSES .........-- 4.39 47.40
We share the opinion of André Surmain of the Lutece
Restaurant who believes this relatively unknown Bur-
gundy represents the best value for those who want out-
standing wine at relatively modest cost. Estate-bottled,
René Roy.

310 VOLNAY CHAMPANS .......-.---+-+::> 4.99 53.90
Superb vineyard, just south of Pommard—often surpasses
the best of the Pommards. A discovery. Estate-bottled,
Marquis d’Angerville.

325 CORTON MARECHAUDES ..........--- 8.49 91.70
From the superb Marechaudes vineyard. A rather full-
bodied wine with great breed. Estate-bottled, Prince de
Merode.

341 CHARMES CHAMBERTIN ......-.-.---: 8.49 91.70
Full, round and graceful. A classic for present consump-
tion. Estate-bottled, Camus.

233. BEAUNE, CUVEE BRUNET ..........----> 8.95 96.65
Acquired at the Hospice de Beaune. Worth double.
1002 LATRICIERES CHAMBERTIN ........--- 8.95 96.65

To understand how rare this wine is, this ‘Grand Cru’
vineyard is only 17 acres in size. We doubt that 50 cases
remain undrunk throughout the world. Estate-bottled,

«OLDER
RED BURGUNDIES

Two authentic survivors of the famed Albert Barolet collection
still remain in our cellars. Dr. Barolet was one of the most dis-
tinguished physicians in the Burgundy area. He died in 1969 at
the age of 71. These two noble red wines are from his extra-
ordinary estate, possibly the most important wine legacy left
in Burgundy during the 20th century.

598 VOSNE-ROMANEE 1953 .......-.-+---+:: 13.50 145.00
The most remarkable wine producing commune of all
France. Fine, with very rich overtones. Bouquet out-
standing—flavorful.

529 CHAMBOLLE-MUSIGNY 1952 .........-- 16.50 175.00
1952 is among the most long lived years in Burgundy, and
this wine proves it—just emerging. Beautiful color, not
big, but beautifully balanced.
