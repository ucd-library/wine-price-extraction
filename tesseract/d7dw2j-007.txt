ROBERT MONDAVI-—In Napa Valley, the
Mondavi vineyard is considered a wine shrine
dedicated to excellence. If ever a Chateau
Lafite Rothschild is born in the Napa Valley,
it will probably take place here. It is Mon-
davi’s Cabernet Sauvignon that is proudly
served at the White House and at the State
Department to honor distinguished guests.

MOUNT VEEDER -— Michael and Sam Aaron
have only recently visited the Domaine de la
Romanee Conti. Soon thereafter, their love of
wine brought them to the high hilly vineyards
on the slopes of Mt. Veeder, not far from Napa.
They discovered the Goldsteins who give the
same loving care to nurturing wine that the
Domaine does in Burgundy. Here are two of
the most glorious wines ever produced in
America.

SCHRAMSBERG — Schramsberg was the fa-
vorite vineyards of Robert Louis Stevenson.
Our friend, Jack Davies, took over and at-
tempted to make Champagnes that would com-
pete in dryness, bouquet and character with
the better ones of France. The wine-tasters of
the world acknowledge that he has succeeded.
Although we must limit the sale to two bottles
to a customer, we are afraid we will run out.

Gamay Beaujolais that has won them their

SOUVERAIN OF ALEXANDER VALLEY—
Until recently, there were two Souverains—the
Souverain of Rutherford sold their winery to
Freemark Abbey. Remaining is the beautiful
Souverain of Alexander Valley which repre-
sents sheer poetry in stainless steel and oak
barrels—all dominated by two lofty towers
along the Russian River in Sonoma. The bar-
rels are surprisingly small, as in France—the
reason is that this made it possible to watch
the development of each of their many single
vineyards that dot the landscape of Sonoma
and Mendocino.

It was the quality potentials of the small bar-
rels that attracted Bill Bonetti to take on the
job as wine-maker, after spending twelve cre-
ative years at Charles Krug. In his own quiet
way, Bonetti is ultimately looking to produce
a Bonnes Mares, Petrus or Corton Charlemagne
among these hills. Only time will tell. We are
rooting for him. Note how long these prices
presently are. They will surely go up.
