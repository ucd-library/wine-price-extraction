as those of Napa and Sonoma Valleys are north of the
equator. Here too, the better European grape varieties
thrive—yielding wines of good character and of the classic
tradition.

Seppelt has been producing wine in Australia for well over
one hundred years and the excellence of their efforts Is
now acknowledged internationally. For curious wine lovers
interested in experiencing these intriguing wines, we offer

both an outstanding red and a delightful white to tempt you
