INTERIOR VIEW OF OUR SHOP

It is interesting to observe the present enthusiasm for native
wines. Many people are now drinking them for the first
time. Should the inquisitive buyer be sold an inferior bottle,
only too easily might he condemn all American wines. This
situation makes the wine merchant’s good judgment even
more important.

Here, at Sherry Wine & Spirits Co., Inc. you will find one
of the most complete collections in the land of French
Champagnes, Bordeaux, and Burgundies. Nevertheless, we

do take American wines seriously. In arriving at this list,

we have applied the same principles that guided our selec-

tion of European wines. We have studied the vineyards. we
have tried to remain open-minded, we have tasted, edited
and finally selected. Rightly or wrongly, we honestly ae
the nation’s best wine endeavors are incorporated in chic list.
