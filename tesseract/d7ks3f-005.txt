—F3RURGUNDIES

BURGUNDY lovers cannot ignore these fantastic 1966s—why?
We know that Vintage Charts proclaim the 1967 as a failure—
and, alas! the 1968 is even proving more disastrous! The
Burgundians now consider their ’66s the only precious jewels
that remain in their cellars.

These wine gems are doled out slowly, usually to favored
clients; and the prices quoted reflect their scarcity and ex-

Light, fresh, fruity, quick maturing. Can be enjoyed immediately.

cellence. We shudder to think of the astronomic heights some
of these wines will reach a year from now.

In support of our enthusiasm for the red Burgundies of the
1966 Vintage, we quote from “Wines and Spirits” just pub-
lished by Time-Life Books, Inc., “Outstanding year. Great
fragrance, fruit, and superb balance. Will prove to be a better
year than ’64 or 59. Shows remarkable promise of longevity.”

Gelin owns some of the best vineyard land in this extraordinary wine
commune. Our tasting notes read, ‘exceptional power, obviously longs

lived, great class’.

POMMARD RUGIENS, Lejeune. ...

Intriguing ‘gout de terroir’ taste. A ‘best buy’ in red Burgundy.

ALOXE CORTON, Tollot-Beaut....

Delicate, good nose, maturing early. Drink within the next 5 years.

BEAUNE GREVES, Mme. Duchet...
‘Greves’ is best vineyard of Beaune. Remarkable balance and grace.
Long-lived.

FIXIN CLOS NAPOLEON, Gelin...
Little-known, therefore among best values in fine Burgundy. Comparable
in character and quality to the better vineyards of Gevrey-Chambertin.

VOSNE-ROMANEE, Mugneret.....

From a vineyard only a three minute walk from La Tache, Richebourg
and Romanee-Conti. Breed, elegance, balance, and fine bouquet are the
distinguishing characteristics.

Soft, well-balanced, color medium, very fruity, much breed.

Freueix, Mugneret.<..........., 0

Mugneret cultivates this 8 acre ‘first growth’ vineyard magnificently.
Generous, soft, well-balanced, firm, fuller in body than most Burgundies.

Room Prevents us from giving an individual description of
each wine but it would not be an exaggeration to state that
we are dealing with the most precious jewels of the entire
Cote d’Or—the glories among the vineyards—and by such im-
peccable producers as Henri Gouges, the revered dean of all
growers; Prince de Merode who cultivates his vine in royal
fashion; Henri Lamarche who commands the highest prices
of any grower outside of Comte de Vogué and Romanée-Conti;

buy them now—hardly any will be available by
1970. But more important than the economic reasons, is the
sheer privilege of getting them at all—while they are still
available.
