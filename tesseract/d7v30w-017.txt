 

 

he wines of Italy have experienced a major renais-

sance during the last two decades. In the 1960s,

Chianti, Soave and Valpolicella predominated on our

wine list, with a few minor excursions into the realms

of Barolo and Barbaresco. Today our shop boasts almost 200

wines from Italy—a great range of wines—from Sicily in the

South, through Tuscany, and on through the Piedmont in the
north.

The time has arrived when the rewards are great for those

who venture among the wonderful wines of Italy. The list

belowis a selection of top-flight wines from our own explorations.
